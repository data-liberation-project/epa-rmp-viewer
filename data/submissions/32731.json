Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for passive mitigation was not taken into account when modeling this scenario.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 3/4\" bleed valve sheer from the incoming feed line to the Splitter Charge Tank.  The line contains a liquefied mixture of propane and propylene at approximately 300 psig and 80 F.  For reasons discussed above, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propylene in the feed line.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes and ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario would be mitigated by means of the emergency shutdown system and the activation of the emergency response team.

The simulated end point distance to the 1 psig overpressure would result in off-site impacts.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for passive mitigation was not taken into account when modeling this scenario.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) = Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the simulation of a 3/4\" bleed valve sheer from the incoming feed line to the Splitter Charge Tank.  The line contains a liquefied mixture of propane and propylene at approximately 300 psig and 80 F.  For reasons discussed above, the simulation assumed the worst-case concentration of 100% propylene in the feed line.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes and ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenari"

Our Process Safety Management Systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - \"PSSR\"\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n* Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permit\n\n* Contractors\n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have a multitude of programs in which our employees participate.  We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\n\n\nWe have an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies in the process equipment prior to any incident.\n\n\n\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is detected, it is reported to management in order to expedientl"

For each of these incidents (as defined by OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard), formal incident investigations are conducted to identify and correct the root causes of the events.  There have been no RMP-defined accidental releases of hazardous material from Enterprise's Propylene Processing Facility within the last five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu group, which includes the Mont Belvieu Police, fire department, and Emergency Medical Service as well as the Chambers County Emergency Management system.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nEnterprise personnel are continuously reviewing and improving our PSM systems, especially in the areas of operating procedures and training programs. \n\n        \n\n\n\n"
