      "SummaryText": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires facilities that process more than a threshold quantity of certain listed hazardous substances to develop and implement a risk management program, and to submit a summary of their risk management program to the EPA. The facility is covered by the rule because it uses anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory threshold. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity. \n\n\n\nThe facility is submitting an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the regulatory requirement to fully update the RMP at least once every five years. The most recent full update was August 18th 2014; therefore, this five-year update is due no later than August 18th 2019. The purpose of this project was to prepare the RMP update for the Fort Worth, Texas facility.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on the High Pressure Receiver (HPR). The HPR is the vessel that could potentially hold the greatest amount of ammonia. The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumes that 41,000 pounds of ammonia are released to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's general guidance document for risk management programs, and confirmed by EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp. The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 2.3 miles. It was further determined that within 2.3 miles of the facility there is a population of approximately 38,000 people. The public receptors identified within 2.3 miles of the facility are residences, schools, hospitals, recreational areas, and commercial/industrial areas. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario examined a release due to the pressure relief valve protecting the low-temp receiver (LTR) fulling lifting. For the alternative release scenario, it was assumed that the vessel contained a"

The population within 0.1 miles of the facility was determined to be 60 people. Residences were the only public or environmental receptors identified within 0.1 miles of the facility.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidents involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nThe updated report includes updated prevention program review dates and other activities associated with the prevention program. \n\n"
