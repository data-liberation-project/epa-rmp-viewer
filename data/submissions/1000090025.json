It is facility policy of adhere to applicable Federal, State and Local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Response Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planniny Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the relase and minimize the impact of the release to emplyees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for personal use not for resale.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia is approximatley 89566 pounds stored in one 18000 galllon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 85 % of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario And Alternate Release Scenario:  Thew worls case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank releases as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 89566, which represents the volume of storage a 85 % of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distace to the endpoint is 3.4 Miles.  The alternate release scenario involves the release of anhydrous ammonia from a breakdown/rupture in a three inch hose during transfer of ammonia from the storage tank to a nurse tank.   The quantity of ammonia released as a gas would be approximately 95 pounds.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program:  The facility complies with the EPA's Accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulatio"
