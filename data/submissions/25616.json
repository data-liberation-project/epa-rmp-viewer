(PPP) and operated by CSW Energy, Inc. (CSW).  The power and steam generated for sale is produced from a single natural gas turbine in combination with a single steam turbine.\n\n\n\nMulberry Cogen has two RMP regulated substances at the facility, anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.  The ammonia is used in a closed loop system for cooling the inlet air to the combustion turbine.  Total quantity in the entire system of vessels and piping is approximately 49,500 lbs.  It is located adjacent to the combustion turbine and its evaporative condenser (Inlet Cooling Tower).  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine is stored in three one-ton cylinders located near the two cooling towers.  The chlorine is used for microbiological control in the cooling tower waters.  Whereas most of the chlorine is absorbed and consumed by the water, a low (0.3 ppm free Cl2) residual is maintained in the bulk water.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nMulberry Cogen has been in commercial operation since August 10, 1994 and has had one reportable accidental release of ammonia and no reportable releases of chlorine.  A second release of ammonia that was reported was later evaluated and determined to have released less than the reportable amount.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nMulberry Cogen Facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local statues governing the storage and use of all chemicals.  This includes compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Program, EPA's Risk Management Program, and Hazardous Chemical reporting under SARA Title III.\n\n\n\nSince communication and knowledge are important preventative measures in a safety program, a Right-To-Know center in the Control Room provides safety informati"

Contained in the center are Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), the Emergency Response Guidebook, The Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards, and Keller's Official OSHA Safety Handbook, Health Effects of Ammonia, and Control of Natural Gas In Emergency.  \n\n\n\nThe Mulberry Cogeneration Facility was constructed with many safeguards for chemical handling and usage.  The hazardous liquid chemicals on site, sulfuric acid and caustic, are stored in tanks surrounded by secondary containment.  The pumps used to deliver the chemicals to the various processes are also inside the containment dike.  Chemical piping is double-piped where appropriate.  UV resistant tubing has been employed for delivery of chlorine and other chemicals where tubing is exposed to sunlight.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCSW Energy - Mulberry Operations is committed to maintaining a safe working environment while using chemicals necessary for power production and its auxiliary processes. CSW Energy maintains a Safety Manual and supplements it with written manuals from equipment vendors and chemical suppliers. Personnel protective equipment is made available to all employees and training is given annually to demonstrate the proper use of the safety equipment provided. In addition specific training is given each year on regulated substances; ammonia, chlorine, mercury, ferrous sulfate, caustic, and sulfuric acid.  The MSDS for new chemicals are routed for all personnel to review. \n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) was written and implemented beginning with construction of the plant and continuing on through present day plant operations.  Features of the EAP include plant communications and alarm systems, evacuation procedures and routes, fire and rescue equipment, general fire protection guidelines, emergency notification procedures and emergency response procedures.  The EAP also includes a separate section on a"

Employees are trained to be familiar with the contents of the EAP and several copies of the EAP are readily available in the case of an emergency at the facility.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nCSW - Mulberry Operations chose to model the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios for ammonia with a model commonly used by the ammonia industry known as DEGADIS (tm).  For the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for chlorine we used the EPA's RMP Comp (tm) model.\n\n\n\nAmmonia \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is the rupture in a vessel with the loss of the entire system contents, 49,500 pounds.  The system is located near the Main Cooling Tower, which may have some drafting affect as passive mitigation.  However since it can not be defined, no credit was taken in the modeling for any passive mitigation.\n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario, more likely to occur, is the release of only the portion of the ammonia contained in the liquid receiver.  This is approximately 25,000 pounds.  A portion of  this ammonia would spill in the form of a liquid and would subsequently be evaporated.  The remainder would be released as a gas.  Active mitigation which would help contain the release includes manual water hoses for use as a water curtain and isolation valves to minimize the quantity.  Similar to the worst case scenario, no credit was taken for any passive or active mitigation.\n\n\n\nThe probability of either release is remote.  The ammonia vessels are inside a controlled area from the public.  Any contractors working in the area are advised of the ammonia vessels and care is taken to prevent vehicles or forklifts from approaching the area unless absolutely necessary.  The system is also designed with safety release valves to protect from over-pressurization.  All employees receive training on the ammonia system, it's operation and safety features.\n\n\n\nChlorine\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the rupture of a one ton cylinder of chlorine.  Since the chlorine storage is located in close proximity to a forced draft cooling tower it is assumed that the tower would act to have some passive mitigating affect on a chlorine release.  Chlorine gas would be drawn into the tower and quenched with the falling water in a countercurrent fashion.  Although this mitigation may be affective, no credit was taken for the absorption of chlorine in the cooling tower when modeling the toxic endpoint of the release.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the release of  the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder through a 1\" opening, a fault in a fusible plug.  Again some passive mitigation could occur due to the proximity of the cooling towers.  However no credit was taken for the passive mitigation in the modeling.\n\n\n\nActive mitigation during the alternative release scenario includes the use of a chlorine cylinder leak repair kit. A cylinder leak kit is staged in the area of the cylinders and all employees are trained in the use of the repair kit.  Again, although this mitigation action is possible during a chlorine release, no reduction in time or amount was considered when modeling the release.\n\n\n\nAlthough this summary has outlined two potentially large releases of chlorine gas, the probability of a release of this nature happening is remote.  The cylinders are located in an area which is protected from vehicle traffic and industrial activity.  The overhead hoist used for loading and unloading cylinders on or off the delivery truck is always stored resting on the ground beside the cylinders.  This is to prevent any possible damage due to a falling hoist, while the cylinders are unattended.  The leak washer around the service valve is replaced with each new cylinder placed in use.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nCSW Energy - Mulberry Operations reports for Mulberry Cogen the hazardous chemicals on site, amount and location, to both the Local E"
