      "SummaryText": "Brakebush Bros Inc, located at N4993 6th Dr, Westfield Wis is a family owned poultry processing facility that has been in operation in this area for over 75 years. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility for processing and to provide cooling for storage rooms. Our refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between 15\"  vacuum on the low side to a high side pressure of 210 psi. The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any one time is estimated at 155,360 pounds.\n\n\n\nWorst case release scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nOur worst case release scenario would be a failure of the High Pressure Reciever in our refrigeration system.The  High Pressure Reciever (HPR) measures 8' dia by 24' high with a maximum capacity of 45,216 lbs.It is located outside the building, no passive mitigation was considered. Although normal operating level of this HPR is between 8,600 to 13,000 lbs the worst case analysis takes into account that the HPR might be full. Using the tables and equations found in chapter 4 of EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the toxic endpoint was calculated at 3.6 miles. Based on census data, within this radius is a population of 864, residential housing, and a few retail businesses. There are no hospitals located within this area.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using EPA's RMP Guidance for ammonia refrigeration reference tables and equations. Apressure relief valve failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables in RMP guidance, a ten minute release of ammonia at 120 lbs/min. from the HPR relief valve would affect an area of 0.2 miles. The estimated population  within distance to endpoint is 0.There is a retail business, some residences but no schools or hospitals.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nBrakebush Bros Inc has established an in house emergency re"

The facility has also established annual refresher training for all personnel that are on the Hazmat team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all personnel are prepared in the event of an emergency. We have also coordinated efforts with the Marquette county HAZMAT team to establish a joint response program. These established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nBrakebush Bros Inc. has trained selected personnel, including refrigeration operators in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response, OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine the appropriate level of response to initiate.This could be by simply tightening a flange bolt or packing gland, or initiating a system shut down. Brakebush Bros has established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the emergency shut down and isolation in the event of a release.Brakebush Bros has also purchased HAZMAT equipment consisting of ; level A and B chemical suits, MSA SCBA equipment, cartridge type gas masks with ammonia cartridges, face shields, safety glasses, rubber gloves and boots. The hazmat team has been trained in the Incident Command Structure system and will coordinate their efforts with the Marquette county HAZMAT team.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nThere has been two accidental releases in the last five years, none with offsite impact.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nBrakebush Bros has not only complied with the EPA Risk Management Program but also OSHA Process Safety Management regulations to assure that the ammonia refrigeration sy"
