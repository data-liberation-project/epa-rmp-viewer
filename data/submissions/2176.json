The facility is inspected yearly by what we consider two valuable indentities. These are the NC Department of Environmental Health,Public Water Section and NC League of Municipalities. We  feel that working closely with these agencies has provided us with the necessary information to continuously adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations pertaining to chlorine Cl2.  Our training involves local emergency agencies and it is a written policy of PSM of this facility to notify the Shelby Fire Department of any release in order for them to respond and investigate.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nThe Shelby Water Treartment facility has the capability of treating 12 million-gallons a day of water  which is fed by the Broad river. The regulated substance on site for water treatment purposes is Chlorine Cl2 which is used as a disinfectant in water.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nOur worst-case scenario is based on a liquid spill and vaporization of a one ton cylinder filled with 2,000 pounds of chlorine resulting in the total release of the entire cylinder product over a ten-minute period at a approximately 1.5m/sec wind speed. According to the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference tables, the distance to the end point is 1.33 miles of urban terrian. This release has the potential to spread in an area containing 2 schools, 3 convalescent centers, a 261-bed unit hospital, and a prison annex facility. The projected population of the effected area is approximately 2,000 people. However, because of written procedures that comply with OSHA PSM standards and their enforcement along with training on such procedures and scenarios, a release of this magnitude is highly unlikely. Also items in place such as leak detectors for detection"

According to EPA's OCA Guidance Reference tables, the distance to the end point is projected to be 0.90 miles. This has the potential to spread in an area containing 2 convalescent centers,1 school and area residents effecting approximately 800 in population. Due to enforced written procedures and policies and checklists that comply with OSHA PSM standard and state and federal guidelines a scenario to this effect is extremely unlikely. Detection systems and automatic shutdown devices in vital areas are other supports for this scenario being improbable.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nThis water treatment facility complies with OSHA 1910.119 regulation for accident prevention rules and other state and federal regulations that are applicable for the safety of its employees and citizens. For critical operations, which involve chlorine Cl2, personnel working in pairs and checklists for such operations along with back up systems create a more competent prevention program. All accidents that occur at the facility,whether they are chemical related or not, are investigated to prevent the same mistake from occuring  and to display a committment to safety. Written procedures and polices are only as effective as the training that is provided to execute such programs along with employees attitude toward safety and the respect for the product.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThis facility h"

      "SummaryText": "as not had an accident involving chlorine Cl2 during the past 5 years that has caused injuries, deaths, property or environmental damage. There have been no on-site or off-site evacuations due to any accidents.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nAs  a part of the enforced written and training procedures at the facility, the Shelby Police and Fire Departments are to be notified of any emergency involving the water treatment plant chlorinating  process or any other emergency involving other chemicals on site. The Cleveland County Hazardous Materials team is also a part of the response protocol. Involvement with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and training with local agencies to understand roles and responsiblities are all items this facility has incorporated into its program.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nSince it started operating in 1953 the City of Shelby Water Treatmnet Plant has had several renovations to the facility to upgrade the safety of its operation. Recent renovations have brought with it a generator capable of providing power to the entire plant during emergencies. Also a new vacuum chlorinator has been installed that automatically stops the flow of chlorine gas if the vacuum is breached. This facility has a good working and training relationship with the Shelby police and Fire departments along with the Local Emergency Planning Committee. With technology constantly changing the City of Shelby will progressively continue to budget ways to  improve the safety and operations of its facility along with ways to reduce inventory of regulated substances."
