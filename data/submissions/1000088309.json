We operate under the Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) policy of our parent company - SUEZ Water Technologies & Solutions (SUEZ WTS). SUEZ WTS is committed to achieving EHS excellence. This is a responsibility of management and employees in all functions. SUEZ WTS will strive to provide a safe and healthy working environment and to avoid adverse impact and injury to the environment and the communities in which we do business. Our programs must combine clear leadership by management, the participation of all employees and functions, and the use of appropriate technology in developing and distributing SUEZ WTS products and services. \n\n\n\nRequirements -\n\n\n\nComply with applicable environmental, health and safety (EHS) laws and regulations. \n\n-Take appropriate measures to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses, and to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment. Consider evolving industry practices, regulatory requirements, and societal standards of care. \n\n-Assess EHS impacts before starting a new activity or project. Consider EHS impacts in the design and production of SUEZ WTS's products and services. \n\n-Eliminate unreasonable risks from SUEZ WTS's facilities, products, services and activities. \n\n-To the extent reasonably practicable, reduce the use and release of toxic and hazardous materials, prevent pollution, and conserve, recover and recycle materials. \n\n-Continue to improve our EHS systems and performance as an integral part of SUEZ WTS's operational strategy. \n\n\n\nFacility Description and The Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nSUEZ WTS Beaumont Plant manufactures specialty water-treatment chemicals that are primarily used for the treatment of water and wastewater in industrial process systems such as boilers, refineries and cooling towers"

      "SummaryText": ". Most of our products are water based made by performing reactions within specialty reactors and then packaging into various size containers. Depending on our customers' need, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000 gallon truckload quantities. Similarly, the raw materials we receive from suppliers come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand. SUEZ WTS - Beaumont Plant covers a total of 40 acres. \n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin, Formalin, Propylene Oxide and Dimethylamine are stored onsite in aboveground storage tanks. Each of these products have unique properties used by our customers to help treat their waste or process waters. Propylene oxide is used as a component of a polymerization inhibitor product used by the chemical industry. The use of such inhibitors help the chemical industry save energy and reduce waste and fouling in the equipment. Epichlorohydrin (EPI) and Dimethylamine (DMA) are \"building block\" chemicals we use to make some of our other products. Products made with EPI are used in the paper industry to help equipment function efficiently. The benefit is the waste reduction. Products made with DMA are used to clean water in water treatment facilities. Formalin is a raw material used in the production of flocculants used to clarify water and reduce dangerous levels of sulphur in crude oil. \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate, and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment. The prevention program includes elements that cover the compilation of process safety information related to the process, performance of process hazard review to identify and evaluate potential release scenarios, development and use of op"

The prevention program also includes requirements for performing compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program. \n\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nIn the past five years the SUEZ WTS - Beaumont Plant had one accidental release that resulted in onsite injury to an employee during the handling of a mixture of 13% Dimethylamine and water. We estimated that less than lb of DMA was released during the event. The site initiated an incident investigation and implemented measures to prevent reoccurence. \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program \n\n\n\nOur chemical release response program contains these elements: \n\n- Identification of emergency organization personnel structure and functional responsibilities \n\n- Fire extinguisher training \n\n- Fire drills conducted by our facility \n\n- Spill and release control instructions \n\n- Evacuation procedures and external response notifications \n\n- Incident coordination with local emergency responders \n\n- Incident analysis and review with all plant personnel, and identification of procedure changes \n\n- Annual program review and re-training \n\n- Hurricane preparedness and plant readiness procedures \n\n\n\nRecent and Planned Changes To Improve Safety & Environmental \n\n\n\nSince the last RMP submittal our facility has completed the following projects geared towards  improving the facility's safety and environmental protection systems: \n\n?
