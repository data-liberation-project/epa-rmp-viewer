If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Taylor County LEPC, and/or any other authorities to mitigate and minmimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\nThis facility is a retail Farm Supply Distribution Center.  We store and distrubute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved by truck, handled and stored on site.  It is a regulated substance by EPA requiring us to comply with the risk management program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.\n\nThis facility manintains 1000 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery. See RMP Comp for our combined capacity in nurse tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a stationary storage tank on site.See RMP Comp for  the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage and the total capacity of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored on this site.\n\n     The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  The ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.  The faciilty complies with the NSI K61.1 standards EPA's accidental release prevention rule, IA Fertilizer Law Part 21 Chapter 43 Rule 43.6(200) as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut offs and emergency shut off valves.  The load out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the f"

All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local repsonse agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that our communtiy has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed  by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirements for our facility to be included in the communtiy emergency reponse plan prepared under EPRCA and coordinated with our LEPC.  In addition, Taygold Cooperative has an emergency response and contigency plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures. and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
