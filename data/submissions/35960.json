This Risk Management Plan was developed for the propane system. The 30,000-gallon propane storage tank is located south of the propane filling station.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe propane system at Hoeganaes is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Rule (PSM Rule).  The management system developed based on this regulation together with elements of the Risk Management Program results in a comprehensive prevention program.  Hoeganaes is committed to maintain this system. \n\nThe elements of the prevention program include: an employee training program, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for numerous operations, a maintenance program, a system to manage changes at the plant to ensure that safety and employee training issues are addressed, a hot work permit program, a program for ensuring that contractors are trained and informed of hazards, and a system to review new or modified sources before start-up to ensure safety.\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of industry standards that Hoeganaes recognizes as generally acceptable good engineering practices that it may use as the basis for design, construction, and selection of materials including: American National Standards Institute, American Society for Testing and Materials, American Welding Society, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, National Fire Protection Agency, Instrument Society of America, National Electrical Code (Class I, Division 2, Group F), Internati"

This plan identifies the trained emergency personnel at the facility as well as the off-site response contractors.  The plan also gives instructions on contacting governmental and community responders.  An annual emergency response drill is held at the plant.\n\nHoeganaes has assigned roles for its Site Emergency Coordinator and alternate, and Emergency Response Coordinator and alternates.  These personnel are responsible for emergency actions as well as coordination with state and local agencies on a 24-hour basis.  The Site Emergency Coordinator functions as the leader of the emergency response team and initiates the appropriate telephone calls notifying plant personnel and emergency services and also implements immediate steps to contain or eliminate the hazardous condition.  The Emergency Response Coordinator initiates response notification to the National Response Center and the state and monitors the release area.  The Emergency Response Team provides additional support.\n\nAs needed, off-site emergency response contractors trained to clean up hazardous materials spills are also on call 24-hours per day, 7 days a week.  \n\nHoeganaes has coordinated services with a number of government and community agencies who would respond to an emergency, such as the state and local police or fire departments, the ambulance squad, state and county emergency response officials, and an area hospital.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nHoeganaes is committed to maintaining a safe and efficient facility.
