IF AN EMERGENCY IS TO HAPPEN OUR POLICY IS TO CALL 911.\n\nOUR FACILITY IS A GRAIN, FERTILIZER, FEED, AND CHEMICAL PLANT. WE SELL NH3 TO FARMERS IN THE SPRING FOR A SOURCE OF NITROGEN FOR THEIR CORN ACRES. OUR NH3 TANK IS A 30,000 GALLON TANK AND WE ALSO HAVE PIPING ABOVE AND BELOW GROUND LEVEL.\n\nOUR WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE IF OUR TANK WAS HIT AND SPLIT OPEN AND 131,000 LBS. OF NH3 WOULD DISPENSE INTO THE AIR CAUSING A TOXIC GAS RELEASE. ON OUR EPA CHART OUR ENDPOINT WOULD BE 4.4 MILES ENDANGERING UP TO 450 PEOPLE.\n\nOUR ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAPPEN IF A DELIVERY VEHICLE WOULD PULL AWAY FROM THE INTAKE LINES TO THE STORAGE TANK WITHOUT DISCONNECTING THE TRANSFER HOSE.  THE RELEASE THAT WOULD OCCUR ACCORDING TO EPA'S RMP*COMP PROGRAM WOULD HAVE AN ENDPOINT DISTANCE OF .1 MILES AFFECTING 5 PEOPLE IN RESIDENTL AREAS.\n\nART'S MILLING SERVICE INC. COMPLIES WITH ALL OF EPA'S ACCIDENT PREVENTION RULE AND ALL STATE AND LOCAL CODES, AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO US.  OUR NH3 TANK IS STALLED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE TO OSHA (29 CFR 1910.11) AND STATE LAWS.\n\nWE HAVE HAD NO ACCIDENTS IN THE PAST 5 YEARS INVOLVING NH3 WHICH HAS CAUSED DEATH, SERIOUS INJURY OR INJURY TO PERSONAL PROPERTY.\n\nIN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY INVOLVING NH3, IT IS OUR POLICY TO CALL 911. THE HOWARD COUNTY LEPC HAS OUR EMEREGEMCY RESPONSE PLAN.\n\nWE HAVE NO CHANGES TO BE MADE WITH OUR NH3 SETUP."
