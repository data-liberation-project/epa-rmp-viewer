For example, this facility is implementing an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This is a system that uses a real time database to track inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.  Training is tracked on an internal spreadsheet.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the Holland Energy facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as with the Beecher City Volunteer Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Holland Energy facility is currently under construction and will be a 650 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant located in Shelby County, Illinois.  This is one of the new merchant power projects being developed in the Midwest.\n\nThe design of the facility incorporates a 2-on-1 configuration, 650 MW (nominal) combined cycle plant that includes two single-fuel combustion turbine generators (CTG's), each linked to a supplementary-fired heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), producing steam to drive one common condensing steam turbine generator (STG).  The plant is designed to operate in base or peaking load conditions with natural gas as the primary fuel.  Currently, no back up fuels are planned.\n\nThe project site is located in Holland Township, Shelby County, Illinois directly nor"

The facility is capable of producing power that is then distributed.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored on-site to provide ammonia vapor to control NOx emissions at each of the facilities two (2) heat recovery steam generator stacks.\n\nThe Holland Energy plant has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used to control NOx in the steam generator stacks (DENOx System).\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 54,350 pounds with administrative controls.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Holland Energy facility in Beecher City, IL.\n\n3.0 Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe ammonia storage tank has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a release from the system. Although the alternative release scenario is more probable, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical. Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each regulated chemical.                                                                                                                            \n\nAmmonia\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high"

The risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1. Irritation of respiratory tract,\n2. Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\n3. Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at Holland Energy's Beecher City plant, the ammonia DENOx system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a release from the system. Although the alternative release scenario is more probable, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical.  Given the safety precautions at the plant, both scenarios are unlikely to occur.\n\nThe ammonia release scenarios were modeled using EPA's RMP*COMP to obtain the distance to\nendpoint.  The endpoint, as defined by the US EPA, is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline,\nLevel - 2 (ERPG-2).  The ERPG-2 was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association and is applicable to human exposures for up to one hour.  The ERPG-2 is intended to protect individuals from health threatening or escape impairing injury and is not generally considered fatal.\n\n 4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Holland Energy facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia DENOx system. Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, t"

The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n3. The plant has developed a strong preventive maintenance and inspection program.\n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: May 1, 1997 - May 1, 2002. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases, for ammonia, at this facility.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan that covers those designated actions that must be taken to ensure employee safety from fire, chemical spills, and other emergencies including the following:\n\n\u00b7 Emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments;\n\u00b7 Procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate;\n\u00b7 Procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed;\n\u00b7 Rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perform them and procedures/facilities for off-site emergency medical care;\n\u00b7 The preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies;\n\u00b7 Names of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under the plan;\n\u00b7 Designation and training of a sufficient number of persons to assist in the safe and orderly evacuation of employees;\n\u00b7 Plan review with each employee on initial assignment, whenever the employee's responsibilities under the plan change, and whenever the plan is changed;\n\u00b7 Housekeeping procedures to control accumulations of flammable and combustible waste materials and residues;\n\u00b7 Regular and proper maintenance of systems installed on heat p"

For example, in the event of an ammonia system leak, an emergency action plan has been developed. The preventive maintenance program addresses scheduled maintenance for fittings, piping, pressure relief valves or other instrumentation. There are numerous other examples of safety improvements that will result from the PHA.  These include:\n\n1. Fully developed Emergency Action Plan. (Implemented, May 2002)\n\n2. Accurate labeling of valves and piping. (To be implemented in 2002)\n\n3. Written Operating Procedures. (Implemented, May 2002)\n\n4. Preventive Maintenance Procedures. (Implemented, May 2002)\n\n5.
