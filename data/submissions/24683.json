The only two chemicals present above threshold levels are chlorine and sulphur dioxide. The total volume on-site is 8,000 lbs of chlorine and 12,000 lbs of sulphur dioxide.\n\n- The City of Ashland has accidental release and emergency response policies in place at the WWTP. As detailed in Section 9, the WWTP is part of the county-wide Disaster and Emergency Services (DES) group which has a plan for an accidental chlorine or sulphur dioxide release. This includes staging locations, emergency measures and public communications plans.\n\n- The WWTP treats the sanitary waste form the city's residents, businesses and industries. Chlorine is used as part of the disinfection process and sulphur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the wastewater prior to discharge back into receiving streams.\n\n - The worst case chlorine release involves a 10 minute release of a one ton chlorine cylinder. Under this scenario, chlorine could travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a health hazard. Up to 3,000 residents live within this area.\n\n- The WWTP has taken pro-active steps to prevent an accidental chlorine release. Operators have gone through emergency management training and regular maintenance is performed on the equipment. In addition, the chlorine isfed by vacuum. if the vacuum is broken, chlorine will not leak unless the vessel is ruptured.\n\n- As detailed previously, the W WTP emergency response program is coordinated with the county-wide plan. Initial ER is provided by the Ashland Fire Department and the communication plan includes coordination with local television and radio stations as well as door-to-door contact of residents in the affected area.\n\n- The city is reviewing the continued use of chlorine as a disinfectant. An emergency scrubber may be installed in the next few years to alleviate the risk management concerns of the gas. New equipment will also be installed in the"
