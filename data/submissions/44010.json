This rail storage yard is enclosed with perimeter fencing and is inspected 4 times per shift by Olin security. This rail yard is used to hold railcars for shipment and is controlled by the Olin Niagara Plant.\n\nMaintaining open, positive relationships with the communities is a priority at Olin.  We understand that we are an integral part of the community.  We support the Olin Community Advisory Panel which was formed in the early 1990's and is comprised of community members who represent near neighbors, business, and education.  Quarterly, members gather with plant management to share information on topics of mutual interests.  \n\nMany items we use every day depend on the products manufactured at the Olin Niagara Falls Plant.  Our primary products, chlorine and caustic soda, are used to make everything from paper products, textiles, water treatment, household bleach, pharmaceuticals, vinyl products and household goods.\n\nOlin has a safety and environmental program which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable.    Our goal is Zero incidents.  To help insure that an emergency situation with off-site implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety and environmental protection in place: Employees, Mechanical Integrity, Process Hazard Review, Process Controls, Safety Systems, and Emergency Preparedness.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Olin Niagara, we are committed to maintaining our railroad storage yard in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overvie"

At Foote Yard, we store the following chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: \n\nToxics\n\nChlorine is stored in railcars awaiting assignment to customers.\n\nCaustic, HCl (< 37%) and Sulfuric Acid, non RMP chemicals, are also periodically stored in Foote Yard awaiting shipping orders.  On occasion we will also store empty Chlorine, Caustic or HCl cars at the facility. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help up effective manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our storage of this chemical.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nPreventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals is our culture.  Foote Yard is a storage yard only with no operations.  Our management systems address successful prevention programs including:\n\n*  Process Hazard Analysis\n*  Training\n*  Management of Change\n*  Compliance Audits\n*  Incident Investigation\n*  Hot Work Permit\n*  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nHazard Reviews:\nConducted all systems handling hazardous materials, as well as on all new designs prior to operation.

      "SummaryText": "e an incident occurs.\n\nEmergency Response:\nThe key to minimizing the effect of an accidental release is to get the right people and equipment to the scene quickly, including both on-site and off-site emergency responders.  Olin Niagara maintains our own response team, Olin Corporation Emergency Action Network (OCEAN) and equipment to minimize response time.  We also work in conjunction with the Niagara Falls Fire Department and the Niagara County L.E.P.C. to respond to any off site releases.\n\nSecurity:\nThe Foote Yard is protected by Security Patrol.  The security at the facility has been reviewed by local police agencies and representatives from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the Foote Yard.  During the past five year, we have had no off-site accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule.\n\nIf such an incident should occur, a formal incident investigation would be conducted to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an emergency response plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Niagara Falls Fire Department and the Niagara County Local Emergency Planning Commission."
