The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released wuold be 150,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design starnards.  The distance to the end point 2.4 miles.\n\n     b.  The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint  is 0.8 miles.\n\n4.
