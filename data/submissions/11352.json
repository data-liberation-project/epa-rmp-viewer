These anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are empty 10 months out of the year due to the planting season in our area. Because of the drop in usage of anhydrous ammonia for fertilizer in the past years we are considering discounting the use of this storage facility and sale of anhydrous ammonia at the end of this year. A decision will be made concerning this matter in December of 1999. Because the tank is not purged and contains tank pressure we are not filing predictively, but these tanks are expected to be taken out of service sometime in the year 2000. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThese storage tanks are located 2.9 miles west of Schalter MS on County Road 450 just north of State Hwy 442. It consist of (8) eight 30,000-gallon storage tanks, which are empty 10 months out of the year, and the associated piping, control valves, pump and motor and a loading and unloading bulk head. It is used to fill 250 gallon and 500 gallon farm tanks with anhydrous ammonia for use as fertilizer for local cotton, soybean, corn and misc. crops. The storage tanks are fenced and locked when not in use. This storage facility meets or exceeds all local and federal installation and safety regulations as required by the state of Mississippi and EPA, OSHA, DOT and NFPA.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE and ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\nThrough our company policies on safety training, equipment inspection and maintenance,\nfacility security, and regulatory compliance it is our belief that safety and prevention remain at\na high level throughout the year. In the event of an emergency or incident our company Emergency Response Policy and Plan requires employees to contact the Leflore County Fire Department, the Leflore County Emergency Response Team, the MS Highway Patrol, and the County Sheriff Department.

      "SummaryText": " Farmers Supply Coop are assigned the duty of contacting and evacuating all public receptors. Additional incident notification is made to Chemtrec the MS Emergency Response Network and the MS Department of Environmental Quality. \n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe worst case scenario would be a failure in a tank weld developing a hole in one tank and involving leakage from additional tanks or piping. This would release approximately 10,000lbs of product at the rate of 10lbs per minute creating a toxic vapor cloud that would extend off site. There are public receptors (homes and a prison) that would be involved in a worst case scenario that would require evacuation. Depending on ambient temperature this vapor cloud would dissipate to safe levels within 4 to 8 hours. In the case of a alternative release, like a hose rupture or bursting pipe, a vapor cloud would still extend off site and involve public receptors. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION PLAN\nThis facility is in compliance with all state and federal regulations and safety requirements. It is maintained in accordance with regulations and our company policies that exceed those requirements. Valve locks and a locked perimeter fence are used to deter vandalism along with area lighting and weekly site inspections. Employee training of specific product handling procedures are provided annually and discussed in monthly company safety meetings. Our emergency response notification is explained above.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has never been an accident or release at this facility that caused injuries, deaths, property damage or evacuations. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAgain these tanks are not used (10) months out of the year and currently contain nothing but vapor pressure at present. A change to our company policy will required notification to the local Leflore county fire department if and when product is delivered to this tank. Notificati"
