The worst case senario for \nHydrofluoric Acid 70% was run and the results were 500 pounds of a liquid being released at a rate of 0.3 pounds per minute for one thousand six hundred and sixty seven minutes.  This senario assumed a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class in an urban area.  This senario could affect an area up to one tenth (0.10) of a mile surrounding the facility.  Within that radius the public receptors are residences, there are no schools, hospitals, recreational areas, major commercial, office, or industrial, prison/correctional facilities or environmental receptors within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe alternate release senario also modeled utilizing the EPA's RMP Comp version 1.06.  The results were Hydrofluoric Acid 70% being released at a rate of 0.1 pounds per minute for five thousand minutes.
