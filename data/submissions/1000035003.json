The facility is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule for one flammable substances, hydrogen. The hydrogen is used in various furnaces to provide an inert atmosphere during heating of tungsten and molybdenum.  Hydrogen is not subject to OSHA's PSM standard as determined by Section2, subpart iii of 1910.119 because the Praxair owned and operated hydrogen storage is defined as a 'normally unoccupied remote facility.' Elmet Technologies Inc does not have any toxic substances covered by OSHA's PSM standard or EPA's RMP rule.\n\n\n\nLiquid hydrogen is stored behind the facility in two above-ground storage tanks, each having a capacity of 10,150 pounds of liquid hydrogen.  A vaporizing system located next to the storage tanks converts the liquid hydrogen to a gas before it is distributed throughout the building for use in furnaces. Elmet leases the outdoor hydrogen storage and delivery equipment from Praxair, Inc. of Danbury, Connecticut. Praxair is responsible for operation and maintenance of the outdoor hydrogen equipment, and provides the hydrogen supply through regular delivery by tank truck. Praxair implements its own safety procedures for Elmet's hydrogen system, including periodic equipment inspections and driver training.  Elmet has discharge detection devices and emergency warning systems within the facility such that the central alarm would sound in the event of a hydrogen release.  These systems are inspected annually.\n\n  \n\nThere have been no serious accidents involving hydrogen in the last five years of operation at the site.  As part of Elmet's emergency response plan, the facility has developed procedures for notifying the public and providing instructions on what to do in the event of an emergency.  As described in our Integrated Contingency Plan, the facility's supervisors and Environmental Coordinators are responsible tor respondi"
