If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is a fertilizer manufacturing facility. We use anhydrous ammonia as an ingredient in the production of fertilizer. We store anhydrous ammonia in an above-ground storage bullet that has a maximum capacity of 14,057 gallons.\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario: Our worst-case scenario is the simultaneous failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank and an unloading railcar, and the release of the entire contents of both containers to the atmosphere within 10 minutes. According to EPA's Guidance for ammonia releases, the worst-case distance to the end-point is 5.6 miles. We estimate a total population of approximately 200,000 within the worst-case distance to the end-point.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario: Our alternative release scenario is the opening of the relief valve on the ammonia storage bullet.  This could happen due to the overfilling of the bullet during unloading operations. In compliance with ANSI K-61.1-1989 safety standards, our administrative policy is to store up to 85% of the maximum capacity in the storage bullet. The EPA's Guidance for ammonia releases lists the alternative-case distance to the toxic endpoint concentration as 0.25 miles. There are no residences within this distance to the end-point.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and m"

Members of the Office of Emergency Services have inspected our anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None."
