If an emerency involving formaldehyde were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Scottsville Fire Department if outside assistance is necessary.               \n\nFacility Description & Regulated Substance:\nThis facility manufactures textile material which is supplied to other facilities for use in tire manufacturing.  Formaldehyde (37% solution) is an ingredient in a textile treatment dip solution which is applied to a woven fabric.  The formaldehyde process consists of one 5,000 gallon storage tank and associated equipment, which are located inside the manufacturing building.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:\nOur worst-case scenario is the release of the entire formaldehyde storage container.  In this scenario, the release would be mitigated by both diking and the building.  Using EPA's RMP Comp program we determined that under these conditions, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.1 miles.  Since the toxic endpoint distance is very limited due to the preventive measures that have been installed, even this worst-case scenario would not affect nearby public receptors. (Please note: Due to a problem with the RMP Submit software, the actual release rate of 0.02 could not be reported as such.  Instead a default of 0.2 was recorded.)\n\nPrevention Program:\nThis facility complies with EPA's Risk Management rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  Additionally, the storage tank and process are located inside the building to prevent releases to the environment.  The process is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA's PSM and good engineering practices.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nWe have never had an accident involving formaldehyde that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in plac"
