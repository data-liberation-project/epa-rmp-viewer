Applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed . The facility's emergency policy involves the preparation of plans tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nThe facility spill prevention policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated flammable substances. In the event such a release occurs facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nHANDLED\n\nThe Foundation Creek gas plant, located in rural Rio Blanco County, CO. operates processes to recover petroleum products ( e.g. natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) from field gas. The NGL separated from the field gas is stored on site and is sold to others for further processing. NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables ethane, propane, butane isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. This facility was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's)\nrisk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses the\nOSHA PSM elements and the management system in place to implement the accident prevention\nprogram.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployees are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management "

Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention\nprogram.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are\ndescribed in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n A variety of technical documents are kept at the gas plant and used to help maintain safe operation of\nthe processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key\nprocess parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration infor\nmation. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee\nparticipation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment\nconsiderations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by\ndocuments that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with\nthe inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented\nsafety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The gas\nplant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring\ninstruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown\nsystems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and\nconstruction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined \nto identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe What If analysis technique is primarily used to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are \nconducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as\nengineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident\nprevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or\nmitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and division management for resolution. Implementation of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA\nteam.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completed.  \nThe final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly\nfrom the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard \nanalysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted \nat this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

The procedures are kept \ncurrent and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management \nof change process.  These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other\npersonnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the gas plant has a training program for\nall employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant\noperations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this\ntraining, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. \nAfter operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to\nperform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition,\nall operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills\nand knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing\ncontractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3)\nemergency plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices before their beginning work.  In addition, the gas plant              evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant\n personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their \nsafety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that requires a change \nin the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to make sure that safety features,\nprocedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the\nequipment into service.
