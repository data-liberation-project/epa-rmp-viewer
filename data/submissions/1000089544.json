An internal BASF database is reviewed as well as all environmental records that require notification to verify the release history.\r\n\r\n5.0  Emergency Response Program\r\nBASF Attapulgus has an onsite emergency response capable of responding to an ammonia release emergency. BASF trained personnel serve as first responders and will contact offsite emergency responders, Decatur County Emergency Management Agency and Decatur County Fire Department, for assistance in the event of an ammonia release emergency.  In the event of a non-emergency ammonia release, BASF employees trained in the safe operation of the ammonia system will close automatic and manual shutoff valves to terminate the flow of ammonia.  BASF and Decatur County officials meet on an annual schedule to review the emergency response program and provide each group with updates of any nature that may affect the response team. \r\n\r\n6.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nBASF has made the following improvements to the safety of its ammonia system (past 5 years):\r\n\u00bf\tInstalled additional ammonia monitors within the facility for detection of possible leaks\r\n\r\nPlanned improvements include:\r\n\u00bf\tReview of possible alternative chemical processes to reduce use of anhydrous ammonia"

BASF's objective is to minimize the risk of a release of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and, if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to BASF's employees, the public, and the  environment.  BASF adheres to general good operating practices, providing appropriate training to all employees, complying with pertinent codes and regulations, and proactively planning and coordinating emergency response activities with BASF's local emergency response providers.  BASF's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\r\n\r\n2.0  Facility Description\r\nBASF manufactures petroleum catalysts, including fluid cracking and moving bed catalysts, for sale to oil refineries. As part of this process, BASF uses anhydrous ammonia for pH control in various applications in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Ammonia is delivered to the facility via tank truck.  The Attapulgus Site has one 12,000-gal ammonia storage tank containing up to about 52,000 lbs. of ammonia.\r\n\r\n3.0  General Chemical Accident Prevention Program and Ammonia-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nBASF Attapulgus is governed by a set of OSHA and EPA (and corresponding Georgia) regulations that requiring measures to prevent a release of hazardous materials.  These rules also require the facility to minimize the consequences of an accidental release to the facility's employees, the public, and the environment. Some of these OSHA and EPA regulations include:\r\n\r\n29 CFR Part 1910.120, 1910.38, 1910.165"

It is also the site's policy to inspect, test, and maintain its process equipment in a manner consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and  recognized good engineering practices. BASF has ammonia-related maintenance procedures addressing preventative maintenance and repairs, hot work permits, etc. designed to prevent accidental ammonia releases. Maintenance mechanics and technicians receive appropriate training in these procedures to ensure that they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties. In addition, the Attapulgus Site has a contractor program to ensure that all outside contractors are familiar with and meet or exceed all site safety standards and practices.\r\n\r\n3.3.  Management of Change and Pre-Startup Review Processes\r\nBASF has Management of Change (MOC) and Pre- Startup Review processes in place to ensure that safety and health considerations and procedural and training requirements are addressed in conjunction with any change being implemented.  The Attapulgus site utilizes a company wide database that tracks MOC notifications and assignments to individuals and teams to properly and timely implement any required changes to the operations.\r\n\r\n3.4.  Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations\r\nBASF conducts routine audits of its ammonia accident prevention program to ensure the program's effectiveness and identify continuous improvement opportunities. In the event an ammonia release occurs or a near miss is identified, BASF has an Incident Investigation and an Emergency Response Team trained to quickly identify root causes and appropriate actions to prevent future releases. These investigations are reviewed to further manage the safety of BASF's manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\n3.5.  Employee Participation\r\nAn"
