Six (6) chemicals exceed the RMP Threshold Quantity (TQ).  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Evonik manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operation procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER Standard.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe facility handles six (6) regulated substances above threshold quantities subject to the RMP regulation.  Acrylonitrile, Formaldehyde (solution), Propylene Oxide, and Ethylenediamine are on the RMP rule toxic chemicals list; Dimethylamine and Trimethylamine are on the flammable chemicals list.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture of specialty chemicals.  These specialty chemicals are used by our customers in a variety of applications.  Raw materials are received at our plant by railcar, bulk tank truck, and other containers to be used as feedstock.  Products are shipped to customers via railcar, tank truck, tote bins or drums"

The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility has developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.    Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving releases of toxics or flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental Damage.\n\n5.    The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER Standard.  All employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  Emergency responders are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level and receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Additionally, the site has designated emergency coordinators that will execute the site emergency plan while providing general plant operations information to community responders.  In addition, emergency drills are conducted periodically.\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendation from Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs) and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and/or operating procedures to improve safety.\n\n"
