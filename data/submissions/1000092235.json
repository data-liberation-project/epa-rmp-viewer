By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community along with the surrounding environment. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety/control devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Nashville Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into blend-grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via an injection skid and analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) fusible elements(fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices.
