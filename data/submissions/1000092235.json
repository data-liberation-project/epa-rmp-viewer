The Nashville Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Nashville, TN. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nBlanchard - Nashville Terminal in Nashville, TN is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Blanchard believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Nashville Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. Blanchard promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Blanchard has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\n\nC.

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community along with the surrounding environment. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety/control devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Nashville Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into blend-grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via an injection skid and analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) fusible elements(fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Nashville Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\n\nPREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nBlanchard's accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to its employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA "

Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, the company and its employees also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control, quickly detect, and minimize the consequence of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures include:\n\n\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams;\n\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators along with 24/7 remote monitoring;\n\n-Computerized monitoring and control of process operation;\n\n-Redundant control systems with UPS;\n\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety devices;\n\n-Limited facility access;\n\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\n\n\nGenera"
