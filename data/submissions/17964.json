LWTP is a small facility and only one person, the Water/Wastewater Superintendent, is responsible for the RMP.  The Water/Wastewater Superintendent is responsible to implement and integrate the RMP and ensure that it is communicated to everyone involved with LWTP operations. \n                                                                                                                                                                  Prevention Program\n\nThe LWTP prevention program is aimed to prevent accidental chlorine releases that could harm employees, the public, and the environment.  This prevention program consists of the following sections:\n\nSafety Information-includes documentation of MSDS sheets, equipment specifications, codes and standards used to build, design, and operate the facility, safe upper and lower parameters in the chlorination system (such as temperature and pressure), and maximum intended inventory of chlorine.  The safety information will be updated when there is a change in any of the above information. This information ensures that LWTP is aware of the safety-related aspects of the chlorination process.\n\nHazard Review-includes a checklist and What-If questions. There are over 60 questions on the checklist and over 20 What-If questions.  The hazard review will be conducted once every five years or when there is a major change in the chlorination process. These questions and checklist help identify hazards and safety deficiencies at"

These procedures include performing equipment inspections, consequences for deviations from the procedures, and safety precautions.  The operating procedures will be updated when there is a change in any of the procedures. \n\nTraining-includes reviewing all the employees training records, determining who needs specific training, providing training for those without proper training, and providing refresher training. Training will be provided on an on-going basis with refresher training on the RMP at least once every three years. \n\nMaintenance-includes reviewing the maintenance requirements for the equipment, ensuring that all of the preventative maintenance is performed, and ensuring that only qualified contractors maintain the equipment.  A qualified outside contractor will perform a biannual inspection that includes testing of all the equipment in the chlorination process. \n\nCompliance Audits-includes performing an audit to evaluate the effectiveness of the prevention program.  An audit of the prevention program will be performed at least once every three years.  \n\nIncident Investigations-includes performing investigations for all incidents that could have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine.  These incident investigations will determine the cause of the accident, the contributing factors, and ways to improve the safety of the operation.     \n\nRecommendations-includes those items that will improve the safety of the plant operations.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe Lockhart Water Treatment Plant (LWTP) produces approximately 1.5 million gallons of potable water each day for the City of Lockhart.  The plant uses approximately 60 pounds/day of chlorine gas to purify the water.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists chlorine as a toxic substance that is potentially harmful to humans and the environment.  LWTP stores 4000 pounds of chlorine, liquefied under pressure, in (2) 1-Ton Cylinders.  The EPA requires the plant to have a Risk Management Program (RMP) because there is more than 2500 pounds of chlorine in storage.  \n\nThe City of Lockhart, like the EPA, are committed to chemical safety and thus created a RMP.  This commitment starts with the Water/Wastewater Superintendent and includes all of the Plant Operators.  The purpose of the RMP is to prevent any accidental releases of chlorine gas and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The Water/Wastewater Superintendent of Lockhart is responsible for the implementation and integration of the RMP.\n\nThe RMP consists of the following:\n7 A worst case scenario giving the radius and population around the plant that could be exposed to high concentrations of chlorine gas.   \n7 One alternative case scenario that is more realistic than the worst case scenario. \n7 Five-year accident history detailing LWTP's accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five years.  \n7 Management System for implementing and integrating the RMP.\n7 Prevention Program detailing safety information, the hazard review process, operating procedures, training, equipment maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n7 Emergency Response Program detailing emergency response procedures and accident investigation and reporting.\n7 Planned Actions to Improve Safety at LWTP."

      "SummaryText": "Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe largest quantity of chlorine released is assumed to be 2000 pounds (a 1-Ton chlorine cylinder) in 10 minutes.  The toxic zone around the plant is 1.3 miles with an estimated population of 170 (according to the Census Bureau).  The toxic zone is the area around the plant with an airborne concentration of chlorine gas above 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm), which is harmful to humans and environment. \n\nThe model used to generate the toxic zone is from EPA regulations, 40 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 68.22 and program entitled RMP Comp.  The model parameters, stated in 40 CFR 68.22, are reasonable and consistent with LWTP.  The model assumes the atmosphere to be very stable causing a chlorine release to remain relatively stagnant in the air.  \n                                                                                                                                                                  Alternative Case Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes that one of the valves is broken off the chlorine cylinder resulting in a 1 diameter hole.  This scenario assumes 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine (a 1-Ton chlorine cylinder) are released at a rate of 2500 pounds/min.  This rate is given in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants 40 CFR Part 68 for a liquid chlorine release through a 1 diameter hole.  The release occurs in less than a minute and results in a 0.7 mile toxic radius around the plant.  The toxic zone has an estimated population of 50 (according to the U.S. Census Bureau).  \n\nThe model for this scenario is the same as in the worst case scenario.  This model is reasonable to assume because one of the valves can be broken off, which would result in a 1 diameter hole in the cylinder.\n                                                                                                                                                                       Five-Year"

The last part of the ERP is the investigation of an accident.  The investigation will determine the primary and secondary causes and necessary actions to prevent other accidents.

LWTP is in the process of making the following changes:\n7 Implementing daily checks of chlorination system for all shifts.\n7 Installing a bunker around the chlorine cylinders to prevent human or vehicle impact.\n7 Posting hazardous material / warning signs outside the chlorinator room and at the chlorine storage area. \n7 Thoroughly training all employees in emergency response procedures and evacuation      route.\n7 Installing a windsock that gives wind speed and direction on a digital display.\n7 Posting emergency exit signs. \nThe operators of LWTP will continue to improve the Risk Management Program as well as all the safety-related aspects of the chlorination system at the plant."
