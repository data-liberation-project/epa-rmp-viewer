Toxic substances used or stored at PP do not meet or exceed the listed threshold quantities.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the PP. Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM"

PP consults with employees on the conduct and development of Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) and the development of the elements of OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety management (PSM) standard. Employees have access to all information created as part of PP's PSM and accident prevention programs.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nPP completes a compilation of written Process Safety Information before conducting any PHA required by the OSHA PSM standard. The compilation of written process safety information is to enable PP and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals. This Process Safety Information includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, to the technology of the process, and to the equipment in the process.\nInformation pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process consists of the following:\na.\tToxicity information;\nb.\tPermissible exposure limits;\nc.\tPhysical data;\nd.\tReactivity data;\ne.\tCorrosivity data;\nf.\tThermal and chemical stability data; and,\ng.\tHazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foresee ably occur.\nThe above chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is normally provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\nInformation pertaining to the technology of the process includes the following:\na.\tProcess chemistry;\nb.\tMaximum intended inventory;\nc.\tSafety upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressure, flows or compositions; and,\nd.\tAn evaluation of the consequences of deviation, inc"

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards involved.\nPP uses one or more of the appropriate analysis techniques to perform the PHA evaluations. The PHA evaluations are performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, and the team includes at least one employee who has experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated. Also, one member of the team must be knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology being used. The PHA evaluations address:\na.\tThe hazards of the process;\nb.\tThe identification of any previous incident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences in the workplace;\nc.\tEngineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships; such as\nappropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases. Acceptable detection\nmethods might include process monitoring and control instrumentation with alarms and detection hardware\nsuch as hydrocarbon sensors;\nd.\tConsequences of failure of Engineering and administrative controls;\ne.\tFacility siting;\nf.\tHuman factors; and,\ng.\tA qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on employees in the workplace.\nPP has established a system to promptly address the team findings and recommendations; as"

      "SummaryText": "LDEQ Facility ID 30922\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nPinnacle Polymers, LLC (PP) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for PP workers, the public, and the environment. It is PP's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. As part of this policy, PP has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at PP and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:lll, Chapter 59). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at PP. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at PP.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nPP is committed to the safety of the general public and PP employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases hazardous substances in and around the facility. PP utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has an emergency response team trained to contain, mitigate, monitor and stop the release.   Additionally, the emergency response team is fully staffed and trained for fire fighting, and other emergency situations such as natural disasters and bomb threats. In addition to ha"
