Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe City of Sauk Rapids, MN Water Treatment Plant uses the chemical chlorine for the purpose of disinfection of the city wastewater effluent. Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The City of Sauk Rapids is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine storage and feed processes at our facility. It is our policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends on the safe handling procedures that we use combined with the safety devices included in the design of this facility and the training of our personnel.\n\nIf a release of chlorine should occur, we are coordinated with the Sauk Rapids Emergency dispatcher and in turn the Sauk Rapids Fire Department and Emergency Operations Coordinator, who will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of an unforeseen release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Sauk Rapids, MN Water Treatment Plant has one regulated substance, chlorine, at the facility. Chlorine, a toxic gas stored under pressure as a liquid, is used for disinfection of the city's wastewater effluent. \n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility at any time is two - 2,000 pound (1-ton) tanks, for a total of 4,000 pounds (2-tons). However, a minimum supply of chlorine is kept on hand. A second full tank is ordered when the active tank is approximately one quarter full.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo evaluate the worst-case scena"

      "SummaryText": "rio, we have used EPAA?s RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants and RMP*Comp, ver 1.07. For alternative release scenario analysis, the release rate was estimated by The Chlorine Institute, Inc. using the SAFER/TRACER model, Pamphlet 74, Edition 3, April 1998. The distance to endpoint is based on EPAA?s RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants, Exhibit 4-12.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest chlorine storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor in an outdoor setting within 10 minutes of tank failure. An urban setting was chosen as the topographical setting. Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles corresponding to an endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm (volume/volume) is reached. The endpoint basis is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2), developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - An outdoor release of gas due to valve failure was considered for the alternative release scenario. It is assumed that mitigation occurs within one hour of the start of the release under neutral weather conditions. As in the worst-case scenario, an urban topographical setting was chosen. \n\nThe maximum distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm (v/v) is 0.1 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Sauk Rapids, MN Water Treatment Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in 40 CFR part 68. The Plant is also in compliance with OSHAA?s Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Rule as specified in 29 CFR 1910.119. The chlorine cylinders are handled minimally outside of the facility and are stored indoors. Add"

      "SummaryText": "itionally, a vacuum demand chlorine delivery system automatically stops the flow of chlorine if a piping or valve failure causes a vacuum loss. Water Treatment plant operators are competent in the chlorine system operations and are trained in the hazards and operating procedures associated with the chlorine processes.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nThe Sauk Rapids, MN Water Treatment Plant began construction in August 2002 and went on-line in December 2003.  Since going on-line, no documented accidental releases have occurred.   \n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nEmergency Response by the Sauk Rapids, MN Water Treatment Plant employees will be limited to incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the City of Sauk Rapids Fire Department and the emergency dispatcher. The Water Treatment PlantA?s Emergency Response Plan is studied, practiced, and updated as needed. "
