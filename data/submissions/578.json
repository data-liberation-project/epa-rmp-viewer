The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of Beason Ag Center are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with that material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n2. Facility Information: A primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia to be used in the conversion process of mixed liquid fetilizers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used in mixed liquid fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 85,000 pounds in the facilitys 1 tank. \n3. The worst- case release scenario would be a release of the total contents of the largest trailer released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 85,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .67 miles.\nThe alternate-case release scenario anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be a release from a rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, withl 1,9W pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is..60 miles.\nThe alternate-case release scenario for Aqua ammonia is assumed to be a release from a rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with  pounds released over  2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is miles.\n4. The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by "
