      "SummaryText": "This RMP was updated in accordance with 40CFR Part 68 guidelines.  The anniversary date is 12/15/2004.  The program covers anhydrous ammonia (ammonia).  Ammonia is utilized at the facility as a refrigerant and a maximum of approximately 6,000 lbs. are on-site at anytime.  This quantity is above the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold quantity of 500 lbs. and dictates that Kagome Inc. complete a Program 2 Prevention Program.  The Kagome Inc. RMP document has been prepared in accordance with CalARP Regulations for Program 2 facilities and with local requirements prescribed by Merced County.  The worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases for ammonia was assembled and modeled.  The scenarios are:\n\nWorst-Case:  Release of entire system contents in a 10-minute period.\nAlternative-Case:  Release of entire system contents in a 30-minute period.\n\nKagome Inc. has an active training schedule for implementing measures to prevent and mitigate the effects and limit the distances for the reported scenarios.  The risk reduction measures include:  written operating procedures, training, securing the ammonia area, maintenance procedures, and updating the P&ID's.\n\nKagome Inc. has not had a reportable accidental release in the past five years.\n\nKagome Inc. has a written Emergency Response Program that includes specific actions to be taken by facility employees in response to an accidental release of ammonia.  The facility has personnel trained in emergency response.  The ER Plan includes procedures for coordinating with local agencies responding to accidental released and informing the public."
