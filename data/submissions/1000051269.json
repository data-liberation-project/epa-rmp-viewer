The program includes equipment monitoring, regular inspections and maintenance, and log keeping of (1) operating conditions, (2) scheduled maintenance, (3) emergency response, and (4) operator training.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration-operation system has specific safety measures in place to prevent accidental release. All pressure relief valves for the fixed system are tied in with diffusion tanks to mitigate a high pressure release incident. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.\n A thorough examination of the system that included a \"What If\" hazard analysis, was performed in accordance with update requirements.\n\nSafety and equipment operational training will be conducted at a minimum at least once a year. Training topics will include (1) equipment operational procedures, (2) emergency response procedures, (3) a review of the Risk Management Plan, (4) a review of the Business Response Plan, and (5) evacuation procedures. \n\nRefrigeration equipment will be inspected and reviewed regularly and as new equipment becomes operational onsite.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTaylor Farms California conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTaylor Farms California uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. \n\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage and produce pre-cooling, chilled water generation and produce processing. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporative cooling coils surge drums, plate frame type water chillers, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. Portable systems are screw & reciprocating type compressor skids, three vacuum cooling systems, two high side trailers and falling film water chillers. Each vacuum cooling syst"

Each high side trailer contains one screw compressor, evaporative condenser and a high pressure receiver. \n\nThree vacuum cooling systems operate as stand alone systems while high side trailers and falling film water chillers operate connected to main systems. All of the vacuum cooling systems, one high side trailer and the water chillers are removed from the facility at the end of each season\n\nFacility operates seasonally from approximately November 15 through April 15. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the high pressure receiver during the off season. All of the refrigeration system equipment except the cold room evaporators are located outdoors. Facility has no mechanical room hausing the refrigeration equipment. \n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming. There are assigned responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 48,600 lb \n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentration"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaylor Farms California maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is an Incident Investigation program in place to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future releases.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. All of the relief valves at the facility and the vacuum cooling systems are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Taylor Farms California personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. \n\n\n\n6.
