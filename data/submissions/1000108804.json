We regularly coordinate emergency response with the Fire Department and regional emergency planning and management agencies. The Integrated Contingency Plan identifies emergency responder notification procedures in the event that a release escapes our containment systems. Our plans comply with the emergency response requirements of OSHA, EPA and PADEP. We regularly train on the hazards, emergency awareness and procedures and conduct notification exercises to maintain our effectiveness.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe facility became owned by a private company in July 2023 and upgraded from Prevention Program 2 to Program 3, adding new procedures and practices.  We continually work to safely manage chemical hazards to protect our employees and the community we serve. Each year we will review procedures, maintain equipment, follow safe work practices and coordinate with community emergency responders. Periodically, we will audit our program, update our Process Hazard Analysis and implement any additional improvements recommended by these evaluations. Based on our most recent evaluations, new key fob security system and continuous monitoring of unauthorized entry and video feeds will be implemented. We continue this process on an ongoing basis."

The company is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees. The Corporate Mission is to continue in a leadership role as a good corporate citizen and encourage employees' active participation in the communities served. The WTP conducts a safe, productive business, contributing to the community while minimizing risk to employees and neighbors.\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\nThe plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent to provide safe drinking water. We are careful to understand the hazards and safely manage it. Our policies and programs call for preventing accidental releases, mitigating them on-site and being prepared in the event of an emergency to minimize the effects on employees and the public. To ensure that a chemical release does not occur, the Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program encompassing the twelve elements of both EPA RMP and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. A management Team, consisting of qualified management personnel located onsite and at Corporate Headquarters, is accountable for implementation, enforcement and oversight of the above elements of the release prevention program. In addition to prevention programs, chemical-specific prevention steps include:\n> Vacuum regulators mounted directly on the containers that automatically shut down the chemical flow if there is a leak on piping or equipment.\n> Leak detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems.\n> An automatic dial out system activated by a leak alarm and designed to mobilize staff for assessment and response.\n> Chlorine is stored in an enclosed room in a building constructed of non-combustible materials (concrete block, fire doors, etc.). \nFive-Year Accident History\nAs an indication of the effectiveness of t"
