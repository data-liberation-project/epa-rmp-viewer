This rule is otherwise known as the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) (40 CFR part 68). The rule requires that each affected business develop and implement a Risk Management Program. The goal of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of toxic or flammable substances that can cause serious harm to the public health and the environment and to mitigate the effects of releases that do occur. It will ensure that responders and the citizens of Colstrip are aware of any hazards associated with an emergency at the Colstrip Water Treatment Plant.\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONCE POLICY\n\n\u00b7\tIN AUGUST 1998, A PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN WAS WRITTEN AND ADOPTED. \no\tThe purpose is to establish normal procedures for handling hazardous chemicals that are regulated by the Occupation Safety and Health Administration.  This procedure has been written for compliance to 29 CFR 1910.119.\no\tThis procedure identifies what requirements are necessary for the continuous use of chlorine gas as an oxidizing biocide at the Colstrip Water and Wastewater Treatment Plants. \no\tThis procedure applies to all employees that work at the City of Colstrip who operate or support the operation of the Water and Wastewater Plants.\no\tA Copy of the PSMP is kept on file at the Water Treatment Plant and at City Hall.\n\nOUR FACILITY AND THE SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\u00b7\tTHE COLSTRIP WATER TREATMENT PLANT IS LOCATED NORTHWEST OF THE TOWN OF COLSTRIP AT 45 53.39N AND -106 38.02W, JUST EAST OF CASTLE ROCK LAKE. \no\tThe Colstrip Water Treatment Plant is operated by the City of Colstrip and employs state certified water and wastewater operators to install, operate, maintain, and comply with environmental regulations.\no\tReview of existing processes at the Colstrip Water Treatment Plant has identi"

The chlorine is liquefied under pressure and is packaged in the form of two 1 ton cylinders. Chlorine is dangerous as a gas or liquid. Chlorine gas is used in the treatment process as a disinfectant killing greater than 99.99% of all waterborne pathogens. It is also used in the optimization of the filtering process.\no\tChlorine gas irritates the respiratory system, mucous membranes, eyes, and skin.  Breathing air containing high concentrations of chlorine can result in death.  The OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) and the threshold limit value (TLV) are 0.5 ppm. The EPA toxic endpoint is based on 3 ppm. Liquid chlorine can cause skin and eye burns upon contact.  When open to the air, liquid chlorine vaporizes to chlorine gas expanding 460 times when changing from the liquid state to the gaseous state. \no\tProper handling can mitigate the hazards of exposure to chlorine.  Essentially proper handling of chlorine means using operating and maintenance practices which will keep it confined in shipping containers, storage tanks and plant piping.  Chlorine can be dangerous when it escapes to the atmosphere.  Chlorine has a pungent odor and is detectable at very low concentrations (approximately 1 ppm) and initially alerts workers of a potentially dangerous situation.  Employees must be aware that with time people lose their ability to smell chlorine because it numbs the olfactory nerves.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air so the gas will stay close to the ground when dispersed by the wind and it will accumulate in low places.\no\tEmployees whose work includes the operation or maintenance of chlorination equipment must have adequate knowledge of its chemical hazards and be properly trained. \n \n \nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\u00b7\tTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON THE EPA'S RMP*COMP MODEL.\no\tInvolves a vessel leak from a 1-ton cylinder.

Anyone inside this area would need to be evacuated. The area includes everything from just south of Willow Avenue to the power plants on the east to Chisholm street on the north. The industrial park is included as well as is all of the Cimarron area. The estimated population within this area is 1500 people and includes Isabel Bills Elementary School and the Frank Brattin Middle School.
