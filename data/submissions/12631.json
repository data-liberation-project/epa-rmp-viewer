The system provides water for potability, cooling, process, and fire protection needs and is vital to the continuous on-line reliability of the Y-12 and X-10 facilities. Any interruption in continuous water service will have an immediate harmful impact on plant operations.\n\nThe water system is also important to public health and the economic stability of the City of Oak Ridge (OR). The city receives potable water from the DOE/OR water plant for use by domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers.\n\nRaw Water System\nThe raw water supply system starts with raw water from Melton Hill Lake (Clinch River). The River Intake/Pump Station on Pump House Road is located on the southern edge of the City of Oak Ridge, Anderson County, Tennessee. An emergency pump station consisting of two 7,000-gpm pumps is available for pumping water from an inlet cove near the original intake structure. Alternate power source (diesel/generator set) is installed to provide a backup power source.\n\nThe raw water storage tank and booster pump station along Scarboro Road has a capacity of 1.5 MG. Raw water is pumped from the River Intake/Pump Station to the raw water booster storage tank and then to the booster pump station through two parallel mains.\n\nWater Treatment System\nThe Water Treatment Plant is located on Pine Ridge, north of the Y-12 complex, approximately 1/2 of a mile northwest from the intersection of Scarboro and Bear Creek roads. The water plant's current maximum daily production capacity is 28 mill"

Water treatment includes chemical mixing using potassium permanganate and polymers, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection with chlorine. Zinc phosphate is fed as a corrosion inhibitor and fluoride is fed for dental hygiene into the clearwell. Treated water is stored on the plant site in reservoirs with 3 MG and 4 MG capacities .\n\nChlorine, a regulated substance, is used for disinfection purposes in the production of potable water. The approximate daily usage of chlorine is 170 to 350 pounds. Approximately four (4), one-ton containers are stored at the Water Treatment Plant, and two (2), one-ton containers are stored at the River Intake/Pump Station. Two containers are on line at all times. The Water Treatment Plant uses an average of one container per week, and the River Intake/Pump Station uses approximately one container every 12 days; annual chlorine usage is approximately 85,000 pounds.\n\n\nMajor Hazards\n\nChlorine is highly toxic, and gas leaks can pose a health hazard to employees and the public and may possibly interrupt water treatment. Chlorine is an irritant to the eyes, mucous membranes, and skin. Overexposure can cause an irritation in the throat and lungs. Chlorine is about 2.5 times heavier than air. Gaseous chlorine will channel, pool, and pancake in low leveled areas, and it has a high affinity for water.\n\nChlorine is a yellow-greenish gas with a characteristic penetrating and irritating odor. The range of reported odor thresholds for chlorine is 0.03 to 3.5 ppm; however, because of the fatigue of the olfactory glands, the odor does not always serve as an adequate warning of exposure.\n\nChlorine is a nonflammable gas, but it does support combustion due to its oxidational properties. Chlorine gas will react with moisture in the atmosphere to form an acidic and irritating cloud or plume. Chlorine emits toxic fumes as hydrogen chloride gas und"

This scenario was modeled on two, one-ton containers as a direct release over a 10-minute period. The result assumes Stability Class F, a wind speed of 1 meter per second, a temperature of 780 F, and 80% relative humidity. The topography is urban. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 6.91 miles. Within this radius, schools, residences, hospitals, public recreational areas, and commercial, office, and industrial areas exist. This area includes DOE National Environmental Research Park (NERP) reference and natural areas. Reference areas have representative or unique plant communities. Natural areas have rare plant habitats or unique plant communities. The population within the 6.91-mile radius is 40,000. Passive mitigation is that each one-ton container is approximately an inch thick in diameter and is locked inside a concrete building.\n\nThe alternate chlorine release scenario for a one-ton container involves tubing failure, a bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16-inch-diameter valve body opening. This scenario was modeled as a release from a horizontal, cylindrical tank with the release occurring through a short pipe or valve in the top of the tank. The chlorine escapes only as a gas. The total release is 317 pounds over a 60-minute duration period. The result assumes Stability Class D, a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, a temperature of 900 F, and 80% relative humidity. The topography is urban. The distance to the toxic endpoint is .45 miles. Within this radius, residences, public recreational areas, and commercial, office, and industrial areas exist.

Active mitigation includes scrubbers (neutralization), alarms, and emergency shutdown systems, as well as chlorine spill kits. The scrubbing system uses a 25% solution of sodium hydroxide to remove and absorb chlorine fumes from the atmosphere.\n\n\nAccidental Chemical Release Prevention\n\nETMC's operation is critical to DOE's Y-12 Plant, Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL), and the City of Oak Ridge. Therefore, we must ensure that we are well-equipped and prepared to handle any potentially hazardous situation. We engineer safety into our facilities. All of ETMC's hazardous materials accumulation areas are designed with safeguards to prevent a release of hazardous materials in case of an equipment or mechanical failure.\n\nETMC complies with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management, which is a systematic approach to evaluating the entire process from design to use. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and any other elements which impact the process are all considered in the evaluation. Relevant Environmental Safety and Health (ES&H) Manual chapters define the operating procedures for safe chemical usage at ETMC. Policies and procedures are written and implemented in accordance with local, State, and Federal rules and regulations. \n\nETMC has a special work permit checklist/request form which is used for each task performed. If chemicals are used in performance of the task, the ES&H Department performs a hazard analysis to ensure positive control measures are implemented.\n\nPurchasing of chemicals is limited to the minimum quantity required to accomplish the required task, i.e., chlorine is limited to six, one-ton containers on site at any time.

The HAZCOM program makes use of MSDSs labels and training. Employees receive orientation, and formal and specific training for the job they are to perform. HAZCOM refresher training is conducted annually.\n\nChemical handlers receive OSHA-required training such as HAZCOM, HAZWOPER, and fire safety, as well as chemical-specific hazards involved in the work task.\n\nChlorine handling presents the highest risk associated with chemicals at ETMC. The chlorine feed room and storage area is locked, and only authorized personnel are allowed into this area. The area is checked a minimum of three times, once per shift, in a 24-hour period during routine inspections.\n\nChlorine is fed into the water through a \"closed\" system to prevent personnel contact. Operators are required to use a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) while changing containers.
