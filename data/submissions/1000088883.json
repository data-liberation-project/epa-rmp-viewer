(Crestwood), owner and operator of the Cowtown Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Cowtown Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Cowtown Gas Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\n\n\nThe facility is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant that is designed to process natural gas. The Cowtown Gas facility consists of two cryogenic processing plants which combined are designed for 225 MMSCFD. The facility consists of the following: inlet gas separation and filtration, inlet compression, glycol dehydration, mol sieve dehydration units, amine product treating, cryogenic processing units, propane refrigeration system, residue compression, flare system, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. NGLs from the cryogenic units are stored in three 60,000-gallon bullet storage tanks and can be loaded into tanker trucks for shipment or sent offsite via pipeline. Natural gas from residue compression is sent offsite via pipeline. \n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains two s"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility.  \n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Cowtown Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.    Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n\n3.    High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\n4.    Facility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week \n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.    Berms around tanks\n\n2.    Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\n\n3.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n4.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\n\n5.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n2.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n\n3.    SPCC Plan\n\n4.    Fire extinguishers\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Cowtown Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for ex"

In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Cowtown Gas Plant is coordinated with the Hood County LEPC. The Hood County LEPC contact in Mr. Ray Wilson (817) 579-3335.  The Cowtown Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. Crestwood operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Granbury Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Crestwood conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Cowtown Gas Plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substance in the facility.  \n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Cowtown Gas Plant has not had any accidents in the last five years. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Cowtown Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. \n\n"
