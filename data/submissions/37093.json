The water plant serves Trenton's population of over 6200 plus the Public Water Supply District for Grundy county. We are dedicated to supplying quality water and a safe environment to all of our customers and employees.\n\n\nThe Trenton Municipal Utilities water plant is located at 1043 Crowder Road on top of a hill. The water plant's primary activity is to produce an average of 3 million gallons of water per day, with a total capacity of 4.5 million gallons per day. The regulated substance that we use at the water plant is chlorine. The water plant uses about 60 pounds of chlorine a day, and may have up to eight thousand pounds in inventory at any one time.\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been started by Trenton Municipal Utilities to check all equipment valves and pipes on a regular timetable. All employees at the water plant have been trained in safe handling of chlorine tanks.Such training includes loading and unloading supplier shipments, connecting and disconnecting the tanks, and changing equipment in the plant.\n\n\nThere have not been any releases chlorine in the last five years.The main reason for this success is that Trenton Municipal Utilities has a good preventive maintenance program and keeps all emloyees trained in safe handling of chlorine.\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is set up to shut down any leak and to evacuate any part of the public that may be in danger of a release of chlorine gas.Trenton Municipal Utilities will coordinate with the fire department and Local Emergency Planning Coordinator [L.E.P.C.] to help with the shut down of the chlorine system in the case of an emergency.  The D.N.R. and G.S. Robins, our chlorine supplier, would be called for help.The hospital would be notified of any leak so they would know about and be prepared for any medical treatments needed. In case of a chlorine release"
