      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nA) Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nKaiser-Frontier Midstream, LLC's (Kaiser-Frontier) Silo Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, procedures are in place to secure the facility and notify the appropriate response personnel.  The facility does not have a formal response plan, but it is included in the community response plan maintained by the Laramie County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  \n\n\n\nB) Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Silo Gas Plant is located 15 miles northeast of Cheyenne, Wyoming (1 mile south of the intersection of county road 222 and 136), and incorporates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, pentane) from oil and gas wells. The Silo Plant handles methane; ethane, propane, pentane and butane which are regulated flammables. It processes approximately 0.5 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum on-site inventory of NGLs is operationally limited to 75,000 lbs.  Currently there are 2 storage bullets at the facility.  Only one of these is in service at any one time, with a second providing back up storage capacity should the primary vessel need to be removed from service.\n\n\n\nThe Silo Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\n\n\nC) General Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Silo Gas Plant. The process is regulated by the EPA Risk Manage"

      "SummaryText": "ment Program (RMP) regulations.  This summary addresses only general safety issues and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n1) Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nKaiser-Frontier and the Silo Gas Plant have long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include:\n\n\n\na)  A lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on\n\n\n\nb) A procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened\n\n\n\nc) A permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work)\n\n\n\nd) A permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  \n\n\n\nThese procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\n2) Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nKaiser-Frontier's Silo Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigator documents his/her findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Kaiser-Frontier management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\n\n\n\n3) Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Silo Gas Plant periodically conducts audits to determine whether the proced"

The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Silo Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are traced until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\n4) Summary of Process Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe process at the Silo Gas Plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations.  The Silo Gas Plant has safety features to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\na) Release Detection\n\n\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n\n\n\nB) Release Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n\n\n2. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameter (e.g., high level, high temperature, high pressure)\n\n\n\n3. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n\n\n4. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nc) Release Mitigation\n\n\n\n1. Personal protective equipment\n\n\n\n2. Spacing of equipment in accordance with Industrial Risk Insurers spacing guideline\n\n\n\n3. Emergency shutdown strategically placed in the plant to automatically shut in the inlet.\n\n\n\n\n\nD) Off-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage vessel containing 75,000 pounds of a Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) mix. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS was calculated using the RMP*Comp program to be 0.30 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\n\n\nThere are no residences, institutions, or other"

This building is used infrequently (less than 30 minutes per week) by a third party.  Based on the limited use and security maintained this structure is not considered a public receptor.   \n\n\n\nE) Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years the process has not had an accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\n\n\nF) Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Silo Gas Plant is included in the Laramie County (LEPC) community response plan, and therefore does not maintain a formal Emergency Response Plan as defined by OSHA.  The LEPC response plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  In addition, the facility maintains a simple Emergency Action Plan for the site which describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment and provides the contact information for emergency response organizations.  A site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals are kept at the Facility.  The Emergency Action Plan is updated and reviewed as appropriate to reflect changes to the facility and the covered process, and the employees are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Silo Gas Plant is coordinated with the Laramie County Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Silo Gas Plant Manager has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of"
