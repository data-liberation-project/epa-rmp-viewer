      "SummaryText": "1.\tThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nAt the Southtowns Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) - Erie County Southtowns Sewage Treatment Agency (STSTA), personnel are continually concerned with the safety of employees, the public, and the environment.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program mandates operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at this facility.  To prevent possible releases of regulated substances, appropriate controls and techniques are used.  If such a release does occur, personnel at the Southtowns WWTP, through the Division of Sewerage Management (DSM) are coordinated with the Erie County Department of Emergency Services and the Woodlawn Fire Department Inc., whom all commit highly trained emergency response crews to help control and ease the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (primary activities, use of regulated substances, & quantities handled or stored)\n\n\u00b7\tThe Southtowns WWTP\u00bfs primary activity involves the treatment of wastewater.  Presently, there is one (1) regulated toxic substance above threshold quantity at this facility, which is Chlorine (Cl2).  According to the regulations, the Southtowns WWTP is required to comply with the Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n\u00b7\tChlorine is used for the disinfection of wastewater, primarily to destroy and/or deactivate pathogenic organisms.\n\n\u00b7\tThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at this facility is 20,000 lbs., which is broken down into ten (10) one-ton (2,000 lbs.) tanks.  Four (4) tanks are kept on the scale and two (2) tanks are in use at any given time.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario (include scenario & distance to endpoint).\n\nThe ALOHA (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) modeling program, version 5.2.3, w"

      "SummaryText": "as used to attain the required offsite consequence analysis for this facility.  The following provides a summary of the worst case and alternative scenarios:\n\nThe WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a disastrous release from one of the chlorine containers.  In this particular scenario, 2,000 lbs. (the entire mass of the tank) of Chlorine is released in a gaseous form over a ten (10) minute span. Under worst case weather conditions (Class F atmospheric stability, 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), 50% humidity, no cloud cover, and 1.5 m/s (3.35 mph) windspeed), the maximum threat zone distance for a level of concentration (LOC) of 0.0087 mg/L is 2.7 miles.\n \nThe ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO for Chlorine involves a release from a single chlorine container and is assumed to be a failure at the transfer hose, due to over pressurization or human error.  In this scenario, 800 lbs. of Chlorine will be released in a gaseous form over a six (6) minute span. The contents that remain in the tank after the pressurized gas is released will be of liquid chlorine.  This liquid would be at a level lower than the release point and therefore, the contents would remain in the tank.  Under neutral weather conditions (taken from Local Climatological Data 1999-2001 for Buffalo, NY) being Class C stability, 49\u00b0F (9.4\u00b0C), 45% humidity, 5/10 cloud cover, and 9.8 mph (4.38 m/s) windspeed, the maximum threat zone distance for a level of concentration (LOC) of 0.0087 mg/L is 1.7 miles.\n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAt the Southtowns WWTP, personnel have taken all the steps needed to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements found in 40 CFR, Part 68.  This facility is subject to the OSHA PSM, EPCRA section 302, and CAA Title V operating permit standards.  A brief description of the elements in the release prevention program are as follows:\n\nSafety Information\nThis facility keeps a written recor"

The methodology used to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process was the What If/Checklist.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is reviewed and updated (if necessary) and revalidated every five (5) years.  Any changes resulting from the PHA are completed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nTo safely conduct activities involved within the process, the Southtowns WWTP personnel maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address each operating phase including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after an emergency shutdown.  Each year, the Chief WWTP Operator reviews the operating procedures and certifies in the annual report that all current operating practices are reflected.  In addition, all operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the process.\n\nTraining\nThis facility has an extensive training program in place to ensure that employees involved with the processes are completely knowledgeable about the operating procedures and hazards associated with them.  Refresher training is provided at least every (3) three years and more often if necessary, to each employee involved in operating a process.  Currently, training is ongoing throughout the year in many areas.\n \nMechanical Integrity\nAt the Southtowns WWTP, personnel carry out routine maintenance checks, inspections, and testing on all process equipment to ensure proper functioning.

Any employee whose job tasks are affected by a change in the process are informed and trained.\n\nPre-startup Reviews \nPre-startup safety reviews related to modifications in the established process are conducted as needed. These reviews confirm that construction, equipment, safety, operations, and maintenance procedures are in place and adequate prior to startup.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Southtowns WWTP evaluates compliance at least every three (3) years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audit are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDuring the past five (5) years, there have not been any incidents at the Southtowns WWTP.  If and when the occasion arises, any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a disastrous release of a regulated substance would promptly be investigated. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Southtowns WWTP has incorporated any appropriate employee comments into the Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) (Appendix A).  In addition, all employees have access to the information developed under this standard. \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the Southtowns WWTP hires outside contractors to perform maintenance and/or construction work.

Due to effective release prevention, no accidental releases have occurred over the last five (5) years.\n\n\n6.\tThe Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Southtowns WWTP has a written Emergency Response Plan (Appendix C) that deals with accidental releases.  The procedure includes aspects of emergency response including monitoring and detection, notifications following a release, direction and control, containment, evacuations, mutual aid assistance, emergency equipment inventory, first aid, review, updates and training, and other emergencies.  The emergency response equipment is inspected, tested and maintained in accordance with the DSM Respirator Program.  The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually and promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the process.\n\nThe Facility Emergency Coordinators (FEC) for the Southtowns WWTP are: \n\u00b7\tChief WWTP Supervisor, Glenn Absolom\n\u00b7\tAssistant Chief WWTP Supervisor, James Keller\n\u00b7\tChief WWTP Operator, Randy Schweitzer \n\u00b7\tChief WWTP Operator, Jim Balcarczyk \n\u00b7\tChief of Maintenance \u00bf WWTP, Dave Park\nThe Emergency Response Plan (Appendix C) has been coordinated and verified with each FEC.
