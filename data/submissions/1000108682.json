The flammables mixtures may contain varying quantities of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, isobutane, and isopentane. The process includes inlet gas compressors to raise the pressure through the plant, Tri-Ethylene Glycol (TEG) absorption to remove water entrained in the inlet gas, a process skid to extract natural gas liquids, residue compressors to raise the gas pressure from the plant to sales point, and natural gas liquid pumps to push product from the plant to storage tanks where it is loaded onto trucks for sale.\r\n\u000b\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program for Regulated Substances\r\n\u000b\r\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the De\u00a0Beque Gas Plant PSM/RMP program manual. The prevention program includes the following elements:\r\n\u00a0\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\u000b\u000b\r\nSummit Midstream encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Employee participation activities range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant RMP prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the PSM program manual that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. \r\n\u00a0\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00a0\r\nSummit Midstream maintains a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Company"

The Company ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Company also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\u000b\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\u00a0\r\nSummit Midstream has conducted Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes at the De Beque Gas Plant are identified and controlled. Within the PHA, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Company primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The HAZOP methodology utilizes a systematic nodal approach to assess potential process deviations and associated risks.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when it believes such"

This ranking is measured against the Summit Midstream risk matrix to ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate attention. \r\n\u00a0\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\u00a0\r\nSummit Midstream maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe operating procedures are used to communicate safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) pipe break procedures for hazard mitigation before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\u00a0\r\nTraining\r\n\u00a0\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Summit Midstream has developed a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators will periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\u00a0\r\nContractors\r\n\u00a0\r\nSummit Midstream may use contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Company has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Additionally, gas plant personnel will periodically evaluate the performance of contract employers in complying with plant safety policies and procedures.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\u00a0\r\nSummit Midstream conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. \r\n\u00a0\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency in a timely manner to assure safe operation. \r\n\u00a0\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated, as required, to incorporate the changes.
