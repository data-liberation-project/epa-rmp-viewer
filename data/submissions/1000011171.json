In keeping with this policy, our objective is to reduce the generation or release of toxic pollutants, hazardous substances and hazardous wastes.  By successfully reducing and or eliminating pollution at the source, Chemstar can minimize the impact on the air, water and land.  Chemstar will also achieve cost savings, improve efficiencies, and maintain a safer work place for our employees.\n\nIn order to implement Chemstar's environmental policy, the following guidelines will be observed:\n\n1.  Environmental protection is everyone's responsibility.  It is valued by the company and by the community at large.\n2.  All employees are encouraged to actively seek methods to reduce the generation or release of toxic pollutants at the source,  and to contain all toxic materials within the process.\n3.  Reductions will be made by mechanical methods where possible, and by improved handling methods.\n4.  Process changes which may substitute non-hazardous materials or reduce their usage will be given high priority.\n\nChemstar Products Company seeks to demonstrate itsA? corporate citizenship by adhering to all environmental regulations.  Chemstar promotes cooperation with industry, government and the public in the shared goal of preventing pollution at the source.\n\nChemstar Products Company manufactures starch derivative products such as adhesives and colloids. Our main raw material is corn starch. The finished products are packaged in paper bags and are not considered to be hazardous or to contain hazardous chemicals.\n\nIn the manufacture of certain starch derivatives Chemstar Products Company uses propylene oxide as a raw material.  The propylene oxide is stored in the bulk storage tank manufactured to ASME Code, Section VIII, Division 1, pressure vessel.  The propylene oxide is stored under an inert atm"

The instrumentation feeds the information to a computer that checks to make sure that the storage tank and piping systems are within established operating limits.  If the operating limits fall outside these parameters an alarm will sound, and an indicating light will illuminate showing the problem.  The computer will take corrective action based on the fault.  For example when filling the tank, the computer will signal an alarm at the high level and will shut down filling operations when the level in the storage tank reaches the maximum safe level.  There is a deluge system for the storage tank and bulk delivery truck if conditions exceed safe limits.  This system is automatic and will activate without human input.  There are manual deluge activation switches near the storage tank.  There is also a plant chemical emergency alarm that the plant personal can sound.  The deluge is designed to cover the entire storage tank and delivery truck with a water spray to cool the tank, and, dilute and capture any released propylene oxide.  The water from the deluge system is pumped to two large holding tanks where the water can be treated, if needed, prior to disposal.  For critical alarm conditions there is an auto dialer that will call a set of telephone numbers if the plant alarm in not acknowledged in 6 minutes.  This dialer will continue calling until the alarm is acknowledged.  The computer, monitoring devices and the plant telephone systems are on a back up generator.  These systems will have power in the event that power is lost to the plant or if the main plant breaker is tripped or shut down.\n\nChemstar Products Company has developed an emergency response plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.   Chemstar has also trained plant personnel to a minimum of First Responder Operations Level,  with some employees completing th"

Simulated release drills are conducted at the plant on a regular basis.  Chemstar conducts regular safety meetings with the plant safety committee.  The safety committee is made up of plant employees from various operations such as maintenance, production, packaging, engineering, supervisors and managers.  The employees who serve on the safety committee are rotated off on a regular basis to give more employees the opportunity to provide input on Chemstar's safety policies and address unsafe conditions and practices at the facility."
