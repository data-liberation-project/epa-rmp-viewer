R. Simplot Company Don Plant, Don Siding, Idaho is committed to being a responsible community partner.  Emergency response planning and training of all employees is current and ongoing.  Every reasonable effort is made to prevent a significant accidental release to the air. The Chubbuck Fire Department and local emergency agencies receive the annual Sara Title III reports on materials manufactured, stored, and handled at the Don Plant. Simplot's policy is to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from the regulatory agencies.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances manufactured, processed, stored, or handled\nThe J. R. Simplot Company, Don Plant facility manufactures fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and animal feed supplements. The Don Plant manufactures, processes, stores and handles anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the threshold limits requiring an RMP.\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenarios\nThese scenarios include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each potential scenario.\nSix dispersion models were done for release of ammonia from the Simplot Don plant\nA worst case scenario and five alternative release scenarios were modeled.\nThe worst case scenario assumed  the rupture of one high-pressure storage bullet \nIn this scenario the bullet would release its entire 79 tons of ammonia in 10 minutes.

The recent replacement of both bullets has reduced the potential for mechanical failure.\nThe first alternative release scenario assumed that a pressure relief valve opened and stayed open for ten minutes\nThe relief valve was assumed to open at 200 psig and stay stuck open for ten minutes.  The pressure relief valves vent vertically directly above the tank. The implementation of maintenance procedures to regularly verify proper operation of  pressure relief valves has reduced the potential for this scenario.\nThe second alternative release scenario assumed that a standard loading hose broke\nThis hose would be transferring ammonia from the high-pressure bullet tank at the loading dock.  The bullets were assumed to be at normal pressures of 110 psig.  The assumption was made that the release would continue for ten minutes before flow could be shut off.  The potential for this release has been virtually eliminated by high flow shut off valves on each bullet.\nThe third alternative release scenario assumed that the entire 6500 tons of ammonia in  the low-pressure storage vessel was released\nGuidelines in 40 CFR 68 dictate that the release be modeled as an instantaneous 1cm deep pool.  It is unrealistic to assume that liquid ammonia could spread over this large an area at a uniform thickness without evaporating as it covers the area.  The secondary containment berm would mitigate a release from the low-pressure storage vessel.  Pressure relief valves prevent the vessel from being over-pressurized.\nThe fourth alternative release scenario also assumed that the entire 6500 tons of ammonia in  the low-pressure storage vessel was released over ten  minutes\nThis scenario was modeled with the more realistic assumption of continuous evaporation as the pool expanded.  As with the third scenario, the secondary containment berm would mitigate a release from the low-pressure storage vessel, and pressure relief"
