There are two substances at this facility above the threshold quantity: sulfur dioxide and chlorine (separate, not in mixtures) in cylinders with capacities of 150 pounds and 2000 pounds. The estimated maximum amount of sulfur dioxide on hand is approximately 32,000 pounds total in the containers listed above. The maximum amount of chlorine on hand is approximately 60,000 pounds in the containers listed above. There are no filling processes performed of either chemical at this facility. Only processes associated with sulfur dioxide and chlorine are the storage, loading/unloading, and transportation in and out of this location.\n\n\n\n3.
