      "SummaryText": "  The Town of Yadkinville Waste Water Treatment Plant (  WWTP ) cleans used water and sewage so it can be returned safely to the environment. The WWTP uses chlorine ( CL2 ) to disinfect the used water and sewer. We also use sulfur-dioxide ( SO2 ) to dechlorinate the water at the end of the process. The facility is located on a plot of approximately five acres. Buildings and equipment consists of a automatic bar screen, grit classifier, lift stations, oxidation ditch, airation basin, three clarifiers, chlorine contact chamber, dechlorination chamber, and two sludge digesters. Enclosed structures consist of a lab, maintenance building, three blower buildings, chlorine and sulfur-dioxide chemical room. The Town of Yadkinville started using ton cylinders of CL2 and SO2 in June 1998 after the plant was expanded to treat more used water and sewage. A concrete storage platform, open on all sides with an overhead roof, is used to store the ton cylinders of CL2 and SO2. It has a storage capacity of eight ton cylinders but only six are stored at any given time. We have two CL2 cylinders and two SO2 cylinders connected to the gas supply but only one each is used at any given time on demand. The other CL2 cylinder and SO2 cylinder are kept with steel hoods covering the valve until they are needed.\n  The WWTP complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Other safety rules and regulations are listed and explained in the Employee Safety manual which is given to each new employee. Each new employee signs a document stating he/she read and understood the manual. The employees at the WWTP plant do daily,weekly,monthly,and annual inspections and maintence on the chemical equipment. The list of procedures and what is checked and maintained is found in the Process Safety manual under maintenance procedures. With the use of our PSM program, proper operating and maintence procedures, knowledge of the chemical being used and proper training we hope to prevent a release.       "
