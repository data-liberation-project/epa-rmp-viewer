These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n\t3.2.8  Compliance Audit\r\n\r\nEDCC conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the prevention program set out under Subpart D are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n \r\n3.2.9  Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nEDCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\r\n\r\n\t3.2.10  Employee Participation\r\n\r\nEDCC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

These controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypass system, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, rupture disks, excess flow devices, and quench systems.  Passive mitigation includes earthen dikes that route spills to neutralization and the wastewater treatment system, a deluge system, water curtains, and enclosures.  pH probes and alarms are located throughout the plant's storm water system to alert staff of accidental spills or releases.\r\n\t\r\n3.3.2  Oleum\r\n\r\n\tProcess controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of oleum to the environment.

The explosion did not result in a chemical release.  On-site impact included total destruction of the DSN plant as well as structural damage to surrounding processes.  Off-site impact included minor structural damage to residences and businesses.  No deaths or injuries resulted from the incident.  Procedures following the explosion were executed in accordance with the emergency response plan. Office of Emergency Services, as well as, emergency medical assistance, local fire departments, and county police department were notified for assistance.  \r\nThe DSN plant will be replaced with a new Nitric Acid Concentration (NACSAC&reg;) plant. The NACSAC&reg; plant will concentrate weak nitric acid (56% - 65% strength) to strong nitric acid (greater than 98% strength) by extracting water from the weak nitric acid with sulfuric acid.  Since the previously used strong acid process, which required the addition of oxygen, will not be reintroduced, the potential for this explosion scenario to be repeated is eliminated.\r\n\r\n\t3.4.2  Ammonia\r\n\r\n\tDuring the past five years, EDCC has not had an accidental ammonia release, resulting in on-site or off-site site consequences, including deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place.\r\n\t\r\n\t3.4.3  Oleum\r\n\r\n\tDuring the past five years, EDCC has not had an accidental oleum release resulting in on-site or off-site consequences, including deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation,"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turn-around.  Operating procedures are regularly reviewed and are readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  In addition, Daily/Shift Safe Work Permits (Procedure No. S-82) are required for any maintenance work completed at EDCC.\r\n\r\n\t3.2.4  Training\r\n\r\n\tEDCC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided continuously for operator certification.\r\n&#8195;\r\n\t3.2.5  Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\n\tEDCC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tpressure vessels, \r\n\u00bf\tstorage tanks, \r\n\u00bf\tpiping systems, \r\n\u00bf\trelief and vent systems,\r\n\u00bf\temergency shutdown systems,\r\n\u00bf\tcontrols, and \r\n\u00bf\tpumps.  \r\n\r\nTrained maintenance personnel and the facility's mechanical integrity engineer conduct the process maintenance activities.  These personnel are offered specialized training, as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Daily/Shift Work Permits are required for maintenance/repairs required on equipment and processes at EDCC.\r\n \r\n\t3.2.6  Management of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at EDCC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly"

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The Plan includes the following components:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tprocedures for informing the public and emergency responders of accidental releases,\r\n\u00bf\tdocumentation of proper first aid/emergency medical treatment that may be necessary to treat exposure,\r\n\u00bf\temergency response procedures,\r\n\u00bf\tprocedures for using, inspecting, testing, and maintaining response equipment,\r\n\u00bf\temployee training, and\r\n\u00bf\tresponse plan review and update procedures.\r\n\r\nCoordination of the Plan with the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is an integral part of the verification process.  \r\n\r\n3.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nEDCC is actively promoting public awareness and education programs concerning emergency response through the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Community Advisory Panel.  This education process enhances the public's ability to respond in a given emergency situation.  EDCC continually strives to improve and upgrade operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment, and develop and implement safety improvement projects.  A list of proposed future improvements is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tcontinue the partnership and education process with local fire departments to ensure fire department personnel are knowledgeable of site specific processes, materials and products and, as necessary, assist them in updating a site specific fire plan;  \r\n\u00bf\tprovide continued EMT training to employees and on-site confined space rescue team; and\r\n\u00bf\tinstall card reader entrances;\r\n\u00bf\tacquire additional security guards"
