A signal is sent to the central computer and is logged within alarm history and will wait for operator response, otherwise, if time occurs, operators are paged.  An initial shutdown occurs at 250 ppm which does the following: (1) Shut down of solenoid valves in order to isolate the ammonia, (2) The purge ventilation fan is turned on with a manual reset required, (3) scrubbing system pumps and fans are turned on with a manual reset required, and (4) Signal is sent to notify operator (refrigeration contractor).  A final shutdown occurs at 10,000 ppm which de-energizes all of the equipment in the machine room including the compressors.  The facility is equipped with an automatic shut off button located outside of the Machine room.  If a release were to occur, operators can activate this prevention measure.  The majority of the ammonia equipment is located in the Machine Room. \n\nSensors are also located within Machine Room 2 (July 2001) which alarm at 30 ppm.  A signal is sent to the auto dialer (Security Link) who contacts operators.  At 120 ppm, Security Link is instructed to call the fire department.  Exhaust fans are energized and exhaust is routed from engine room to condenser inlet.  Automatic controls energize condenser fans.  Shutdown occurs at 10,000 ppm which de-energizes all of the equipment in the machine room including the compressors.  The facility is equipped with three automatic shut off buttons located outside of the Machine Room 2 doors.  If a release were to occur, managers or operators can activate this prevention measure.

There were several mitigation measures recommended at that time.  The recommendations will be completed by July 2002.  Some of the mitigation measures implemented included the following items:\n\nR01:Conduct an awareness training program that includes informing all employees of the following: 1) the presence of and the hazards associated with ammonia at the facility, 2) what to do if they observe an ammonia leak, and 3) where to go when they are told to evacuate.\n\nR02:Consider having local Fire Department team participate in the evacuation drills and familiarize them with the system, equipment location within the facility, and of Telco's and Key Mechanical's capabilities.\n\nR03:Consider implementing a periodic test to verify ammonia sensors are operational.\n\nR04:Ensure that dual relief valves are replaced/recertified on a 5-year schedule.  Also, replace any relief valve that engages to vent pressure.    \n\nR05:Consider conducting an annual visual inspection for rust on all exterior ammonia piping into the maintenance program.

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Response section of the PSM/RMP document as well as the Business Plan.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly areas, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Telco facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 2111 West Valley Blvd., Colton, CA 92324 and began operation in 1999.  In October 2000, the facility added new freezer and cooler rooms which required additional evaporators (10), compressors (2), and condenser (1).  In July 2001, an additional separate and independent ammonia refrigeration system containing 21,000 lbs. of ammonia was installed.\n\nThe area immediately surrounding the facility is comprised of commercial areas and vacant fields with residences to the north.  The facility is situated approximately 0.3 miles north of Interstate 10.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the industrial refrigeration system that provides cold storage for food products.  The original ammonia refrigeration system uses 19,100 pounds of ammonia within a closed system for the purpose of manufacturing bakery products.  The July 2001 ammonia system uses 21,000 lbs of ammonia.  The system cycles ammonia through various physical states in order to provide cooling in the bakery production processes and cold storage rooms. \n\n\nACCID"
