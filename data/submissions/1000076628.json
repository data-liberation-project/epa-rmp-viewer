Tanimura and Antle has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manuals to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  Tanimura and Antle interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\r\n\r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\r\n\r\nAny release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending on the location of the release.

Tanimura and Antle hires security guards (contractors) to patrol the facility and refrigeration contractors to maintain the refrigeration system. Operational employees working in the cold rooms are hired by the tenant, Braga Fresh, not Tanimura and Antle. Security guards, refrigeration contractors, and operational employees at this facility are trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia system on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. This team activity is the core of Tanimura and Antle's prevention program.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Tanimura and Antle facility provides product cooling, and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Monterey county on a contiguous property. The latitude and longitude provided for the facility are the coordinates for the engine room and are the coordinates used in the release scenarios. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Plant Refrigeration System. The total ammonia inventory in the Main Plant system exceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration systems are direct, mechanical refrigeration systems. The original facilities were built prior to 1990 and have been expanded and modified since then. The ammonia equipment is located outside or in the Refrigerated Rooms.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \r\n\r\nThe number of residents affected by the worst case scenario varies depending on the season.

The estimated residental population within distance to the endpoint in response to question 2.12 is based on the number of residents that could be affected by the worst case scenario during the summer. There would be fewer residents within the distance to the endpoint during the winter.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition, as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nTanimura and Antle's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Tanimura and Antle is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\r\n\r\nKey objectives of Tanimura and Antle's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\r\n\r\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Tanimura and Antle.

Refrigeration contractors are trained by their direct employers before they work on Tanimura and Antle's refrigeration system.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\r\n\r\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  Second, all employees of Braga Fresh, the tenant operating at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  This facility has no direct hire employees.  Braga Fresh employees have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\r\n\r\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Tanimura and Antle's Management of Change Procedure. \r\n \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Tanimura and Antle has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.  Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Tanimura and Antle Hot Work permit is required.

This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Tanimura and Antle personnel.
