              "Description": "This process consists of two storage tanks and is interconnected with five reaction vessels in a manufacturing building, and interconnecting piping.  The storage tanks are located within a concrete diked area, complete with a firewater sprinkler system and a flammable vapor detection system. The tanks are pressure vessels with a design working pressure of 75 PSIG. The storage tanks utilize relief valves with rupture dies, freon refrigeration, and a nitrogen gas (inert) blanketing system as control devices.\n\nThe storage tank area contains a firewater system supply controlled by a flammable vapor detection system. The presence of flammable vapor causes the firewater sprinkler system to activate causing a water deluge to occur in the ethylene oxide storage tank area.\nThe reactor vessels have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen gas purge system, emergency air supply, a computer distributed control system, plus an instrument interlock system which will not allow ethylene oxide to be fed into a reactor vessel unless a number of process parameters are satisfied.\nThe plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, hazard communication training, and HAZWOPER training. All production tickets are reviewed by the engineering department after a production run has been completed.",

              "Description": "This process consists of the formaldehyde storage tank, seven reactor vessels in one manufacturing building, five reactor vessels in another manufacturing building, and the interconnecting piping. The formaldehyde is stored in an insulated heated above ground storage tank. The storage tank is blanketed with nitrogen gas and the nitrogen gas/formaldehyde vapors are vented to the plant vapor combustor system as a control device. The tank is equipped with high liquid level shutoff protection and 'reliefvalve protection. A firewater system with hydrant monitors is available for use in fire conditions. Both fire fighting foam and spill control (vapor suppression) foam is maintained at the plant.\nThe reactor vessels in both manufacturing buildings have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen purge systems, a vapor combustor for vapor destruction, emergency air supply, and a computer distributed control system for batch reaction control.\nThe plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, hazard communication training, and HAZWOPER training.",
