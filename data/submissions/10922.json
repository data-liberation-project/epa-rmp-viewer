This program is implemented in California as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThe scope of this RMP is based on discussions with the Administering Agency (AA), the Los Angeles County Fire Department, to ensure that all issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.  With input from the AA, the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage and handling facility was identified as the only process that triggers the CalARP requirements.  This process was determined to be covered by Program 2 requirements.  The process hazard review technique consisting of a Hazard Operability Study (HAZOP) was then presented to and approved by the AA and the level of detail for this RMP submission agreed upon.\n\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nPebbly Beach Generating Station, located in Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, California, is a combination electric generating station and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution facility.  Pebbly Beach Generating Station provides both electricity and gas for the entire island.  The electric generating station is comprised of 6 internal combustion engines combusting distillate fuel with a total generating capacity of 9.33 MW.  The LPG system is comprised of four 30000 gal storage tanks, one 16000 gal storage tank, truck unloading bulkhead, LPG dispenser, LPG compressor, LPG sensors, LPG vaporizers (3), LPG mixers, deluge system, Unit 15"

Several components of LPGre subject to the requirements of the Federal Risk Management Program and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These include propane (CAS Number 74-98-6), butane (CAS Number 106-97-8), ethane (CAS Number 74-84-0), and methane (CAS Number 74-82-8).\n\n\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis prepared in support of this RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA as incorporated in RMP*Comp, version 1.06.  The following release scenarios were hypothesized:\n\nRelease Scenario I - Worst-Case \n\nThe entire contents of the largest LPG storage tank (30,000 gal capacity) is released, a vapor cloud forms, and detonates in a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.4 miles beyond which the pressure wave resulting from detonation is sufficiently dispersed to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nRelease Scenario II - Alternative \n\nThe entire contents of the delivery trucks hose carrying LPG between the truck shut-off valve and tank hook-up is released by a failed delivery hose due to a pull-away without unhooking, vaporizes, and detonates in a vapor cloud explosion.  Active mitigation are assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose.  The estimated distance to 1 psi over pressure is <0.1 miles beyond which the pressure wave resulting from detonation is sufficiently dispersed to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nRelease Scenario III - Alternative\n\nThe entire contents of the all LPG piping onsite is released by a pipe failure resulting in vaporization and detonation.  The estimated distance to 1 psi over pressure is 0.22 miles beyond which the pressure wave resulting from detonation is sufficiently dispersed to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\n\n1.4 Summary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the LPG storage and  handling system at"

A key component of this overall program is the Gas System Emergency Plan elements which include:\n\n7 specific actions to be taken in response to,\n7 gas leak emergencies\n7 severe damage resulting from natural causes, accidents, or sabotage\n7 interruption of service or over-pressure/under-pressure\n7 fire or explosions\n7 procedures to notify local and public agencies including the Avalon Fire Department, the Office of Emergency Services and the National Response Center as necessary\n7 a list of resources for emergency health care\n7 information regarding the training of employees \n\n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBelow are listed recommendations developed by the HAZOP team during the PHA study at Pebbly Beach Generating Station.
