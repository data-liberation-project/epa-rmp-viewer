It is a 1243 acre campus with 135 structures and  is located in a rural community area in northern California. Sonoma Developmental Center operates a Water Treatment Plant for the supply of water needed for the facilities residents, staff, food preparations, and grounds irrigation. The water is treated with a chlorine injection system upon leaving the plant to be stored in above ground storage tanks. A 2000-pound container of chlorine and up to 3, 150-pound containers of chlorine are stored in a room adjacent to the Water Treatment Plant. The system includes vacuum regulators, chlorine injectors and piping. Should a leak occur, and vacuum drop, the system will shut the flow of chlorine to the system.\n\nBecause of the quantity of chlorine onsite, SDC is required by the EPA to submit this Risk Management Plan. It is Sonoma Developmental Center\u00bfs policy that we strictly adhere to provisions in the RMP plan. Water Treatment Plant personnel are trained and certified in handling and applying chlorine at the facility. \n\nSonoma Developmental Center has its own Fire Department located at the facility. It is approximately .5 miles from the WTP. Eldridge Fire Dept. has in place a Hazardous Material/Hazardous Waste Contingency\nPlan prepared pursuant of 22 CCR 66265.51, et seq., and is designed to minimize hazards to human health and the environment from fire,explosions,and/or unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous material/hazardous waste constituents into the work places, the air, soil or water.\n\nThe provisions of this Contingency Plan are intended to be carried out immediately whenever there is fire, explosion or release of hazardous material/hazardous waste or hazardous material/hazardous waste constituents which threaten human health, the environment or property.\n\n\nIn the event of  a detected catastrophic chlorine release a Shelter in Place Order"

A Phone Tree has been set up to alert Living Units, Support Units, and on grounds residential housing. Further Shelter in Place orders for outlying residences and businesses will be ordered by the IC.\n\nThe chlorine storage building is clearly marked for all emergency responders. Chlorine monitors with audible alarms and remote alarms will be maintained and tested weekly by water treatment plant personnel. A log of maintenance and testing will be kept by water treatment plant personnel. A Vegetation Management Plan with our Grounds Staff is in place to address brush and tree removal. A cleared area of 25 feet around the chlorine storage structure will be maintained in vegetation free condition as a precautionary in the event of a wildland fire. \n\nSDC is updating  its monitor and detection system to include a phone modem to alert the facilities main phone operator in the event of a chlorine leak. The operators position is staffed 24/7 and they are directly connected with Sonoma County's central dispatcher for emergency vechiles. The Eldridge Fire Department will be notified when an alarm is sounded. This system has an in service date of  3-15-05\n\nSDC is looking at new technologies to improve safety and to implement them when resources allow.\n  \nDuring the last 5 years there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the SDC Water Treatment Plant. There have been no injuries due to chlorine exposure.\n.\nSDC also has its own State Police Department. The Water Treatment Plant is regularly patrolled 24/7."
