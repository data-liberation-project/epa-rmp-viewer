It continues through having employees trained in proper safety and handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely handle chemicals.  Hawkins also adherence to OSHA workplace rules as part of our safety program.  We follow industry standards, such as those of the National Chemical Distribution Association, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.  Containment basins are utilized to capture any liquid spills from getting into the environment and a scrubber system is used to capture vapors/gas from the air.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History:  There has not been an accidental release from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, s"
