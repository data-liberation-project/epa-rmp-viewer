              "Description": "3.0   Prevention Program\n\nThe transload process at TRANSFLO has a NAICS Code of 48211 and is considered a ?Program 2? level prevention program as described in Subpart D of 40 CFR 68 (68.48 through 68.60).  This terminal utilizes a series of terminal specific work instructions and procedures for the daily operations including the transload of pentane.  Specific documents referenced in the RMP are found in an electronic operating procedures manual accessible to the terminal management and employees.  Written copies of work instructions are available at the terminal but are not considered controlled documents.  The seven requirements for the prevention program are described below and will be implemented on a daily basis at the Sanford terminal.\n\n3.1 Safety Information (40 CFR 68.48)\n\nRMP safety information requirements include compiling written information concerning equipment and processes.  Compiled information must address:\n\n?Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)\n?Maximum inventory\n?Storage and Process limits\n?Equipment Specifications\n?Codes and Standards\n\nTRANSFLO maintains a current MSDS for pentane in the terminal mangers office and in the terminal Hazard Communication station as required for 29 CFR 1910.1200.\n\nThe MSDS for pentane, equipment specification and product storage information are included in this RMP as Attachment 3-1.\n\n3.2Hazard Review (40 CFR 68.50)\n\nAn initial hazard review was conducted on the transfer process and equipment by TRANSFLO personnel, the equipment supplier and outside safety professional consultants during the normal TRANSFLO new business development process.\n\nA pre-start up hazard review using a ?what if checklist? process was conducted on April 7, 2006.\n\nTo prevent / control the catastrophic release of pentane, the following controls are integrated into the transfer process:\n\na.   Railcar-\n     o  Double shelf couplers (to prevent tank punctures during car handling)\n     o  Bottom outlet protection\n     o  Safety relief valve\n\nb. Terminal Physical Plant\n    o  Bonded and grounded track\n    o  Paved transfer area with spill control \n    o Track spill pans \n\nc. Transfer Unit\n   o Bonding cables\n   o High level probe\n   o Liquid volume meter \n   o Remote electrical shut of capability\n   o Closed loop vapor recovery system\n\n\n3.3 Operating Procedures  (40 CFR 68.52)\n\nTRANSFLO operating procedures address the steps for each operating phase, operating limits and safety system and their functions.\n\nSpecific requirements are as follows:\n\n  ? Initial start up\n  ? Normal operations\n  ? Temporary Operations\n  ? Emergency Operations\n  ? Normal Shutdown\n  ? Start up following a turnaround or emergency shutdown\n  ? Consequences of deviations\n  ? Equipment inspections\n\nTransfer process work instructions were developed for this unit and are used as the basis for training employees who will be operating the system.  These procedures will be maintained at the terminal office and will be used for employee evaluation and audit purposes.  These work instructions are included in Attachment 3-3.\n\nIn addition to the transfer work instruction, the terminal operator follows established TRANSFLO procedures for the inspection of inbound railcars, inbound ISO containers and general health, safety and environmental procedures.  Copies of these are included in Attachment 3-3\n\n3.4 Training (40 CFR 68.54)\n\nAs required under 40 CFR 68.54, training requirements for new operators at TRANSFLO include training on operating procedures and must cover health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the employee normal job or function.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.  The facility also determines that each operator has received and understands the training requirements and keeps a record of complete training for each employee with the date of the training and the method used to verify that the employee understand the subject matter.\n\nThe training program includes classroom and on job instruction with emphasis on safety and health hazards and emergency response procedures.  These materials are maintained in the terminal managers office.  Verification that the operators understand the materials is accomplished through written tests, verbal questioning and hands-on demonstrations.  More detailed training documentation and information is given in Attachment 3-4.\n\n3.5 Maintenance  (40 CFR 68.56)\n\nAs required by the regulations, TRANSFLO implements a maintenance program that includes the preventative maintenance, inspection and testing of the pentane transfer unit.  The specific required provisions are as follows:\n \n  ? Written procedures- Administrative guidance\n  ? Training\n  ? Inspection and Testing\n\nTRANSFLO follows a maintenance program to assure system equipment integrity is maintained.\n\nTerminal personnel are responsible for level 1 maintenance on the transfer equipment that includes:\n\n  ? Daily inspection of the transfer unit\n  ? Cleaning of the unit\n  ? Hose inspections (visual)\n  ? Unit tire pressure\n  ? Unit lubrication\n  ? Unit electrical cord and plug inspection\n\nAll maintenance on the unit?s meter, pump or electrical systems are performed by he equipments supplier, RBT Inc., TRANSFLO Regional Equipment Mangers or qualified outside contractors using internal maintenance procedures specific by individual component suppliers.\n\nMaintenance and testing of the railroad tank cars and ISO containers are the responsibility of the car or container owners or leasors.\n\n\n\n3.6 Compliance Audits (40 CFR 68.58)\n\nTRANSFLO is required to conduct compliance audits at least every 3 years from the date of RMP submission.  The audit must include an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of risk management program elements and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that systems are effectively implemented and operational.  The compliance audits will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the pentane transfer process.  TRANSFLO will comply with the following document requirements:\n\n ? The employer must certify the compliance audits\n ? A written report of the findings of the audit shall be developed.\n ? The employer shall promptly determine and document an appropriate    response to each of the findings of the audit.\n  ? The employers shall document that any deficiencies have been corrected.\n  ? The employer shall retain the most recent compliance audits reports/.\n  ? The compliance audits shall be made available to employees and their  designated representatives.\n\nAs required, TRANSFLO will undergo an audit every 3 years.  The first audit is scheduled for June 2009.   In addition to the scheduled RMP specific audit, TRANSFLO has an active terminal operation audit system that includes a review the following:\n\n  ? Terminal HS&E regulatory compliance\n  ? Terminal employee training\n  ? Transfer operations including compliance with Work Instructions, procedures and polices\n   ? Terminal physical plant maintenance and documentation\n   ? Transfer equipment inspection, maintenance and documentation.\n\n\nTRANSFLO Operations and HS&E personnel conduct these audits.  The Director of Operations reviews the results of these audits and items of nonconformance are the responsibility of the Manger of Field Operations and the contract operator for correction.\n\n3.7 Incident Investigation  (40 CFR 68.60)\n\nIncident investigation is the process of identifying the underlying causes of incidents and implementing steps to prevent similar events from occurring.  The RMP requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could reasonable have resulted in a catastrophic release of regulated substance, employee injury or off site impact.\n\n\n\nThe specific requirements of the incident investigation are as follows:\n\n   ? Initiate an investigation promptly, no later than 48 hours after the incident.\n   ? Establish an investigation team with at least one team member knowledgeable in the transfer process.\n   ? Summarize the investigation in a report, including:\n       o Date of incident\n       o Date investigation begin\n       o Description of the incident\n       o Factors contributing to the incident\n       o Root cause of the incident\n       o Any recommendations to prevent future incidents\n\nAddress and resolve the team?s finding and recommendations\n     ? Document resolutions and corrective actions\n     ? Review the report with affected personnel and contactors where applicable\n     ? Retain the report for five years.\n\nTRANSFLO has established incident investigation procedures for the pentane transfer process as follows:\n\n1. The facility maintains an updated comprehensive Emergency Action pan (EAP) for injuries, spills, fires and other credible terminal threats.  All employees are trained on the activation of the EAP and their roles.  An annual response exercise is held and includes an invitation to the local fire department to attend using the EAP.\n2. All product releases are reported following the incident reporting procedures list in the EAP.\n3. Upon completion of the emergency phase of the incident, a formalized incident investigation process is initiated using the documents listed in attachment 3-7.\n\nTRANSFLO holds an incident review conference call or on-site investigation meeting within 5 days of any spill or incident with employee injury, evacuation or off site consequence.  Senior operations personnel lead this call from TRANSFLO, the contract operator and other groups or agencies with significant incident involvement.\n\nThe pentane transfer process will be install in the Sanford, FL terminal by April 7, 2006.  This is a new product for this terminal but uses equipment, procedures and processes sued in this terminal and the TRANSFLO network for over 10 years.  There have been no incidents or releases of pentane involving this equipment or process.",

The TTSI terminal provides Transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.  The Sanford TRANSFLO terminal has been in operation since 1988.  The terminal is located at 2591 West 5th Street, Sanford, FL.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTRANSFLO will handle pentane at this terminal, Transloading product from railroad tank cars into ISO intermodal containers in quantities in excess of 30,000 gallons which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for pentane using the parameters specified by the EPA.  TRANSFLO?s worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single railroad tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, TRANSFLO has not considered any passive mitigation measures.  Using the EPA?s RMP*Comp software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nTRANSFLO also evaluated several other release s"

      "SummaryText": "cenarios considered to have a high-level probability of occurrence (although stall a very low probability) based upon a review of over 10 years of incident data from chemical transloading operations.  This 10 year period included the safe handling of over 500,000 rail to truck chemical transloads.  After a careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, TRANSFLO has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of product transfer hose.  In developing the parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, TRANSFLO considered the average response time of terminal personnel to control the release and safely shut the transfer unit down.   Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA?s RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flammable endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in off site consequences at distance much less than the worst-case scenario and would largely be limited to terminal property itself.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of pentane, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures:\n\n?    TRANSFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOP?S) for the Transloading of pentane from railcar to ISO containers for use by trained and qualified personnel.\n?    TRANSFLO encourages contract operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and processes involving this product.  Employees are expected to follow established procedures until employee driven process changes are implemented, training conducted and communicated to all affected persons.\n?    TRANSFLO conducts operational audits and inspections to insure compliance with established operating procedures, maintenance of transfer equipment and facility physical systems.\n?
