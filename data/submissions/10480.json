      "SummaryText": "Tenneco Packaging - NAPP, Granite Falls, NC\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe at Tenneco are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Caldwell County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Granite Falls Fire Department to provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polyethylene foam products that is used as packaging material. We have one regulated substance present at our facility, butane.  This regulated substance is used as a blowing agent at our facility. \n\nThe maximum inventory of butane at our facility is 75,000 lbs.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and alternative release scenario, we have used equations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA's) RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance which involves a catastrophic release from a butane storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 45,000 lbs. of butane.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have not been considered when evaluating this worst case scenario.  For this scenario"

      "SummaryText": ", it is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under the worst case weather conditions, the consequence distance from the explosion of the vapor cloud to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) is 0.3 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance which involves a release of butane from an overfilled storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 9700 lb. of butane which is assumed to result in a pool fireThe maximum distance from the center of the pool where people can potentially receive second degree burns from a 40-second exposure is 0.1 miles.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration  (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we have submitted a Title V air permit application. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at Tenneco.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nTenneco maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nTenneco conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  \"What If\" methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years and when major changes are made to the covere"
