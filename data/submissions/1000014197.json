Operating in a safe and environmentally protective manner are values held above all others.  Pasadena Plastics Complex is focused on preventing serious process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, visitors, the community or the environment.  The process safety management (PSM) program demonstrates this focused commitment.  The PSM program involves the application of management systems and performance management practices to control process hazards through objectives, programs, procedures, audits, evaluations, and training that considers safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  \n\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved, among other things, through the company's Employee Safety Process, Tenets of Operation guiding principles and S.A.F.E (Safety Awareness For Everyone) program.    Planned changes to improve safety at the Pasadena Plastics Complex are reviewed and adjusted annually. They are also included in the yearly budgets; and incorporated into the performance management systems / practice throughout the organization.  These planned changes include, but are not limited to safety related capital projects, safety programs / initiatives, procedure improvements, and SOP validations.   \n\nAdditionally, in the management systems and performance management practices used at the Pasadena Plastics Complex and are measured using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  Careful attention to the right measurements helps to ensure that performance trends, both positive and negative, are recognized"

Investigations will be conducted with the objective of determining the causes and prevention of future incidents.\n\nThe knowledge that is gained from accident/incident reports, maintenance records, case histories, and trend analysis of incidents will provide basic information and potential changes that can be used to help further prevent catastrophic events.  As a tool to help manage this knowledge, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has implemented a Knowledge Management System (KMS).  This corporate computer based system assists in tracking and sharing environmental, health and safety recommendations, changes and incidents.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Pasadena Plastics Complex located in Pasadena, Texas operates several plastic resin manufacturing processes and one specialty chemical manufacturing process. \n\nThe plastic resin manufacturing processes utilize various regulated flammable chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, isobutane, propane, and pentane to produce plastic resin.   The plastic resin manufacturing process also utilizes the regulated toxic chemical chlorine for process water treatment.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, Pasadena Plastics Complex.  Pasadena Plastics Complex is an OSHA PSM regulated facility.  Therefore, the elements of the Pasadena Plastics Complex PSM program / OSHA PSM standard, which essentially mirror the prevention program requirement of the EPA's RMP standard, have been in place since 1992.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe intent of employee particip"

Employees have access to information developed to comply with the PSM standard in the Pasadena Plastics Complex Central Office Building Library.  Examples of employee participation range from reviewing process safety information and Standard Operating Procedures to serving on Process Hazard Analysis teams.  \n\nPasadena Plastics Complex also utilizes other processes such as company communication tools and the Employee Safety Process to keep employee participation evergreen and provide periodic reminders to the employees that their process safety concerns and suggestions are welcome.  \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex compiles and maintains written process safety information to enable both the employer and employee the ability to effectively identify and understand the hazards posed by the process.  Written PSI provides employees with a baseline of information to identify hazards of the chemicals used or produced in the process, information about the technology of the process, and information about the equipment in the process.  This PSI provides the foundation for performing the unit Process Hazards Analysis, developing operating procedures, and determining the applicability of management of change. The record copy of this formation is maintained in the Pasadena Plastics Complex Central Office Building Library. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA process hazard analysis is a detailed and systematic evaluation of all aspects of the process (equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures) to identify the potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  PHAs are performed on existing and new units in all of Pasadena Plastics Complex's nine covered processes.

A PHA results in action items (findings/recommendations) that identify and address perceived potential hazards.  The action items are prioritized for management and employee resolution utilizing the scheme below:\n\nPasadena Plastics Complex additionally uses Layers of Protection Analysis methodology (commonly referred to as LOPA) to integrate process risk management into a unified, comprehensive program and identify Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in accordance with ANSI/ISA S84.01-1996 and IEC 61511.  \n\nIndependent Protection Layers (IPLs) are systems used to mitigate serious environmental and process safety risk, identified during the process hazard analysis.  IPLs include specific and identified standard operating procedures, alarms with operator response, safety instrumented systems, emergency shutdown systems, and protective devices. IPLs can be viewed as one of the first line of defense against a potential incident and often decrease the frequency of a potential incident.\n\nIPL Analysis provides the risk assessment methodology for the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is an integral part of the PSM program. If an action items arises from the analysis it will be managed and tracked to completion.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures (SOP) provide clear instructions for the safe operations and control of the process and associated equipment.  SOP's are readily accessible to operations personnel in the control rooms and all other employees via the electronic delivery system.  The SOP's address various phases of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations; emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and subsequent startup.

Operator Training has been developed to equip operators with the knowledge and skill necessary to safely and proficiently perform their job duties.  This training emphasized specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.  Written tests, oral tests, observation, demonstration and peer evaluations are utilized to verify the training.\n\nRefresher training/certification is provided every three years to operations personnel on the operating units for which they are responsible.  Training in safe work practices is given to employees during new employee safety orientation, annual safety training, special classes and monthly safety meetings.  \n\nContractors\n\nContract employees at Pasadena Plastics Complex provide labor for general maintenance or repairs, turnarounds, major renovations, construction, demolition, equipment installation or specialty work on or adjacent to covered processes.  Thus, their actions may have an influence on process safety.  Pasadena Plastics Complex informs contractors of known potentials fire, explosion or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process as well as the emergency action plan, safe work practices and sign-in/sign-out requirements for Pasadena Plastics Complex during the Contractor Safety Orientation.  The contractor employer is responsible for assuring that each contract employee is trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe intent of the mechanical integrity program is to provide a management system that ensures:  (1) the equipment is maintained in a manner to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic relea"
