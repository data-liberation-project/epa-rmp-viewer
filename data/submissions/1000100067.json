These high standards include:\n\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Bushton Complex is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.    Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n-\tProviding overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels.\n-\tProviding level transmitters and alarms on all vessels to help prevent overfilling.\n-\tConducting preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical   Integrity program to help ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare. \n-\tEnsuring hydrocarbon vapor is removed and burned by installing degassifiers at the north and south brine systems.\n-\tInstalling hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the gas plant and at every well in the storage facility.\n-\tMinimizing the potential for a catastrophic event by providing a utility water system throughout the gas plant and in the pipeline area.\n-\tInstalling security lighting and surveil"

(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK\u0092s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nONEOK owns and operates a natural gas liquids (NGL) fractionation plant and underground cavern storage facility located near Bushton, KS.  The Bushton Fractionator receives raw natural gas liquids via pipeline, which are then fractionated into various products.  These products include ethane/propane (E/P mix), propane, iso-butane, normal butane, refinery grade butane, and 14# gasoline.  The storage facility receives products from the fractionator as well as from incoming pipeline and stores the substances in underground storage caverns.  From the storage caverns, products are sent to customers via outgoing pipeline.  Additionally, propane is loaded on trucks for distribution to customers.  The RMP flammable substances and mixtures stored or processed at the facility are E/P mix, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, refinery-grade butane, Y-Grade (raw feed), and 14# Gasoline.  There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amo"
