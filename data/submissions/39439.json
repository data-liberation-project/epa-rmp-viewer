The maximum \n     quantity handled would be 256800#.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n   The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, \n  or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\n The facility has:\n a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as \n     required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n c. a"
