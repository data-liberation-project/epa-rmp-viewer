ICS provides training for all its associates and has provided provisions for alerting the public in case of an accidental release. ICS has provided Worst Case as well as Alternate Case scenarios in order to prepare for any unforeseen accidents that might occur within the System. The program one process utilized at Industrial Cold Storage is Ammonia. Ammonia Refrigeration is used through out the facility to keep room temperatures within acceptable limits for the product stored. There is an ammonia alarm system installed that is monitored 24hrs a day, 7 days a week by an outside contractor in order to provide immediate response to any release large or small. The Facility's refrigeration maintenance team has training in Hazardous Response. This team will work in conjunction with the Jacksonville Fire/Hazardous Department when responding to an emergency. The Jacksonville Fire/Hazardous Department has a fully trained and equipped Hazmat Team on call around the clock. All refrigeration equipment is included in a preventative maintenance program and all maintenance is performed by our in-house refrigeration technicians. ICS has a Process Safety Management in place and is up to date on all PHA analysis and Compliance audits. The ultimate goal of ICS is to provide a safe and accident free workplace. In order to achieve this goal, ICS will be providing annual operator refresher, hazardous materials, and incident investigation training. Training will also be provided for refrigeration safety audits, employee awareness, and predictive maintenance for refrigeration equipment. All processes in the safe upkeep of the Refrigeration System will be updated in-house by qualified maintenance personnel. It is our belief by providing adequate knowledge and training in all aspects of the Refrigeration System, ICS will have done its part in keeping "
