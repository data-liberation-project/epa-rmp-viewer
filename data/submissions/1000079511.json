Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated. The facility has installed these types of valves at each of the system's oil drain points. Modifications have been made to the system to provide support in the event of seismic activity. Relief valves have been piped to a common header that terminates at the bottom of an ammonia-water diffusion tank system. Relief valve excursions were another unwanted release potential and by routing to a secondary containment system should no longer affect people on or off-site.\r\n\r\nOther Ammonia-Specific Release Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\n - A computer monitoring system that monitors process parameters 24/7/365. This ammonia alarm system is continuously monitored via a third-party security company.\r\n - CWC has enclosed the facility with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the facility from potential wrong-do-ers.\r\n - Access to process areas is controlled by a sign-in/sign-out program\r\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandals, etc. Training is documented through an online training system (WBBM).\r\n - A relationship exists with the Oxnard Fire Department. There have been demonstrations and tours of the system to familiar"
