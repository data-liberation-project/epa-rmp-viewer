      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nDean Dairy Holdings, LLC processes fluid dairy products, ice cream and frozen desserts at Barber Court, Jefferson County, Birmingham, Alabama. The site is located on approximately 21 acres. The site consists of two separate manufacturing facilities which operate independent anhydrous ammonia systems. System #1 contains approximately 45,000 pounds of ammonia, System #2 contains approximately 23,000 pounds of ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of fluid dairy products, ice cream and frozen desserts within the facilities.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDean Dairy Holding, LLC is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees, and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate actions to take in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nAs a part or its PSM Program, Dean Dairy Holdings has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs include:\n\n1.    Process Safety Information\n\n2.    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n3.    Operating Procedures\n\n4.    Training\n\n5.    Mechanical Integrity\n\n6.    M"

Hot Work Permits\n\n12.    Contractor Safety\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n    `\n\nDean Dairy Holdings, LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidents during this period.\n\nEmergency Response Information\n\n\n\nAs a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident. The plan includes all aspects of emergency planning including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evaluations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911, which will notify the Jefferson County Fire Department. In addition, the Jefferson County LEPC has included Dean Dairy Holdings, LLC in its local emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nSteps to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Increased employee training, on-site visits/training with local emergency responders, and daily inspections of ammonia inventories as well as critical equipment settings are some of the major steps taken to improve safety at our facility.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with industry standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
