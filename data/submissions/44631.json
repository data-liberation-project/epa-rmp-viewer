      "SummaryText": "Wastewater arrives at the Rocky River WWTP from the Town?s sewer collection system.  The wastewater is screened and then distributed into aeration basins where biological treatment takes place.  The treated sewage then goes into a clarifier where the solids and liquid are separated.  Clarified water is disinfected with chlorine.  During the chlorination process, a chlorinator mixes chlorine gas with water to make a chlorine solution which is injected into a contact chamber with the treated wastewater.  The chlorine solution kills remaining pathogens in the wastewater following biological treatment that are dangerous to humans, animals, and aquatic life.  The treated and disinfected water is then discharged into Dye Creek.\n\nChlorine is a regulated toxic chemical by 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore any process utilizing over 2,500 pounds of chlorine must implement Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Rocky River WWTP stores approximately 6,500 pounds of chlorine and is therefore subject to RMP requirements.  The storage of chlorine also makes the facility subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nThe worst case, toxic release scenario is a release of gas from a single 2,000 pound cylinder in ten minutes.  The alternative toxic release scenario is a slower release approximated as a leak evacuating a cylinder in a total of 100 minutes.  Again, this would involve a release of 2,000 pounds, over longer period of time.  These releases could affect local populations.\n\nThe Town of Mooresville and the Rocky River WWTP personnel are committed to the safe operation of the wastewater treatment plant.  To prevent toxic releases of chlorine, the facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard.  All tenets of the Process Safety Management Program are included by reference into this RMP.\n\nAspects of the release prevention program include written operations procedures, inspections of equipment, employee training, automatic shutoff equipment, and a chlorine gas det"

As a testament to these programs, the Rocky River WWTP has not had a chlorine release in the past five years.\n\nEmergency response to accidents and releases is coordinated with the Iredell County ECOM (Emergency Communications, Operations, and Management).  In the event of a chlorine accident or release, facility personnel are trained to notify the Iredell County ECOM by calling 911.  Police, Fire, and/or Hazmat personnel will be dispatched."
