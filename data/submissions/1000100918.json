The Hillshire Brands Company operations include slaughtering, de-boning, and some processing. The Hillshire Brands Company has been in operation at this facility for over 50 years providing quality meat products and 740 jobs to the local community.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nThe Hillshire Brands Company is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. It is The Hillshire Brands Company policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68, as applicable. Accidental releases are kept small or eliminated and emergency response readiness is maintained through the processes implemented per requirements of these regulations.\r\n\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Hillshire Brands Company is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products. The Hillshire Brands Company also operates freezers and coolers for product storage.  The Hillshire Brands Company uses anhydrous anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers.

In addition, The Hillshire Brands Company's ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted industry standards and good engineering practices. \r\n\r\nThe Hillshire Brands Company has also developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program pursuant to Occupational Health and Safety Agency (OSHA) regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases. Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic level controls and automatic process shutdown).  In addition, Hillshire Brands has trained approximately 20 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HAZMAT team).\r\n\r\nThe Hillshire Brands Company has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis.  The Hillshire Brands Company encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company safety meetings, employee participation meetings, training sessions and postings on bulletin bulls.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by The Hillshire Brands Company, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\r\n\r\nThe Hills"
