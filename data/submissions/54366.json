Hiland Partners, LP is committed to the safety and\nhealth of its employees, contractors and visitors. The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation\nand maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and\nmaintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event\nof an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific\nmechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Norse Gas Plant is located 14 miles South of Noonan, North Dakota. It is a plant that\nis designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw\nnatural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane). The only process in the\nplant that contains an above threshold quantity of a regulated substance is the Product Storage Tank. There\nare no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the Norse Gas Plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Norse Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program\nthat consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program. The\nmechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written\nrecommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards\nand past operation history. Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding\nof facility operation and maintenance requirements.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Norse Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have re"

The ERP includes\nthe names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of\nsupport services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory\nagencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance. Liaison with those agencies is maintained to\nensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency\nsituation is high priority.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nHiland Partners, LP believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Hiland continues to look\nfor, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential\nworkplace hazards. Hiland also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and\nimplemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies,\nprograms and procedures is a high priority."
