This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. The following is a statement from Bear Paw Energy Senior Management.  Bear Paw Energy Inc. believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees.  Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures.  Employees of Bear Paw Energy Inc. are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies.  Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\nThe Little Beaver Gas Plant, located in Fallon County, Montana, uses mechanical refrigeration to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, an EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and natural gas condensate).  There is approximately 41,245lbs of Y-Grade in storage.  The Little Beaver plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.  The facility is unmanned.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS"

The plant was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA, API, ASME, and other codes and regulations.  All of our operators have been thoroughly trained in plant operation, safety, process hazards, and emergency response.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  We have had NO reportable accidents in the last five years.  What releases that did occur at the Plant involving regulated substances were controlled quickly and resulted in no off-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion.  Company employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. If an emergency were to occur, the station\u00bfs emergency response plan provides instructions to employees for notification of the local fire authority Fallon County Fire Department, LEPC,  and Sheriff\u00bfs office.\n\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant\u00bfs operation or equipment, changes in receptors, or responders.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBear Paw Energy Inc. recognizes the value of the PSM standard as a way of safely conducting their operations.  Therefore we have implemented the"
