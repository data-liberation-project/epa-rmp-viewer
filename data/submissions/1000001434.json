This facility strives to adhere to all local, state and federal rules and regulations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Sedgwick County Fire Department will be our first responder.  They are notified annually through our Tier Two submissions, as part of the Community-right to-Know regulations.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia plant consists of four tanks: 1-30,000 gallon, 1-26,000 gallon, and 2-12,000 gallon tanks (total 349,520 pounds).  The bulk of our business is selling fertilizer to our crop producers who raise wheat, beans, and milo .  This facility may also have a maximum of 60 nurse tanks that would allow up to 262,140 pounds when filled to 85%.  The total capacity would be 611,660 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case scenario and alternate scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns as outlined in the Homeland Security Act.  All relevant information will be forwarded to the local first responders.   \n\n\nOur employees are trained on a rotational 2-year basis where they attend a state conducted NH3 school.  They receive classroom training as well as a written test.  \n\nOur facility is maintained in accordance with the state of Kansas Department of Agricultures rules and regulations.  We realize that the Kansas Department of Agriculture has not yet adopted the most recent set of ANSI standards.  However, the compnay plans to mee the standard and the company will budget both time and money to insure that all facilities meet the new regulations.  \n\n  Our Emergency Action Plan is shared with the County Fire Department. By definition we do not have an Emergency Response Plan because we require all employees to evacuate the area and call 911 immediately in the event of an accident or release of NH3.\n\nThe Farmers Coop Elevator Company has not experienced an injury or a reportable release in the last five years.\n\nThere are no are no kno"
