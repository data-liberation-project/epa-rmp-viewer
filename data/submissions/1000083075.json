Miniat Foods LLC is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  \r\n\r\n<> The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\r\n\r\nStationary Source:\r\n\r\nThe Miniat Foods LLC, Georgia facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature. Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 7 Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\r\n\r\nMiniat Foods LLC, Carrollton uses one chemical (anhydrous ammonia) that is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  \r\n\r\nThe Carrollton facility includes multiple pieces of equipment in the closed loop refrigeration process. The equipment with the single largest capacity is the low temperature receiver #2.  All equipment is administratively controlle"

Should the scope of any incident exceed the capability of Miniat Foods staff, such as a large flammable gas release, fire, or explosion at the facility, the employee discovering emergency shall follow the protocol provided in the Emergency Response Plan to notify facility personnel, isolate the covered process if safe to do so, evacuate the facility and perform headcount at the designated muster point, and contact emergency responders. The on-site HazMat Team is trained to First Responder Operations Level only; the Carroll County Fire Department HazMat Team provides response for releases beyond the site level of training.\r\n\r\nEmergency exit routes and assembly areas are identified on the evacuation maps located in each work area. In addition, designated assembly areas are identified by signs in the field. Note that there are no facility processes that would require continued operation during an emergency. \r\n\r\nFire extinguishers are available at several locations within the plant site to assist with the response of small, incipient fires. Facility employees should only administer the fire extinguishers if the fire is within the capacity of the extinguisher and if the employee is trained to do so [29 CFR 1910.119(n)]. \r\n\r\nMiniat Foods is equipped with spill-cleanup materials for containment and cleanup of minor spills. \r\n\r\n<> Planned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\r\nMiniat Foods LLC  is committed to improving our safety systems and continues to address recommendations identified in the most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for this covered process. Future changes will be reviewed under the Management of Change (MOC) element and will address potential changes to improve safety as part of the MOC process."
