      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nValero Renewable Fuels, LLC - Fort Dodge (Valero Renewables) is committed to the protection of our employees, the public and the environment.  This is demonstrated through our prevention program which covers areas such as operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated substances.  Valero Renewables carries a written emergency response action plan to assist with accidental releases of hazardous materials. \r\n\r\nProcesses and Regulated Substances\r\nValero Renewables operates an ethanol fuel production plant located in Fort Dodge, Iowa.  The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The facility produces by-products known as dry and wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed as well as bio-oil which is used in the manufacture of biodiesel.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain the following RMP regulated substances:  pentane, isopentane, neopentane (2,2-diemethylpropane), and butane.  Because of the variation in petroleum products like natural gasoline, the composition of regulated substances was determined by using the highest upper bound of each regulated substance reported on suppliers Material Safety Data Sheets and normalized to 100%.  This is a very conservative estimate.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 1,133,598 pounds.  The maximum amount of each regulated substance on site in the natural gasoline is estimated at 76,854 pounds of butane, 336,237 pounds of 2,2-dimethylpropane, 336,237 pounds of isopentane and 384,270 pounds of pentane.  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia store"
