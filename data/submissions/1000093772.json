The worst-case scenarios do not impact any public or community receptors and there have not been any accidents within the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nA.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is Pinon's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Dark Horse facility has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is Pinon's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, the Dark Horse facility has coordinated response activities with the Lea County LEPC and local Fire and Rescue Departments.\n\n\n\nB.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Pinon Dark Horse Facility is a new Sour Gas treatment facility located in Jal, New Mexico.  The products handled are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.  The facility also has one toxic chemical as defined by RMP.\n\n\n\nC.    The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n   a.    Worst Case Toxic Scenario:\n\nFor the worst-case scenario for toxics, it was assumed that the Acid Gas Injection (AGI) pump, P-1595/96, experienced a catastrophic failure resulting in a full discharge for a 20-minute duration.  The amount of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) released was 2,110 lbs. over a 20-minute duration (105 lbs./min.).  ALOHA; (Version 5.4.7), an EPA-sponsored s"

Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s.\n\n\n\n        Worst Case Flammable Scenario:\n\nEPA assumes the worst-case scenario for flammables to be a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) and the RMP submittal must include this information.  For DHTF, it was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (NGL Product Bullet Tank, V-1176) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  ALOHA; was used to calculate a distance of less than 0.1 miles to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.  As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on a release of heptane, the predominant component of the mixture in the sphere.  Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s.  The scenario involved a catastrophic release of 88,600 lbs. (1,840 lbs./min), assuming that the entire mixture was heptane.\n\n\n\n\n\nD.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. This facility meets the eligibility requirements for a RMP Level 1 program.  Additionally, the Pinon Dark Horse facility is a PSM-covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and their representatives are consulted and have access to information regarding all PSM elements. Complete and accurate information on the process technology, process equipment, and ha"

Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP method is used to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of no more than 5 years. All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, the Dark Horse facility maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tag out; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or oth"
