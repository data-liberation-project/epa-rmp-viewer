During the evaluation phase consideration was given to the following items while completing the Risk Management Program:\n\nSafety of personnel both inside and outside of the facility. \n\nSafety of the equipment within the facility.\n\nContinuation of the plant functioning to assure proper treatment of the water.  \n\nProgram Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this program was to aid the operating personnel in developing a program designed to:\n\nEliminate or minimize adverse effects from emergency situations affecting normal operations.\n\nDevelop procedures for properly responding to emergencies.\n\nProvide instruction for system personnel to insure they understand their responsibilities during emergency situations.\n\nProvide inventories of available emergency equipment and outline existing mutual aid agreements and contracts with outside organizations for specialized assistance.\n\nVulnerability Analysis\n\nAs a part of the planning process, a variety of potential natural and manmade emergencies were reviewed, including:\n\nPower Failure\nFlood\nFire \nWindstorm\nExplosion\nEquipment Breakdowns\nDischarge or Intake of Hazardous Chemicals\nPersonnel injury\n\nand others. \n\nIn developing contingency plans, it is necessary to attempt to foresee as many different types of emergencies as possible, but to narrow the list to the ones that are most probable and will have the greatest effect on those in and near the facility. \n\nTo that end, it was the belief of those that were tasked with the development of the Risk Management Program, that an accidental release of the chemicals used in the treatment process would pose the greatest potential and threat. Accidental releases were placed in two categories, minor, which would likely occur during changeover and major, which would be"

While capable, concern was expressed of the ability to control a major release. With inherent limitations, it was believed that in the event of a potential major release, only limited offensive actions could be completed and that prompt notification of the emergency response agencies would be essential to limit potential injury or environmental damage. Quick and proper action by in-plant personnel would limit potential harm."
