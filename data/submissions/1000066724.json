      "SummaryText": "The Facility maintains an ammonia refrigeration system which contains a total of approximately 21,000 pounds of ammonia. The system is a closed loop and little or no ammonia is needed to replenish minor losses due to routine maintenance to sustain three 15 degree F freezers for raw material storage.  Ammonia refrigeration is also used for cooling and humidity control in certain production areas.\n\n\n\nInspections and rounds are made daily to ensure safe operation of the process system.  Automatic controls and interlocks are used to control some system parameters.  Ammonia gas detectors and ventilation are used as additional engineering controls.  Upon activation of the ammonia detection alarm, employees are to evacuate.\n\n\n\nAn emergency action plan has been developed and has been coordinated with the Great Bend Fire Department and the Barton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Facility has an arrangement with the Great Bend Fire Department and Barton County LEPC to provide response in emergencies. The Great Bend Fire Department has been made familiar with the Facility and the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThis system and its safeguards, along with Redbarn employees' professional approach to prevent accidents with this and other chemicals used at their facilty, has proven to be very effective at attaining a recovrd of very few releases and minimal amounts of chemical lost during an emergency event.  Since their startup in 2010, Redbarn has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that resulted in any onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  It is the focus of Redbarn to maintain that record and look into ways to improve the engineering, operations, and training of employees whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
