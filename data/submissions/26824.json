EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 68.155\n\nThe City of Melbourne Utility Department operates the Lake Washington Water Production Facility (LWWPF) for the City of Melbourne, Florida (the City).\n\n1.1ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\n\nThe City LWWPF accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n1.1.1. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (a)(1)\n\nThe City has a management system in place whish oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with the other City policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n\n1.1.2. PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (a)(2)\n\nThe City maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, the elements needed to implement the RMP program, and the like elements in place in the plants' OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in the City's Document Control System (DCS).\n\n1.2 THE CITY OF MELBOURNE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLING AT THE MELBOURNE, FLORIDA SITE (B)\n\nThe City employs 37 full-time employees at the facility and in field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the water production process.\n\n1.2.1 SITE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe new chlorine facilities are housed in a totally enclosed temperature controlled building just south of the new Operations Building.  Both the bulk storage area and control room are within the same building.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the container off-loading area south of the building, the bulk storage area, the control room and the vacuum piping system enclosed in concrete trenches from the north all of the building to various points of injecti"

This PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the standard operating procedure for the facility.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  These programs are coordinated with the City's Fire Department.\n\n1.4.1 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d)(1)\n\nFacility-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.\n\n1.4.2 CHLORINE-SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM (d)(2)\n\n1.4.2.1.Chlorine-Specific Policies and Procedures\n\nChlorine-specific prevention features at the facility include policies and procedures for the operation of the chlorine system.\n\n1.4.2.2.Facility Design\n\nThe new chlorine storage and feed facilities are within an enclosed building.  The storage and control areas are in separate rooms, with a window providing a clear view of the chlorine containers and gas withdrawal system.  Both rooms are subject to a forced-air draft ventilation and exhaust system that maintains a positive pressure in the building at all times..  A heating system is also provided to control temperature during the winter.  Otherwise, the building interior is typically held at ambient temperature levels.\n\nIn addition, several s"

      "SummaryText": "afety features were incorporated into the facility design.  An automatic container shut-off system was provided.  On detection of a chlorine leak, a nitrogen gas powered valve system isolates all containers.  In addition, the overhead roll-up door at the south end of the storage area is provided with an automatic operator that closes the door upon the detection of a leak.  The ventilation system is also interlocked with the alarm system such that it shuts off upon leak detection.  There is also a chlorine gas scrubber system that starts upon leak detection.  This system evacuates the chlorine gas from the building interior and uses sodium hydroxide to render the gas inert prior to its release to the atmosphere.  Finally, the materials of construction used were based on recommendations of the Chlorine Institute standards and guidelines.\n\n1.4.2.3.Equipment Design\n\nThere are two pipe systems, high pressure and vacuum.\n\n1.5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\n\nDuring the last five years, the LWWPF experienced three incidents.  These incidents occurred on the 19th, 23rd, and 25th of November, 2001.  The facility staff initiated the Emergency Response Program during each incident.  No injuries occurred and each incident proved to be the result of equipment failure.  Corrective action was taken immediately to resolve the problem.  No additional incidents have occurred since the corrective action was taken.  In addition, a new facility was constructed and placed into service.  The old facility where the incidents occurred is no longer in use.\n\nThe amount of chlorine lost in each incident was less than 10 pounds, thereby making them non-reportable incidents.  The necessary forms and reports regarding each incident were prepared and are on file at the LWWPF.  Also, a Management of Change was prepared for the corrective action.  This corrective action provided piping system enhancement.\n\n1.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\n\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the City's E"

Currently, the City of Melbourne management and process safety teams are reviewing potential enhancements to the design of the chlorine system, in order to increase safety."
