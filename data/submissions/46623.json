The facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Hull Fertilizer/UAP Distribution Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should and accidental release occur, the facility has orientated and is prepared to work with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee, or other authorities, so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The Primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutirent. The maximum quantity stored would be 261,699 pounds in the facility's 2 bulk tanks and on-site nurse tanks.\n\n3. Accidental release program: The facility complies with the rule and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia equipment, containers and storage facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, or significant property damage on site nor to our knowledge have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering inplace, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n5. The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed wit"
