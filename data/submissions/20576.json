The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa\nAdministrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the\nstorage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is\nreferenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past\nfive years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property\ndamage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site\ndeaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or\nenvironmental damage.  \n\n6.Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.  An written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.   Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and\ncommunity right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III\n(EPCRA);\n\nc.   This facility is included in the Butler County's  Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic\nevaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. \n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage\nor use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."

Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees ofAredale Fram Center (the\nfacility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of\nanhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is\nprepared to work with the Aredale Fire Department, Butler County LEPC, \nor other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to\nthe people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale\nto farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for\ndirect application and for crop production nutrients.  One (1) 30,000 gallon\nAnhydrous Ammonia storage tank is on site. The maximum quantity stored\nat 85% capacity would be 131,146 pounds.    We have Safety and Emergency\nAction Plan in place. We provide our employees with appripriate training for\nhandling Anydrous Ammonia and responding to accidental releases. We \nupdate our Programs periodically as needed. Maintenance is performed as \nneeded and documented in our files.  In order to evaluate potential accidental\nreleases, we performed an off-site consequence analysis using guidance \nfrom the Fertilizer Institute.\n\n3.Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na:     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of\nthe storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum\nquantity released would be 131,146 pounds, which represents the volume of\nthe largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design\nstandards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts\nper million, or ppm) is 2.40 miles.  \n\nb:    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history\n(or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a\n3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an\nautomatic"
