The MWTP has established four levels of events involving the potential for a chlorine leak or an actual chlorine leak.\n\nLEVEL I.\nChlorine containers are being delivered by the vendor or are being installed by plant personnel. Response to small leaks occurring upon connection of container or at other times involves shuttin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      "
