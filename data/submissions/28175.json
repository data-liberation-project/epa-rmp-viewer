By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace and improve the environment.\n\nRisk Management Program\n\nThis facility is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a RMP and submit a Risk Management Plan.  The RMP requirements include submission of the Risk Management Plan, a hazard assessment defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, a description of the accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the RMP for the KNC Barnesville Terminal in Barnesville, MN.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nInitial construction and operation of the Barnesville Terminal began in 1976.  Since that time, several changes, additions and improvements have resulted in the current design of the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia distributed from this facility is used as agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe Barnesville Terminal is a distribution facility for anhydrous ammonia consisting of a 30,000-ton atmospheric storage tank with a secondary containment dike, a 90,000-gallon pressurized ammonia storage vessel, a product heater, refrigeration compressors and assorted vessels and piping.  Propane is used "

The process that includes these substances is subject to the RMP rule as a Program 3 process.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program\n\nIt is KNC?s corporate policy to eliminate accidental releases of any substance, particularly hazardous and regulated materials.  The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this terminal, the safety of its employees and the community.\n\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, KNC is committed to the following:\n\n?    A knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group;\n?    A well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner;\n?    Implementation of a comprehensive Process Safety Management and Prevention Program;\n?    Continual review and improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention;\n?    Excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record; and\n?    Planning, preparation and training for emergency response.\n\nThe Barnesville Terminal has had a written Emergency Response Plan in effect for many years, as required by the RMP and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules.  KNC is committed to implement the plan in response to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.

Employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and appropriate response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Barnesville ammonia terminal is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This rule has required this facility to establish an accident prevention program which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPA?s RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, store or process hazardous materials.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of terminal activities.\n\nThe Barnesville Terminal adheres to the requirements of PSM and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA Prevention Program requirements including routine training and testing of employees and drivers that operate any part of the process, alarms to indicate operating conditions outside the norm, an off-hours phone notification system for abnormal conditions, video monitoring of truck loading/unloading stations and automatic shutdown of ammonia transfer should control parameters fall outside normal conditions.  Additionally, the facility is equipped with terminal perimeter sensors to monitor potential emissions from the facility, continuously.  The facility has addressed the elements of accident prevention included in these programs throughout its years of operation.

KNC?s Barnesville Terminal has an excellent five-year accident record with no RMP reportable releases.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nSynopsis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe hazard assessment element of the RMP rule requires the evaluation of potential off site effects of \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios of regulated substances.\n\nThe EPA has defined a worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a listed chemical from a vessel or process line failure, taking into account passive mitigation and administrative controls.  The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the ?worst-case? scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under ?worst-case? should not be considered a ?public danger zone.? Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a rel"

It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.  Ammonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank, which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike, and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels on the site.\n\nKNC?s hypothetical ?worst-case? scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminal?s 90,000-gallon bullet, administratively controlled to 85% of its volume.  As required by the rule, the ?worst case? release assumes that this entire quantity is released in 10 minutes as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with a release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nWe believe this scenario is the hypothetical ?worst-case? event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process an"

Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the terminal and operator intervention, which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of rail car unloading hoses.  The hoses are assumed to fail due to railcar movement and release ammonia for a few seconds before an excess flow valve stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/PSM Program.  A formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
