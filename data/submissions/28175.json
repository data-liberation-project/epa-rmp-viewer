This rule has required this facility to establish an accident prevention program which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, store or process hazardous materials.

KNC\u00bfs Barnesville Terminal has an excellent five-year accident record with no RMP reportable releases.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nSynopsis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe hazard assessment element of the RMP rule requires the evaluation of potential off site effects of worst-case and alternative release scenarios of regulated substances.\n\nThe EPA has defined a worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a listed chemical from a vessel or process line failure, taking into account passive mitigation and administrative controls.  The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under \u00bfworst-case\u00bf should not be considered a \u00bfpublic danger zone.\u00bf Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a rel"

It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.  Ammonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank, which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike, and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels on the site.\n\nKNC\u00bfs hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminal\u00bfs 90,000-gallon bullet, administratively controlled to 85% of its volume.  As required by the rule, the \u00bfworst case\u00bf release assumes that this entire quantity is released in 10 minutes as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with a release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nWe believe this scenario is the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.

Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the terminal and operator intervention, which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of rail car unloading hoses.  The hoses are assumed to fail due to railcar movement and release ammonia for a few seconds before an excess flow valve stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/PSM Program.  A formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
