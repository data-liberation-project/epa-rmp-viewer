Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The program consists of procedures for responding to a chlorine release. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including (1) proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for human exposures, (2) facility evacuation plans and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, (3) notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and (4) post-incident follow-up requirements. Procedures are in place governing the establishment of the plant's Emergency Operation Center where management personnel can direct and control emergency operations on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn addition, we have procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant facilities or to the chlorine storage and feed process, or when improvement benefits are recognized. Affected personnel are informed about, and trained on, the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) having jurisdiction in Summers and Mercer Counties - and with Lewis County and Weston, West Virginia, emergency management officials. We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g.., contracted chlorine emergency response [HAZMAT] teams, local fire department, police department).

The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan (RMPlan), including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures we have put in place to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\t\tWorst-case Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe worst case scenario at our water treatment facility involves a failure of a ton container holding approximately 2000 lbs of liquefied chlorine gas under pressure, resulting in a release with vaporization of the entire contents of the \tcontainer. In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid inside a completely enclosed chlorine storage room in our water treatment building. The containment provided by the building mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nA sump is provided to collect and contain portions of a liquid release that do not immediately vaporize. In reality, the sump could serve to reduce the vaporization rate of chlorine to the storage room air, and likewise reduce the rate at which chlorine gas is released from the room directly to the outside air. However,\tbecause we based our analysis on a very conservative approach, we did not take credit for the sump as a form of mitigation in reducing the endpoint distance reached off-site.\n\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response. Controls include container design, storage, operation, maintenance and inspection; container repair and emergency response equipment; and personnel training conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, chlorine industry standards and practices, and our company's corpor"

Credit is taken in accordance with EPA's simplified approach for the partial containment of chlorine vapor by the room/building enclosure, which mitigates the release, and also by conservatively figuring the vacuum feed system to fail at a point during a leak. The building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a rual area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\n\nAs in the WCS, we have taken a very conservative approach to determining the ARS endpoint distance off-site. In determining the ARS endpoint distance we have, in this case, taken credit for active mitigation provided by engineered safeguards that include chlorine monitors/detectors that automatically activate an area\talarm in the control room and the vacuum feed system. The chlorine leak detection system is calibrated to initiate alarms at very low concentrations of chlorine (i.e., lower than industry recommended settings). As stated in the description of the WCS, numerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and to provide effective emergency response should one occur.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our site/facility emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

The container storage room can hold up to 4 1-ton cylinders. One cylinder is connected to the same feed piping manifold. An alternate supply arrangement consists of one additional 1-ton cylinders connected to a parallel, but normally isolated, feed piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a gas to the chlorinators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the into the water stream. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS' can be used to help the Summers County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses.

Our systematic, proactive management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\t\tProcess safety information\n\t \tProcess hazard analysis\n\t \tOperating procedures\n\t \tTraining\n\t \tMechanical integrity\n\t\tManagement of change\n\t\tPre-startup review\n\t\tCompliance audits\n\t\t Incident investigation\n\t\t Employee participation\n\t\t Hot work permit\n\t \tContractors\nAs part of our prevention efforts, the following is a list of key safeguards and chlorine-specific accidental release prevention steps that we have implemented at our site:\n\n   A new, state-of-the-art chlorine feed system\n\nInstrumentation and control systems with an emergency power supply designed in accordance with current industry (recognized and generally accepted good engineering) practices\n\n\tCorrosion-resistant equipment components and piping systems\n\n\tProtective devices to prevent the formation of excessive pressure in chlorine \t\tequipment\n\n\tIsolation valves to permit isolation of different parts of the process\n\n\tChlorine monitors/dete"
