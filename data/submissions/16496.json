Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: \n\nThe Boettcher Landing facility serves as a distribution point for agricultural fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by barge and rail and is transloaded to trucks for field delivery.  The facility also supplies anhydrous ammonia by pipeline to the Wilbur-Ellis Company , which is located across the roadway.  With proper care, this valuable fertilizer will be available to the agricultural community when needed at reasonable cost.\n\nPersonnel safety and protection of the environment are of utmost importance.  Safety for our co-workers, the community and environment depends on the proper design, installation, maintenance, and training of our personnel.  It is our policy to comply with all applicable Federal and State regulations and codes.\n\nOur emergency response program is designed to comply with the requirements of several Federal and State codes and regulations.  Listed below are the codes and regulations that are the basis of our emergency response program:\n\nFEDERAL:     \n7 The Code of Federal Regulations 29 CFR 1910.111  Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\n7 The Code of Federal Regulations 33 CFR Part 127  Liquefied Natural Gas Waterfront Facilities\n\nSTATE:\n7 The State of Washington General Safety and Health Standards 296-24-510 Part F-2 Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\n\nInformation used to develop the release prevention and emergency response program were from the following:\n\nUS Department of Health, Education, and Welfare:\n7 Working safely with anhydrous ammonia\n\nManufacturing Chemists Association:\n7 Chemical Safety Data Sheet SD-8 Properties and essential information for safe handling and use of anhydrous ammonia\n\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers:\n7 Emergency response procedures for anhydrous ammonia vapor release\n\nCompressed Gas Association:\n7 CGA G-2 Anhydrous ammonia\n\nThe Fertilizer Institute:\n7 Operational safety manual for anhydrous ammonia\n7"

Audio and visual (strobe light) are utilized to alert river traffic and neighbors.  Forms to document and report releases, for release notification, and for threatening phone calls are included in our plan.\n\n\n2.   Facility description and regulated substances handled:\n\nThis facility is on property leased from the Port of Whitman by the McGregor Company.  The facility is located on the north bank of the Snake River about 0.80 km (= mile) east of where Highway 127 crosses the Snake River and is in the Port of Whitman.  \n\nThe area in general has fertilizer distribution facilities, grain storage, barge loading facilities, agriculture and recreation facility located about 1 mile down river and upwind.  Barges deliver refrigerated ammonia from Unocal's Rivergate, Oregon and Kennewick, Washington storage terminals to Central Ferry.  These barges carry refrigerated anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is off-loaded over a 4 to 15 day period.  If use of ammonia is slow due to weather requirements, the barge may require additional time to discharge.  Barges will be located at the dock during both spring and fall seasons.  Hours of operation are from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. during the spring and fall season.  It is estimated that each season will be 6-10 weeks in duration.\n\nThis facility is designed to receive anhydrous ammonia by river barges.  A marine arm is used to transfer product.  The mooring area at this facility is capable of mooring only one vessel at a time.\n\nThe facility provides receiving piping, an ammon"

All equipment including pumps, piping, valves, heaters, loading arms, storage tanks, meters, electrical and safety is designed to meet all Federal, State, County, and local codes as well as Unocal's and McGregors corporate standards for both safe and environmentally acceptable operations for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nCommunication at the location requires coordination between the McGregor Company site; the Wilbur-Ellis Company site and the off-loading barge.  This communication is accomplished by use of telephones and hand held mobile radios.  During ammonia transfer, all operators are equipped with a radio with a spare available in the office for emergency use.  A minimum of two persons will be on duty while ammonia is being transferred: a barge operator and a shore operator.  When ammonia is being transferred to Wilbur-Ellis a minimum of three operators will be on duty.  There will be an operator at each location.  When ammonia is not being transferred a minimum of one operator will be on duty at all times, while the barge is moored.\n\nBarge pumps deliver the -33.330C (-280F) refrigerated ammonia to a booster pump located shore side.  The booster pump delivers the ammonia through a shell and tube heat exchanger which heats the ammonia to 1.670C (350F).  From the heater, ammonia is delivered to the storage tanks, three (3) truck loading stations, a railcar-loading station and to Wilbur-Ellis.  Ammonia delivered to Wilbur-Ellis Company is a mixture of cold and warm ammonia so that the resultant temperature is about -20.560C (-50F).\n\nThe facility provides an office, a truck weigh scale and storage for diesel to refuel the barges as necessary.  Propane is used as fuel for the two (2) hot water heaters needed to warm the refrigerated anhydrous ammonia from -33.330C (-280F) to 1.670C (350F).\n\nThe operation areas are well lighted and safety equipment is provided throughout the facility.\n\nThe facility does n"

Therefore, the risk of a release into the Snake River is significantly reduced.  In the event of a spill or discharge into the river, the ammonia would be extremely difficult to recover.  Anhydrous ammonia is highly soluble in water.  Due to this solubility, standard mechanical means of containment would be ineffective, and therefore impractical. \n\nAny large ammonia releases near the bullets will be contained in the depressed area to the west of the storage area.\n\nThe regulated substances at this facility are anhydrous ammonia (refrigerated and pressure) and propane.\n\nThe amount of anhydrous ammonia and propane stored at this facility exceed the threshold quantities established by Federal EPA.  Refrigerated ammonia is stored on the barge and pressurized ammonia in two (2) pressure tanks.  The propane is stored in five (5) pressure storage tanks.\n\n\n3.
