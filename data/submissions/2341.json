THE COMPANY PRIMARILY SELLS ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AS FERTILIZER FOR CROP IMPROVEMENT.\n\nTHE PLANT CONSIST OF THREE TANKS,  (ONE 30,000, ONE 26,000 AND ONE 12,000 GALLON)  WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 298,000 POUNDS.  THE PLANT IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED WITH STRICT ADHERANCE WITH ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  OUR FACILITY IS INSPECTED EACH YEAR BY THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND WE COMPLY WITH THEIR REQUESTS FOR PLANT IMPROVEMENT.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 131,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 2.5 MILES, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 800 AREA RESIDENTS.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AREA ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS, IN SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES.  THE EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS.  EMPLOYEES ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS MADE AVAILABLE DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.\n\nTHIS COMPANY'S EXCELLENT TRAINING RECORD IS THE REASON WHY WE CAN REPORT THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURED AT THE STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS SHARED AND DISCUSSED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY'VE  AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA."
