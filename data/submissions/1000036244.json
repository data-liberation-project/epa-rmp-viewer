The prevention program includes assuring all process equipment and materials meet appropriate standards and code requirements, implementation of detailed safe operating procedures, and effective mechanical integrity program, and an extensive training program to assure that all personnel are thoroughly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia system. Process controls include relief valves, check valves, automatic and manual shutoffs, excess flow devices, emergency power source, interlocks, alarms and procedures. Sudden surges in flow or pressure will cause strategically located automatic shutoff valves to close and isolate the system. Water fogging sprays located at relief valves and unloading station can be automatically activated by area monitoring devices triggered at preset concentration limits or manually activated by control room operators or storage facility operators. Area at storage facility is graded to contain runoff",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nEnvironmental protection and enhancement are essential elements of TVA's integrated resource management\n\nmission. TVA exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its unified river and power system for\n\nmultiple public benefits, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power. TVA is committed to setting\n\nthe standard for environmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the Tennessee Valley\n\na model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management. TVA assures that employees\n\nare aware of their environmental responsibilities, use effective environmental processes, and are held accountable for\n\nperformance.\n\n\n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements\n\nand striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties. We will assure environmental\n\nprotection and reduce risks to our employees and communities in which we operate through proper environmental\n\nreview of new developments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness. All\n\nactivities will be conducted in accordance with current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe affected facility consists of an anhydrous ammonia storage facility including two 18,000 gallon storage tanks with\n\nsupporting unloading equipment, liquid transfer pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert\n\nammonia from a liquid to a vapor, an ammonia vapor transport line, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject\n\nammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\n\n\n\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia.

Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and\n\nmitigation measures to limit the distances to the end point for each reported scenario, were developed. To perform\n\nthe required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the very conservative EPA RMP'Comp model was used.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 18,000 gallon storage tank. A maximum\n\nrelease of 81,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period was considered. The released quantity has\n\nnot been limited by a system of administrative controls. Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F\n\nstability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite end point concentrations impacting populated\n\nareas.\n\n\n\nThe alternative case release scenario with the worst credible case offsite impact involves the release of 78,000\n\npounds of ammonia vapor loss from the failure of a pressure safety valve to reseat or from ruptured vapor piping.\n\nUnder typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have\n\noffsite toxic end point levels.\n\n\n\nIV. Description of Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - TVA maintains documentation of safety information concerning chemical hazards,\n\noperating parameters, and equipment designs and specifications associated with the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - TVA conducted comprehensive analyses of the process to ensure that hazards\n\nassociated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The Hazardous and Operability Study\n\n(HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted\n\nby a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering,"

The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup, normal\n\nshutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or\n\nemergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the\n\nprocess and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\n\n\nTraining - TVA's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the\n\noperation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process\n\nand knowledgeable of the hazards of the process. The personnel are provided with refresher training at least every\n\nthree years or more often if needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - TVA conducts well documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe\n\nand reliable operations. All process equipment routinely checked includes storage tanks and pressure vessels,\n\npiping systems, relief and venting systems, controls and pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and monitoring\n\ndevices. All maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified personnel who\n\nhave had proper training. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and\n\nsafely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - TVA maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment,\n\nprocedures and monitoring technology which assures that any changes meet regulatory requirements.

The audits will be conducted at least every 3 years\n\nand any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations - Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.
