The facility has installed an isobutane and propane storage tanks and process equipment according to NFPA-58 and ASME standards.  The facility's policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy and procedure to call the Nelson Co. Fire Department.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Discussion:\n\nThe facility stores propane in an 18,000 gallon above ground tank with a maximum fill of 16,200 gallons (90% capacity).  In addition, the facility has installed a second gas storage tank with a shell capacity of 10,000 gallons of isobutane (maximum fill 90%).  This new system mirrors the existing tank unloading system; delivery pumps and piping; and connection to the high pressure pumps in the pump and valve room.  Both materials are used as a blowing agent to produce expanded foam packing material.   Isobuatane and propane are extremely flammable and the facility has taken a number of steps to insure that the process is both maintained and operated in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps:\n\nThe installation of this process line in 1996 and 2009 was according to NFPA 58 and ASME tank standards.  The storage tanks and piping are located inside a chain link fence security area.  Installation included the use of mechanical and electrical equipment specifically designed for liquefied natural gas service.  This system and components were reviewed by the Kentucky State Fire Marshall's office and all safety recommendations have been installed.  Numerous safety sensors have been installed in this process and include the following: 6 gas sensors that automatically shut down the process if gas is detected anywhere in the process or storage area; redundant mechanical and automatic shutoff that shutdown and isolate the system if there is any of the following conditions present:"

The local responding agencies have reviewed the facility's system and conducted onsite awareness and inspection tours.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - None at present.\n\n"
