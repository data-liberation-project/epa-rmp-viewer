Barber Foods is committed to operating its Milliken Street facility in Portland, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  Barber has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases.  Barber has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant to respond to potential releases.\n\nB.  Barber operates a chicken slicing, cold storage, and distribution facility at 56 Milliken Street in Portland, Maine.  Barber\u00bfs Milliken Street facility houses all of Barber\u00bfs corporate offices, a chicken slicing area, cold storage and dry storage areas, and a refrigerated loading dock.  Chicken that is sliced at Milliken Street is then trucked to the St. John Street location in Portland, Maine for breading, frying, stuffing, processing, etc.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system to maintain the cold storage area, refrigerated dock, cooler, and tempering room.   The ammonia refrigeration system is a \u00bfclosed-loop\u00bf system that extends throughout Barber\u00bfs facility.  There are three main anhydrous ammonia storage vessels at Barber, including a high pressure receiver, a storage freezer pumped recirculator, and an intercooler.\n\nC. The facility is subject to the Prevention Program 3 and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for the ammonia refrigeration system.  These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; Trade Secrets; Emergency Response and Planning; and Compliance Audits.\n\nD. This is a new facility; therefore, there have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nE. The facility has trained"
