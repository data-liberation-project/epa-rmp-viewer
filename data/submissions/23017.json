      "SummaryText": "1.0\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n1.1\tSOURCE\r\nThe Prairie Farms Dairy in Peoria, Illinois is submitting a \"predictive filing\" to address the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because its refrigeration system, which contains anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) may exceed the 10,000 pound threshold in the future.  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store milk and related dairy products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 9,770 pounds (i.e., 1,900 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 125 psig and can contain as much as 4,800 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of approximately 90%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains about 3,100 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  The Peoria plant is located in a urban setting.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Peoria plant is a single-stage system consisting of a discharge (high pressure) side and a suction side.  The reciprocating compressors draw suction from the suction accumulator (trap) at about 25 psig.  This accumulator receives suction gas from th"

Ammonia liquid which collects in the accumulator is returned to the liquid line by a pumper drum.  The major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) enters three (3) roof-mounted condensers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and for operation of the pumper drum.  The condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the refrigeration equipment.\r\n\r\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.   These include pressure relief valves and safety interlocks.  Pressure relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drum, suction accumulators and other pressure vessels, and suction lines from overpressurization.  Safety valves are also used in back pressure valve bypasses (i.e., tanks and silos).  Safety interlocks include high pressure, low pressure, and oil pressure cut-outs for the compressors, as well as high level floats for the suction trap.  The first level float turns off the king valve to reduce the amount of liquid going to the system and returning to the trap.  The second float sounds an alarm in the control room and plant, and shuts off the compressors.  The high pressure cut-out for each compressor is set at 250 to 275 psig.  A system high pressure alarm sounds at 195 psig and turns off all compressors when the high side pressure exceeds 200 psig on the Mercoid controls or 210 psig on the PLC.  The Mercoid controller must be manually reset.  An alarm also occurs if the PLC monitors greater than 40 psig suction pressure for at least 5 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact emp"

This endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\r\n\r\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in the USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (the \"Model Plan\"), dated May 2000.  This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct \"lookup\" tables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint distance.\r\n\r\n2.1\tWORST-CASE RELEASE\r\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the high pressure receiver (approximately 4,800 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release is estimated to be 4,800 feet or 0.88 mile.\r\n\r\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high accumulator is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The vessel was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National \r\n\r\nBoard).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs"

In addition, the vessel is visually inspected daily.\r\n\r\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment of the receiver:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase uncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the vessel wall due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.\r\n\r\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such pressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation from a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRV continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  The SRVs are scheduled to be replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\r\n\r\nFurther, rupture of the vessel from the outside as a result of inadvertent vehicular contact is unlikely since the unit is protected by guard posts.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\r\n\r\n* The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\r\n\r\n* Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of this ve"

This release is representative of a small pipe or vessel leak.  It would also be representative of a flange leak or pump seal  failure.  Because the high pressure receiver and some piping are located outdoors, passive (building) mitigation1 was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the endpoint.  Active mitigation2 was considered, because it is believed that emergency responders could identify and stop the leak in less than 60 minutes.  However, reducing the release duration does not change the TEP distance obtained from the Model plan.  \r\n\r\nUsing the specified meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance to the endpoint for the \"more likely\" release scenario was estimated to be 528 feet or 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\r\n\r\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\r\n\r\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).

The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, \r\n\r\nshutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\r\n\r\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \r\n\r\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\n* Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  \r\n\r\n* Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implem"

The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\r\n\r\n1\tPassive mitigation means equipment, devices, and technologies that function without human, mechanical, or other energy input.  Examples include enclosures (e.g., buildings) for compressed gases and secondary containment dikes for liquids.\r\n2\tActive mitigation means equipment, devices, or technologies that require human, mechanical, or other energy input to function.  Active mitigation for compressed gases, like ammonia, may include automatic shut-off valves, rapid transfer systems, and scrubbers."
