Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Soledad has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68 of the Clean Air Act. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Soledad is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.\n\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Soledad staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, for safely storing anhydrous ammonia, conducting anhydrous mixing operations to produce liquid fertilizer.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Soledad has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Conversion System. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Soledad policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the conversion of anhydrous ammonia to liquid fertilizer, storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 18,000 gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site. The\n\nmaximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 84,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary. Please refer to the Hazard Assessment report for the results of this analysis.\n\n\n\n-Risk Considerations\n\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalation hazard; and thus, the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the "

The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\n\n\n\n -The history of the Wilbur-Ellis Company, Soledad (i.e., no CalARP-reportable anhydrous or aqueous ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Soledad to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nThe facility's maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 84,000 pounds (lb). Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lb threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM. The 500 lb state threshold for the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program is also exceeded. As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 and EPA RMP Program Level 3.\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n-Process Safety Information\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-Operating Procedures\n\n-Training\n\n-Mechanical Integrity\n\n-Management of Change\n\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n-Compliance Audits\n\n-Incident Investigation\n\n-Employee Participation\n\n-Hot Work Permit\n\n-Contractors\n\n\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Business Emergency Plan.\n\n\n\n5.

External Events Analysis Information\n\n\n\nDuring the December 2014 PHA a broad list of external events was considered by the Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed. The External Events that\n\nwere considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, and vehicle impact.  The magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were qualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team.\n\n\n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is committed to continuously making safety improvements and plans to implement the following improvements over the next 24-36 months: \n\n\n\n1. Developing a more comprehensive anhydrous ammonia inspection checklist for the system to better evaluate the mechanical integrity of the tanks, valves, piping, etc. At a minimum, inspection frequencies will follow industry standards. \n\n2. Implementing a facility wide comprehensive corrective action/preventative action (CAPA) log to track and facilitate completion of listed CAs on a timely basis.\n\n3. Seismic stability improvements:\n\n-reinforce saddles \n\n-permanent reinforced anchor support for reactor equipment & pipe rack\n\n-piping tie down support at intervals of 25 feet or less\n\n\n\n4. Continuous evaluation of contractor safety \n\n\n\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance.
