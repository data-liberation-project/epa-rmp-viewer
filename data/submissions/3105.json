Each employee receives annual safety training to reinforce the policies and proceedures.\n\nThe Neville Island Treatment Facility utilizes chlorine for disinfection purposes prior to releasing treated water into the distribution system.  At any one time, the facility may have up to ten (10) one-ton containers on site, stored within a specified enclosure.  Typically, two (2) containers are on-line while two (2) containers are on stand-by for change over or back-up purposes.\n\nIn accordance with the Risk Management Plan Regulation, the worst case release scenario was identified was a catastophic release of the entire contents of one (1) container over a ten minute period.  The results contained herein are based upon the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance published May 24, 1996 for the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe West View Water Authority is proud of the fact that there have been no accidental releases of chlorine gas for more than five years.\n\nIn case of accidental release, personnel have been trained, public notification systems are in place, and response actions have been coordinated with local emergency responders to minimize the potential effects of such an occurance."
