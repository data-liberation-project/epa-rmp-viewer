Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nSweetwater Authority senior management is not only committed to offer a superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program which promotes a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding community.  The Safety Coordinator administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Safety Coordinator periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nB.     Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Sweetwater Authority facility uses a chlorine system to treat water.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to purify the water.  The chlorine is delivered to the facility in one ton containers, which are then connected to the water treatment system, as needed.  The liquid chlorine leaves the one ton containers and enters the evaporators, which turn the liquid chlorine into a gas.  The chlorine gas then proceeds to the chlorinators, where it is pulled into the injectors, which then sends the chlorine into the water distribution system.\n\n\n\nIn the Chlorine Storage Room at Sweetwater Authority there are two chlorine tanks connected to the chlorine system (only one is used at a time).  The controller in the Chlorine Storage Room monitors the weight of each one ton chlorine container.  When the tank in operation is close to empty, the controller shuts off the valve connected to that tank and opens the valve connected to the full tank.  The empty tank is then replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by Sweetwater Authority operators using the monorail hoist.\n\n\n\nThe maximum total chlorine inventory i"

The aqueous ammonia is stored in a 6,000-gallon storage tank, which is located within a containment berm.  Two feed pumps are used to draw aqueous ammonia from the Storage Tank, which is then transferred to the effluent for water treatment.\n\n\n\nThe maximum total inventory of up to 29% aqueous ammonia is 46,260 pounds (6,000 gallons). \n\n\n\nC.     Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nChlorine System\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the chlorine water treatment system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Level 3; and\n\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Sweetwater Authority to prevent the accidental release of chlorine from the facility. The Operating Procedures program ensures that the chlorine system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the chlorine system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before chlorine is first introduced into a new or modified process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Sweetwater Authority's employees and contractors perform hot work"

      "SummaryText": " (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of chlorine and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  Chlorine gas detectors are located in the Chlorine Storage Room, the Chlorinator Room, the Chlorine Dioxide Room, Chlorine Dioxide Day Tank Area, and the lower staircase.  There are also smoke and heat detectors located throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nAqueous Ammonia System\n\n\n\nThe storage of aqueous ammonia at the Sweetwater Authority facility is governed by many safety features.  Much of the safety of the process is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program 1.  The aqueous ammonia system is checked by operators on a daily basis.\n\n\n\nSweetwater Authority maintains tight control of its aqueous ammonia system through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there is a containment basin surrounding the aqueous ammonia tank that can hold more than 144% of the tank's liquid capacity.\n\n\n\nD.     Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nChlorine System\n\n\n\nBased on the abov"

However, there was one incident that resulted in an internal incident investigation as follows:\n\n\n\nA valve was stuck on the chlorine system and Sweetwater Authority called a chlorine contractor in order to isolate the line and replace the valve.  When the contractor disconnected the valve, a small amount of chlorine was released.  The contractor was wearing a cartridge respirator.  Employees of Sweetwater Authority are required to utilize supplied air when they are conducting heavy maintenance on the system.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nChlorine System\n\n\n\nIn September 1994, the chlorine system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).

An equipment list review;\n\n?    A detailed review of any changes to the chlorine system since the 2009 study (reviewed Management of Change Records);\n\n?    A discussion of any releases of chlorine since the 2009 study (review of Incident Investigation Records);\n\n?    Development of HAZOP log sheets;\n\n?    Completion of Emergency Response, Chlorine Checklist, Chlorine What-If Questions, and External Events checklists; and\n\n?    A facility inspection.\n\n\n\nThe mitigation measures included enhanced emergency response and operating procedures.  All recommendations resulting from the revalidation study are due to be completed by January 2015.\n\n\n\nAqueous Ammonia System\n\n\n\nMitigation measures to prevent accidents involving aqueous ammonia include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures. The Sweetwater Authority safety review committee is planning to meet annually, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
