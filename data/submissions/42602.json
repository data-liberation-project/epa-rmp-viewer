      "SummaryText": "The Purolite Company is a ion exchange resin manufacturer located in the NE Philadelphia area near Kensington.  The facility maintains a work force of approximately 75 employees, in shifts operating around the clock.  Raw chemical materials used in the process include liquid monomers, strong acids and bases.  There is a low risk of fire or explosion resulting from the process monomers used, and there is some potential for process acids to upset and react with surrounding elements to form acid vapor.\n\nIn accordance with good safety practice, Purolite maintains a HAZMAT spill team for spill events that may result in non-catastrophic instances.  This would include most events envisioned to occur on our facility.  However, in the event of a catastrophic episode, including serious fire, explosion, or sabotage, Purolite will rely on the emergency services of the Philadelphia Fire Department.  The duties of the HAZMAT Spill Team are identified in the site Safety Manual and the site Prevention, Preparedness and Contingency (PPC) Plan filed on site and with the Philadelphia Fire Department HAZMAT Administration Unit, the Philadelphia Water Department, the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management, and PADEP.  We will perform annual training on the roles of the HAZMAT Spill Team, as well as emergency planning that would go into effect in the event of a catastrophic event, as outlined in the PPC Plan.\n\nOur facility has several potential means for raw materials releases.  None are considered potentially catastrophic in scope.  Employee error may create a potential for quantities of monomers or acids / bases to be discharged to the ground.  In all cases, the releases will be contained by dikes, sumps or concrete trenches, and provide for Spill Team remediation.  Acids may be discharged when process equipment fails.  The acids' corrosive nature impact the viable life of much of our process equipment, and it is within our Maintenance Department's routine work to replace leaking "

Another possibility is for a vendor raw materials delivery to result in a spill due to human error or equipment malfunction.  All deliveries are received in an area that would result in diked containment upon any potential release, and at all times, the vendor driver and a Purolite tanker expert is on hand to witness the deliveries. \n\nSpecific to the only on-site RMP-recognized hazardous substance oleum (fuming sulfuric acid), this product is stored in a contained / diked area, away from any processes or water.  By oleum's nature, it does not attack the vessel walls or piping that contains it, and represents a reaction hazard only once it's introduced to the cation resin process or water.  Limited quantities of oleum are transferred from the storage tank to a temporary head or feed tank in the cation process area.  At any given time, there may be 950 gallons or 15,850 pounds of oleum in the head tank.  The oleum is transferred to either of two glass-lined vessels called sulfonators where it reacts with and is absorbed by copolymer beads to make a cation resin.  Rarely do these units incur any leak of consequence; whenever any leak is detected, the vessels are pumped out to other service vessels and placed out-of-service for immediate repair.  \n\nThere are two areas where a catastrophic release or leak could occur: \n\n      BULK STORAGE TANK RUPTURE.  The release would be fully contained inside the dike walls.  The oleum would be pumped to either a holding tank or a waste tanker for disposal should a leak of this magnitude occur.  Some fumes would release in the storage area, but it is isolated and would provide some containment until clean up was achieved.   \n      OLEUM HEAD TANK OR SULFONATOR FAILURE.  These tanks are inspected every 6 months and any conceivable failure would be a leak as opposed to a tank failure or rupture.  Leaks would be contai"

Any line leak would be isolated by valving off the line and draining the damaged line segment to a secure vessel.  Leaks in the processing area would be subject to contact with water and would liberate some sulfuric fumes should that happen.  On-site spill remediation can quickly neutralize and remove such quantities of oleum.\n\nA leak of more than 20 gallons in the process area is completely unlikely unless it were the result of significant human error or an act of sabotage.\n\nIn the past five years, only one sulfuric acid fume release occurred as a result of the oleum supply.  In this case, the oleum was \"dropped\" from the head tank to a sulfonator containing copolymer beads of unusually high moisture content.  The oleum reacted with the moisture on the beads and rapidly reacted, causing an exothermic boil over.  The \"exotherm\" back flowed up the head tank feed line, and the extreme heat from the reaction melted the line.  There was a resultant sulfuric fume release (ambient pressure) of approximately fifteen minutes.  This release was immediately reported to the proper authorities along with follow-up documentation and corrective actions.  Long-term preventative corrective action was implemented.\n\nIn the event of emergency response, we utilize the services of the Philadelphia Fire Department.  The Fire Department has standing orders not to respond to the emergency until a qualified Purolite employee can inform them of the nature of the emergency.  (In an extraordinary case where exposed oleum may exist, water may not be a suitable means to fight a fire, for instance.)  The facility is fitted with both a wet and dry sprinkler system that should handle any fires in early stages.  Otherwise, a fully engaged fire can be fought with water as long as the oleum tank integrity has not been compromised.  Site fire alarms feed directly to the fire department via an active sensing system"

If an emergency is truly of the magnitude that the fire department will be engaged, then Purolite employees are supplied instructions to shut all systems down and exit the building to a designated rendezvous area.  All employees are knowledgeable in shut down procedures, as we routinely shutdown processes for repairs and semi-annual plant wide shutdowns.  There are only a limited number of residences within the 0.2 mile radius of our facility.  Should we have a release of any consequence, we have Citizen Community contacts in the only nearby community that would need to be notified thereof.\n\nIn the first half of 2005, there will be HAZMAT Spill Team training, outside HAZMAT compliance training, and emergency response reviews.  These programs are repeated on an annual basis."
