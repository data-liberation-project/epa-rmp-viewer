The lead person or supervisor of the affected area, Human Resources, or maintenance personnel are to contact the Primary Incident Commander (IC). If the Primary IC is not available, the alternate IC shall be notified next.  The IC will determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action and should activate the evacuation alarm if necessary.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, first determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area.   The use of a blow horn and/or alarm horn/strobe will inform employees that they are to evacuate the building.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor. Facility map identifying exit doors, evacuation routes and assembly areas are posted at various locations throughout the facility.  Once everyone has evacuated the facility and arrived at their designated meeting area, a head count must be conducted by the evacuation coordinators to account for missing people, including visitors and/or contractors in his/her area.  A daily crew/employee list shall be maintained for each department within the facility. Ten minutes will be allowed for critical unit operators to shutdown their equipment and reach the designated meeting location before attendance will be reported.  \n\nRegarding the worst case scenario assessment, the North Engine Room has a maximum intended inventory of 14,364 lbs completely full.  The worst case scenario is assuming the maximum charge of ammonia in the North Engine Room is released."
