The  operations of the Hershey Creamery Company shall be conducted with the highest regard for the safety and health of its employees.  It is therefore reasonable to expect every employee to accept the responsibility of being a conscious safe worker and to commonly practice safe work habits while on the job and work place.  Thus to accomplish this mission, and a successful safety program, the active cooperation of every person/employee is absolutely essential.  To clearly convey the company's commitment to safety a Policies and Procedures Manual has be developed.\n\nThe Hershey Creamery Company manufactures ice cream and other frozen desserts.  The manufacturing process utilizes a typical ammonia refrigeration system to cool, freeze, preserve and store its raw materals and products.  The main manufacturing facility is located at 301 South Cameron Street, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  The company also owns and operates a refrigerated warehouse at 1200 Airport Industrial Drive, Middletown, Pennsylvania.  The refrigeration system in Middletown typicaly contains 10 tons of ammonia gas that has been liquified under pressure.  The facility is typically staffed 24-hours each day with most of the operations taking place during the first shift.  The facility employes 13 people full time.\n\nAs required by the EPA the \"Worst Case Release Scenario\" was modeled as a catastrophic rupture of  the main receiver with complete loss of contents (19,956 lbs.).  For the \"Alternative Release Scenario\" a small tank puncture was chosen yealding a release of 2,360 lbs. of ammonia over a 20-minute period.  The EPA's RMP*Comp computer model was used to estimate the distance travled by the plume to reach the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm).  The RMP*Comp program gives a distance of 2."
