The maximum quantity released is based on 85% of the capacity of the largest vessel on site as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles is based on the EPA\u00bfs RMP-Comp Program (version 1.07).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in planning for emergencies. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of anhydrous ammonia during the last 5 years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self-closing excess flow valves, so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is rounded to 0.1 mile per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CRF 1910.111 \u00bfStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf.  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of anhydrous ammonia and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to:  Excess flow valves at rises; barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles; and lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.
