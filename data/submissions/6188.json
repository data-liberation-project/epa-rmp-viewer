BallPark Brands operations include the processing of meat products (hot dogs,  hams and deli meats) for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names of BallPark and West Virginia Brand.  BallPark Brands has been in operation at this facility for over 30 years providing quality meat products and over 300 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nBallPark Brands is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is BallPark Brands policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nBallPark Brands seeks to protect and enhance the quality of our environment by including environmental consideration as an integral part of the corporation's overall management.  Our mission is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations by continually reviewing products and packaging, by conducting on-site environmental appraisals and by implementing action where necessary.  We will continuously improve to reduce waste from raw material conversion to finished goods, energy and water consumption, and paper used in the information process.  Whenever practical, we will use recycled or recyclable materials.  We will encourage our employees to practice recycling and conservation"

As technology advances we will continue to revise policies and standards for the corporation, beyond applicable laws and regulations, to effectively meet the expectations of our consumers, employees, neighbors, and stockholders.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nBallPark Brands is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  BallPark Brands uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 80,000-ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants.  BallPark Brands refrigeration system consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping can contain an average amount of 21,870 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, BallPark Brands has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  BallPark Brand's worst case release scenario would be the rupture of the largest single receiver when filled to 75% capacity (the maximum tank capacity limited by engineering controls) over a 10-minute period.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint extends offsite and includes public receptors.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.  During normal operations, BallPark Brands maintains the receivers at 40% capacity.  Only during pump-down operations do the receivers have the potential to be filled to 75% of capacity.  The receivers are operated in pump-down mode once during the year"

These analyses were conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  The most likely release scenario identified by BallPark Brands would be an evaporator impact from a forklift, causing a pipe rupture.  The release would occur inside the loading dock area.   In developing the release parameters of the scenario, BallPark Brands considered the average response time of BallPark Brands Emergency Response Team to shut down the system.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, And Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, BallPark Brands has implemented several precautionary measures, such as process/equipment controls, standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and audit programs.  \n\nBallPark Brands has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant OSHA and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, check valves, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, purge system, and electrical distribution system grounding).

BallPark Brands encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant through postings on bulletin boards, on-site television presentations and through formation of safety committees. Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by BallPark Brands, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nBallPark Brands understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore BallPark Brands has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the refrigeration system.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system, components inspections and tests are conducted on an annual basis by a third party contractor specializing in refrigeration systems.\n\nTo ensure that BallPark Brands control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n7 In accordance with the PSM program, BallPark Brands conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n7 BallPark"

This program is fully described in a document entitled \"Emergency Action Plan\", \"Plant Emergency Organization\", and \"City of Philadelphia Emergency Planning Guide\" in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of off-site releases of anhydrous ammonia.
