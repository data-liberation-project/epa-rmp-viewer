If an accidental release\nwould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other\nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\n  2. Facility Information.\n\n       - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n       - Anhydrous ammonia is stored for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n       - The maximum quantity at the facility would be 140,000 pounds stored in the 30,000\ngallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the 140,000 pounds in the storage tank.\n\n  3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank.   The distance to the\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.16 miles.\n\n       b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a\nrelease from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.\n   \n  4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous\nammonia\".  \n\n  5. The Five-year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five\nyears that:\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries,"

The emergency response program.\n\n     - The facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and\ncommunity right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n  7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
