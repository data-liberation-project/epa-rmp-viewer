The original PHA conducted 12/1994 covers the entire storage facility.  Many safety features are integrated throughout.  These features include pumps equipped with tandem seals and seal failure alarms; a flare and vent system designed to protect equipment from overpressure during upsets by diverting excess volumes and incinerating them; emergency shutdown systems with isolation valves; automated control and shutdown instrumentation; and hydrocarbon detection systems.",
