The PSM Manual includes a description of how the Compliance Audit element is implemented in Section 16.0;\n\n(xiv) Trade Secrets ? There are no Trade Secret issues at the unit.\n\nAdditionally, given that the unit is Eastman-operated, Eastman policies are also applied at the unit. The Eastman Longview operations utilize a ?layers of protection? approach to protect people and the environment. This approach includes, but is not limited to, the following elements:\n\nDesigning for Safety:\n\n- Storage tanks, vessels, and equipment are designed and constructed to strict industry and government standards.\n\n- Process design and operations are analyzed for safety prior to their installation, and periodically thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard.\n\n- Control systems and instruments provide continuous monitoring of operating conditions and alarm operators of upset conditions.\n\n- Emergency shutdown systems automatically shut down operations to a safe state if emergency conditions develop.\n\n- Area and equipment are protected by automatic deluge systems to cool the equipment in the event of a fire and disperse flammable vapors in the event of leaks.\n\n- Combustible gas monitors are installed in critical locations to sound an alarm and turn on the deluge systems in the event of leaks.\n\n- Remotely operated isolation valves are installed in critical locations to allow quick shutdown and isolation of leaks.\n\n- Storage tanks and process equipment are equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent rupture.\n\n- A protective cap covers titanium tetrachloride cylinder valves at all times when the cylinders are not in use.\n\nOperating Safely:\n\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are trained and qualified in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.\n\n- Standard written operating procedures are developed and used by operations personnel.\n\nMaintaining Safe Operations / Auditing Operations:\n\n- Storage tanks, vessels, and equipment are inspected on a regular basis.\n\n- Numerous mechanical integrity and preventative maintenance programs are in place to ensure that equipment is in sound working condition. These include an extensive piping and equipment corrosion and vibration inspection and correction program.\n\n- Both internal and corporate audits are conducted on a regular schedule to help ensure compliance with company safety procedures and regulations.\n\n- OSHA is invited into the Texas Operations facility periodically to conduct VPP inspections to continue Texas Operations? designation as an OSHA VPP Star Site.\n\nTraining:\n\n- Operators are initially trained on the specifics of the process they will be running. Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n\n- New Operators and Maintenance Mechanics take an Extensive Apprenticeship Training Program. This program covers six crafts and is registered by the U.S. Department of Labor. Each trainee completes 367 to 506 hours of Related Instruction and another 5,000 to 6,000 of On-The-Job Learning, depending on the craft.\n\n- Contract employees are required to have OSHA mandated training prior to performing work at Texas Operations. In addition, Texas Eastman Operations provides a site-specific contractor Safety and Health orientation for all contractors employed at the work site.\n\nIn addition to the above elements, Texas Operations is an OSHA Volunteer Star site in the federal OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). VPP is a cooperative program between employers and OSHA to improve worker safety and recognize outstanding safety performance and programs. Texas Operations is one of fewer than 400 sites nationwide to qualify for Star status. To maintain Star status, Texas Operations must meet specific safety performance measures and pass an OSHA VPP inspection every few years.\n\nThe dates of most recent activities reflected in this plan submission are the most recent occurrence as of October 10, 2019.",

A written and specific Emergency Response Plan coordinated with local officials is in place for the facility. The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nEastman maintains a comprehensive site emergency response plan. Employees train annually on the plan as they prepare for a plant wide drill. Key elements of the emergency response plan as it relates to the community emergency response include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n?    Eastman maintains an emergency response team whose members are specifically trained and equipped to respond to emergencies such as leaks, spills, fires, etc. \n\n?    Eastman emergency response personnel use a computerized modeling system to predict the concentration and location of any vapor cloud resulting from a hazardous vapor release using real time weather information. \n\n?
