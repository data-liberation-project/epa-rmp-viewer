Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nTaylor Farms California conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\r\n\r\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\r\n\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nTaylor Farms California uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Drawings in Chapter 8 - Appendix 8.1 show the facility location map and site plan.\r\nTaylor Farms California has over 10,000 lbs. of ammonia in any single refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in product storage cooling, vacuum cooling, and water chilling operations. There are four (4) separate standalone refrigeration systems at the facility. These processes are (1) Main System, (1) 12-Palette Vacuum Cooling System, and (2) 24-Palette Vacuum Cooling Systems. Only Main System has ammonia quantity that is above federal threshold quantity.

Main System is composed of fixed and portable equipment. Fixed equipment includes high- and low-pressure receivers, screw compressor and reciprocating compressor packages, cold room evaporators, evaporative condensers, ammonia pumps, plate frame heat exchangers w/ surge drums on top, ammonia detection, control systems, and diffusion tank. Portable equipment includes falling film water chillers and one refrigeration trailer (R-0816) that are connected to the Main System. The refrigeration trailer consists of reciprocating compressors, high- and low-pressure receivers, ammonia pumps and the evaporative condenser. Main System is operated seasonally from April to November. At the end of the season, portable equipment ships to Yuma, AZ facility for winter operations, from November to April. The ammonia charge of the Main System including the portable equipment is approximately 35,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nVacuum Cooling Systems: 12-Palette (Half Car) Vacuum Cooling System (R-0401 & T-0401) is composed of a Vacuum Tube (T-0401), Refrigeration Trailer (R-0401) and Vacuum Pump. This system has approximately 2,799 lbs. of ammonia.

Approximate ammonia charge of this system is 2,893 lbs. R-24 high-side trailer comprises of a screw compressor, a high-pressure receiver, and an evaporative condenser. VP-71 low-side refrigeration trailer comprises of a low-pressure receiver, ammonia pumps, and vacuum pumps.\r\n\r\nFacility operates seasonally from approximately April 15 through November 15. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the Main System to the high-pressure receiver during the off season. All the portable systems, main system screw compressors, condensers and make up water chiller systems are located outdoors. Mechanical room houses main system high-pressure receiver, low-pressure recirculator package and one reciprocated compressor.\r\n\r\nAll three vacuum cooling systems is operated seasonally from April to November, and will be pumped down to onsite nurse tanks at the end of the season. These systems will be moved to Yuma, AZ facility for winter operations, from November to April.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of ammonia currently at the site is approximately 43,460 lb.

International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix 12.1, describe equipment details.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for each system is described in Chapter 8.3.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTaylor Farms California maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Chapter 16-Incident Investigation.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.

Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All of the relief valves at the facility and the vacuum cooling systems are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAccording to Taylor Farms California personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn the event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Chapter 20.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Chapter 0.0. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, priority level and implementation deadlines are also recommended.\r\n\r\nAll refr"
