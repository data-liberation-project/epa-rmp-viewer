This system requires that changes to items such as pumping equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to assure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n       Incident Investigation (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc 42433-0072)\n\nCHS Inc. promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, significant property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and assigns responsibility for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and assure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nCHS Inc. primarily uses the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP is a structured team-based hazard analysis that combines a prescribed list of \u0093deviations\u0094 from normal operations with a qualitative evaluation of associated risk. In addition, CHS Inc. uses the What If analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The What If technique is an unstructured team-based hazard analysis technique that combines open-ended brainstorming of events of concern with a qualitative evaluation of associated risks. These analysis are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the underground storage as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Process Hazard Coordinator for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.
