FPC-TX is a vertically integrated organization. The facility is located in the city of Point Comfort, Calhoun County, Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Processes' are\r\nCFB \r\nEthylene Glycol\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared by the Corporate Process Safety Management Specialist. Each operating unit has appointed one individual as the person responsible for implementation of the RMP in that Unit. The Environmental, Health and Safety, and the Process Safety Management Departments, through the Emergency Response Coordinator, oversee, provide guidance, and audit the RMP activities of the operating units.\r\n\r\nCompliance with 29 CFR 1910.119: On May 26, 1992, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule went into effect. FPC-TX is covered under this rule. The PSM rule consists of fourteen (14) elements. The facility has developed and implemented the fourteen elements of this rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVERED PROCESS - BRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEthylene Glycol 2 (EG -2)\r\n\r\nIn the Ethylene Glycol (EG-2) process, ethylene is oxidized by oxygen in the presence of a silver catalyst to make ethylene oxide. The oxygen may be provided by air or pure oxygen. In this plant pure oxygen is used which is coming from Air Separation Plant (ASP-2). \r\n\r\nThe process involves the direct (non-catalytic) reaction of ethylene oxide and water to form ethylene glycol. Other reactions take place since ethylene oxide also reacts with ethylene glycol and higher homologues. This brings about the formation of diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, etc. with no theoretical upper limit to the size of the molecular chain that can be made. However, because the reactions are consecutive, the lower homologues form in greater amounts and extremely high homologues rarely are formed. \r\nAll of the above reactions occur simultaneously and the relati"

      "SummaryText": "ve amount of each glycol produced depends primarily upon the initial ratio of water to ethylene oxide in the reactor and, to a lesser extent, upon the amount of glycols present in the feeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCFB \r\nThe CFB (circulating fluidized bed) technology has been converted to utilized natural gas as it's only combustion fuel. The overall output capacity is 300 Mega-Watts (MW) which is composed of two 150 MW generators. The plant consists of six major systems - 1) Water Treatment System, 2) Boiler and Turbine System, 3) Cooling Water System, 4) Electrical System, 5) SNCR and Waste Water System, 6) DCS System. Chlorine is utilized for biocide in the cooling water tower.\r\n\r\nHAZARDS OF THE PROCESS\r\n\r\nThe hazards associated with the chemicals used in all the referenced COVERED PROCESSES requires the unit to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29 CFR 1910.119), NFPA 58 (Storage- and handling of liquefied petroleum gases), Spill Prevention Control & Countermeasure program, and other applicable Resource Conservation & Recovery Act rule (RCRA) The equipment installed in the units was designed based on either ASTM, ANSI, or ASME standards. Before starting the each unit, a process hazard analysis (PHA) as required by OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 was completed. The methodology used was the Hazards and Operability Study. Since the last PHA study, process parameters have been changed, and additional process controls, process detection systems and mitigation systems have been installed. \r\nDuring the study, the PHA Team evaluated major hazards like, toxic gas release; fire; explosion; runaway reaction; over pressurization and overfilling tanks, reactors, etc.; equipment failure; and loss of cooling, heating, electricity and instrument air.\r\n\r\nBased on the hazards, the Team insured that there were adequate process controls like: \r\n\u00bf\tvents; \r\n\u00bf\trelief valves and rupture disks to insure that holding vessels do not fail in case of overfilling or over pressurization; \r\n\u00bf\tc"

These satellite shops provide Mechanical, Electrical, and Instrument Maintenance Services to the Operating Units. The following descriptions apply to all three Maintenance Disciplines. Interactions with Operating Units are through established Equipment Route Checks, scheduled preventative maintenance, and analysis of abnormal equipment conditions. In addition to regularly scheduled maintenance activities, the Satellite shops meet weekly with Operations to discuss concerns, schedules, and abnormal analysis results. Various Maintenance services are also performed upon request from Operations through the work order system. This system allows requested work to be managed and completed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThe Maintenance Organization as a whole exists to support Operations and provide equipment reliability, efficiency, and therefore equipment safety."
