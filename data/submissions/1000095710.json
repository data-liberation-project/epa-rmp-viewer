This is considered to be the distance to the endpoint of a toxic vapor cloud from a release before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short term exposure will no longer occur.  The worst-case and alternate case models were produced using Marplot.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined using RMP*Comp.  For this facility, the worst-case scenario would encompass a radius of 1.8 miles and the alternate case (more likely) would include a radius of only 0.1 mile.  The facility is located in a rural area and the population within the 1.8 miles is estimated at 428 while there is no one living within the 0.1 mile radius.  We ran several alternate cases with large releases and none of the alternate scenarios exceeded the 0.1 mile radius.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of Louisiana's Chemical Accident Program, OSHA CFR29, 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan.  This program includes all the Elements of the PSM/RMP Regulations with emphasis on procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the ammonia refrigeration system operating without releases.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter-in-place as determined necessary for the particular event.  Local Fire Departments would be notified immediately.  The facility met on August 22, 2021 with the local fire departments to coordinate activities and tour the facility.  The facility will meet with the fire departments annually to review any changes, update the emergency contact information and perform annual notification exercises. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facility has not had any incidents meeting OSHA or EPA definitions of an accidental re"

Haring Catfish processes seafood.\r\n\r\nThe facility has expanded it's ammonia refrigeration system and in early September 2021 will increase the ammonia inventory to 12,115 pounds.  This will exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and place the facility in Louisiana's Chemical Accident Prevention Program, OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Risk Management Plans.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe facility has been upgrading their ammonia refrigeration system over the past three years and this last upgrade replaced a smaller horizontal low temperature re-circulator with a larger vertical low temperature re-circulator.  The upgrades over the past three years includes using stainless steel piping rather than the cheaper carbon steel piping.  Ammonia does not corrode carbon steel pipe or stainless steel pipe; however, carbon steel pipe can corrode from the outside when in the presence of water.  Over time, if there would be air leaks in the insulation moisture can cause corrosion or pitting of carbon steel piping.  For this reason, the facility has elected to install stainless steel piping for all future expansions.  In the unlikely event that a release occurs, emergency shutdown switches can be reached without entering an area where a release might occur.  All vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that would relieve in the unlikely event that a high pressure situation should occur.  \r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nComputer air models were developed based on a worst-case release scenario involving a catastrophic structural failure of the system high pressure receiver.  The high pressure receiver could potentially contain the largest amount of ammonia in a single vessel at this facility.  EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of regulated substance ("
