Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. The Saint Jo Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tailgate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. The Saint Jo Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents t"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): The Saint Jo Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: The Saint Jo Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining: In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all"

New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors: The Saint Jo Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods for increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR): The Saint Jo Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: The Saint Jo facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: The Saint Jo Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: The Saint Jo Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: The Saint Jo Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Saint Jo Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Saint Jo Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's finding are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained."
