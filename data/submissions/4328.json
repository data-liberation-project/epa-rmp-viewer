Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Western Farm Service's Somerton facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 5199 West County 16th Street, Somerton, Arizona, 85350 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and Nitrosol / aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 127,500 pounds.\n\nNitrosol / Aqua ammonia (upto 20% of ammonia by weight) is stored in one 15,000-gallon above ground tank at the site. The maximum quantity of Nitrosol / aqua ammonia handled is 142,500 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 20% active ingredient by weight, is 28,500 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nA.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount releasing 127,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.

The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release of 84,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from a broken 4-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.5 miles.\n\nB.  Nitrosol / Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternstive release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 142,500 pounds of Nitrosol / aqua ammonia solution.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.29 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release of 10,000 pounds of Nitrosol / aqua ammonia solution from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Nitrosol / Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or Nitrosol / aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafet"
