Anthony Vineyards' safety and environmental policies are administered by the Operations Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/CalARP/RMP Program.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Anthony Vineyards facility is located at 5512 Valpredo Ave, Bakersfield, California. The facility is approximately 2.4 miles east of Highway 99. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural respect to the surrounding area with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes a refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for cold storage of grapes. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 29,821 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the cold storage of grapes, and fruits. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 30 psig on the low-pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Anthony Vineyards ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The facility con"

The facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the California Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that vent to the diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\"\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n? On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n\n\n\n? Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the PHA meeting on June 2, 2017, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material to date. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Anthony Vineyards facility has an emergency response plan in effect. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the follo"

To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's response plan to respond to the situation. If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, conducted on June 2, 2017, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Anthony Vineyards facility. The Pre-Startup Safety Review Meeting was conducted on July 28, 2017, prior to the startup/fill of the system. A PHA, Seismic Assessment and Pre-Startup Safety Review Meeting were completed to address the Pre-Cooler Expansion completed in 2018.  The Anthony Vineyards safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n"
