      "SummaryText": "\nExecutive Summary\n\n \n\n1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Pevely Dairy in St. Louis, Missouri is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store ice cream, milk, yogurt, juice, and other consumer food products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 23,200 pounds (i.e., 4,300 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver tanks (two interconnected vessels) that operate at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 7,200 pounds of liquid ammonia (at their maximum safe fill volume of 90%).  However, during typical operation, the tanks hold only about 4,800 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, ice builder, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia is easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The ice cream  processing units operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly freeze product.  Ammonia suction from the storage freezers and processing units at or below 0 psig passes through the low side accumulator befor"

The booster discharge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors.\n\n\n\nThe high side compressor suction draws from the intercooler (booster discharge) and the high side suction accumulators at about 25 psig.  These accumulators receive suction from the mix tanks, glycol chillers, and milk and juice storage coolers.  The liquid subcooler feeds liquid to the low side units. Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the high side accumulator is removed and return to the system.\n\n\n\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas), at 150 to 175 psig, is vented to a series of condensing towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and for operation of the pumper drums, which transfer liquid out of the accumulators.\n\n\n\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receivers where it is fed to the low and high side equipment.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, intercooler, and storage receivers from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of"

Moreover, a release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n\n\n\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n\n\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n\n\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system;\n\n\n\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\n\n\n\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing valves in the liquid lines.\n\n\n\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios required by 40 CFR 68.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and m"

A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n\n\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that a"

The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of the facility.  The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\n\n\n\n5.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe prevention program that is described in Section 2.0 of this Executive \n\nSummary is a management system that is designed to proactively identify, \n\nevaluate, and reduce the potential for a ammonia release and/or a release's \n\nimpact or consequence, due to failures in process, procedures, and \n\nequipment.  As safety improvements are identified by the management \n\nsystem they are evaluated and, where appropriate, implemented.  For \n\nexample, the facility may implement the following changes to further improve the safety of the process:\n\n\n\n* Additional training,\n\n* Periodic repair and replacement of equipment, and\n\n* Continued implementation and improvement of the PSM program.\n\n\n\n"
