      "SummaryText": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nFairfield Cooling conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response, will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nFairfield Cooling uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Drawings in Appendix 8.1 show the facility location map and site plan.\n\nFixed System:\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is fed by two (2) portable trailers that are located by Control Panel area. There are two (2) Recirculator Packages (RP1, RP2), and Recirculator Vessels are fed by the HPR vessels on the trailers. The Recirculator Packages are connected to each other and feed the evaporators in the cold rooms. There are total of five (5) cold rooms at the facility.  Room 2 is processing room; Room 3 is raw product cooler. Room 2 and Room 3 are connected to each other via service doors. Room 1 is palletizing room, and Room 1 a"

Main system ammonia charge including cold rooms, recirculatory packages, two high side trailers, and hydroshower is pumped down to stand-alone high-pressure receiver located in a shaded area for off-season storage. Two refrigeration high side trailers are removed from the site at the end of each season. \n\nPortable Refrigeration Systems:\n\nRefrigeration Trailers: There are total of two (2) high side trailers that brought to the site seasonally and connected to the house system. Each trailer houses two (2) compressors (on R-48; two (2) recip, on R-67; one (1) screw, one (1) recip), one (1) evaporative condenser on R-67, two (2) evaporative condensers on R-48, one (1) high pressure receiver. Trailers provide hot gas supply to room evaporators for defrosting operations. Ammonia charge of the trailers is approximately 1,210 lbs (243 gal.) in total. \n\nThere is a portable Hydroshower under the shade area, connected to the room 2 piping.\n\nFacility plans to lease two half car vacuum tubes and refrigeration trailer(s) for the upcoming season. This vacuum cooling system will not be tied to main system and operate as stand-alone system. Total charge for two vacuum cooling systems is approximately 4,440 lbs.\n\nTwo 1,000 gal. (2 x 5000 lbs.) ammonia nurse tanks are dedicated for the storage of vacuum tube system ammonia charge. These nurse tanks stored in a shaded area at the end of each season.\n\nUpdated refrigeration drawings are located in Appendix 8.1-Refrigeration System Drawings. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix 12.1, describe equipment details.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for each system is described in Chapter 8.3.\n\nAnhydrous "

      "SummaryText": "ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFairfield Cooling maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Chapter 16-Incident Investigation.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators are trained for safe operation of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are relief valves protecting pressure vessels which relieve to atmosphere. Adding an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent release to atmosphere from relief valves is a recommendation.\n\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAccording to Fairfield Cooling personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Cooling Supervisor will also b"

A description of the emergency response plan is included in Chapter 20.\n\n\n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Chapter 0.0. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, priority level and implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n\n\n"
