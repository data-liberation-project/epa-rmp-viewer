This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nTessenderlo Kerley owns and operates the Phoenix Facility located in Phoenix, Arizona. The facility produces ammonium polysulfide.  Ammonium polysulfide is produced in a reactor system from ammonium sulfide, elemental sulfur and anhydrous ammonia.  The system produces two different ammonium polysulfide products.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored in a presurized 30,000 gallon vessel and a 10,000 gallon vessel.\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified no listed flammable substances and only one toxic regulated substance kept on site.  The chemical, largest quantity on site, and associated threshold quantity is presented in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1\nLargest Quantity of Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance             Largest Quantity On Site (lbs)                     Threshold Quantity (lbs)\nAmmonia (anhydrous)                   150,000                                                               10,000\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nThe listed substance which is stored above threshold quantities at the Phoenix Facility is anhydrous ammonia.

Therefore, the Phoenix Facility is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\n\n\n Flammable Substances\n\nThe Facility does not have any flammable substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case release scenarios for flammable substances is not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case release of a toxic substance is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association. The ARP Program requirement for toxics, in a worst-case scenario, assumes the total quantity is released in ten minutes. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release of the above threshold quantity toxic substance using the EPA equations is presented in Table 2.  A release of 150,000 of ammonia (anhydrous) is the worst-case toxic release with a 4.2 miles distance to the endpoint.\n\nTABLE 2\nDistance to Endpoint for Worst-Case Scenario\n\n\nChemical Name                                            Ammonia (anhydrous)\nWeight (lbs)                                                              150,000\nToxic Endpoint ERPG-2 (mg/L)                                     0.14\nDistance to ERPG-2 (miles)                                          4.2\n\n\nAlternative Releases Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe Phoenix Facility does not have any flammable substances held above the threshold quantity.

The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The facility is in the process of reviewing the accident prevention program and is in various stages of implementing changes to improve work place safety.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communica"

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Phoenix Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include a process/project engineer assigned to the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria: 1) age of process; 2) extent of process hazards; 3) number of affected employees; and 4) operating history of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten procedures are to be maintained that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations; (3) temporary operations; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) emergency operations; (6) normal shutdown; (7) startup following a turnaround; and (8) start up after emergency shutdown.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  \n\nOperating procedures are to be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review is to assure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.

All of this training is to be documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Phoenix Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, there are procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules; and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview; (2) information about safety and health hazards including known or potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; (3) emergency response plan requirements; and (4) safe work pr"

Contract employee injury and illness log should be maintained.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR should be conducted on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and adequate.  A PHA is determined to have been conducted, recommendations resolved, and training of employees involved in the process is verified as part of the PSSR.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWell established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment should be kept. The basic aspects of this program are to include (1) training; (2) developing written procedures; (3) performing inspections and tests consistent with good engineering practices; (4) correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits; and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive train"

Quality assurance measures are to be incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nDuring construction of new processes or equipment, checks and inspections are to be performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions are suitable for the particular application.  The Facility has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  \n\nExamples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThere is a comprehensive system of written procedures to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, impact to safety and health and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel, including contractors employees, are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Facility promptly investigates (within 48 hours) all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports are maintained for five years.\n\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved; a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor); and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of incident and of investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident, and a recommendation to prevent a recurrence.  These results are forwarded to the business management team for resolutions.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Phoenix Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel partic"

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audits reports are retained.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Phoenix Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Phoenix Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Facility has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\nNot Applicable.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Pressure relief valves on railcars are designed to relieve at 265 psi.\n2. Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\n3.

Ventilate contaminated areas.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Phoenix Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There have been no incidents involving a release of anhydrous ammonia, which had no off-site effects.\n\nEmergency Procedure Information\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as for the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Facility.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Facility is coordinated with the Phoenix Fire Department.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident.  In addition, the Facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Facility provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant."
