Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is committed to continuously making safety improvements. To improve the safety of the anhydrous ammonia system, Wilbur-Ellis is in the process of developing a more comprehensive anhydrous ammonia inspection checklist for the bullet tank system and nurse tanks. The comprehensive checklist will include daily, weekly, and annual inspection frequencies, including visual and non destructive tests to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the tanks, valves, piping, etc. At a minimum, inspection frequencies will follow industry standards. Wilbur-Ellis is also implementing a facility-wide comprehensive corrective action/preventative action CAPA) log to track and facilitate completion of listed CAs on a timely basis. Recommended improvements and identified deficiencies from the  inspection checklists, compliance audits, and PHA studies will be included on the facility CAPA log along with the priority, employee responsible, and targeted completion dates.\r\n\r\n9.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68 Clean Air Act. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland staff is highly trained and utilize equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland is located at 1785 East Beamer St., Woodland, California in the county of Yolo. The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 11,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site. A maximum of 12- 1,000 gallon nurse tanks may contain anhydrous ammonia , may be staged at the facility.  The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia to 82% of the bullet tank and nurse tank capacities. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled and stored in this process is 107,502 pounds.\r\n\r\nAqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 25"

      "SummaryText": ",000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 24% active ingredient by weight, is 88,670 pounds. \r\n\r\n3. Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary. Please refer to the Hazard Assessment report for the results of this analysis. \r\n\r\n-Risk Considerations\r\n\r\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalation hazard; and thus, the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community. The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\r\n   -The history of the Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland (i.e., no CalARP-applicable anhydrous or aqueous ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \r\n\r\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\r\nThe facility's maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 107,502 lb.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lb threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM.  The 500 lb state threshold for the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program is also exceeded.  As a result, the anhydrou"

See EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM below.\r\n\r\nThe facility's maximum storage of aqueous ammonia is 88,670 lb in the aqueous solution.  Therefore, it is over the 20,000 lbs threshold (20% or greater concentration) for EPA RMP and the 500 lbs (all concentrations) state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM or Program 3 requirement due to the fact that the concentration of aqueous ammonia managed at the Facility is 24% and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantity of aqueous ammonia is only for concentrations greater than 44%. For the reasons mentioned above, the Aqueous Ammonia Storage Tank is subject to CalARP Program Level 2 and EPA RMP Program Level 2.\r\n\r\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Prevention Program 2 elements include:\r\n\r\n   -Safety Information\r\n   -Hazard Review\r\n   -Operating Procedures\r\n   -Training\r\n   -Maintenance\r\n   -Compliance Audits\r\n   -Incident Investigation\r\n\r\n5. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no EPA-applicable releases of ammonia at Wilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland in the past five years.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Woodland is not a First Responder.  Employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.
