Also included in the RMP are programs for the prevention of accidental releases and worker safety which reflect the key elements of OSHA's PSM requirements deemed essential for safe management of hazardous substances.\n\nCalabrian's Hazard Assessment Program has identified theoretical Worst-Case Scenarios (WCS) for the release of the largest quantities of regulated substances that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  WCS for Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine, both of which are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a liquid under pressure, assume the quantity of a 90-ton railcar is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The distance to endpoint in these WCS is 16 and 14 miles including an estimated population of 3,984 and 3,486 respectively.\n\nHazard Assessments of Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS), which are more likely to occur than the theoretical WCS for each substance, indentified pipeline leaks with a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles for Sulfur Dioxide and 0.3 miles for Chlorine.  Populations within this distance to endpoint are less than 100 individuals in both cases.\n\nAdministrative controls as well as passive and active mitigation measures were considered in each Hazard Assessment.  These include dikes, berms, drains, scrubbers and neutralization, and emergency shutdown systems.  Additionally, Calabrian's accidental release prevention program for both Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine include a"

All other OSHA Process Safety Management and RMP programs have been implemented.  Process controls for these regulated processes include, and are not limited to vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, and rupture disks.\n\nAll accidental releases from regulated processes were reviewed from the five years including 1994 through 1998 which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  Three incidents occurred during this period.  Two of the three gas release resulted in the administration of first aid treatment for on site workers.  No other injuries, deaths, property or environmental damage, nor public exposure resulted in either incident.  One additional gas release resulted in no deaths or property damage.  However, offsite impacts included a total of 15 individuals reporting to local hospitals for emergency first aid treatment and observation.  Additionally, minor damage to near-site lawn and shrubs was observed.\n\nCalabrian's written Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the community emergency response network and includes action to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.  These plans include procedures for informing local agencies responding to accidental releases, the public, and local medical community as well as information on emergency health care.  Training for site workers is conducted annually with information provided to municipal responders and local emergency planning committees."
