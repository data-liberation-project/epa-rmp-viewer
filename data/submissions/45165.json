      "SummaryText": "Omaha Steaks purchased this facility in May of 1998. Initially, and took full possession of it in January of 2000. in 2003 an additional 35,000 Sq feet was added to the facility including 10,000 Sq feet of freezer. The addition became fully operational in early December of 2003. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on September 9, 2003 before the addition went into operation. In addition, a PHA was conducted in March 2002, and prior to that a PHA study was conducted on May 20, 2000.     In April of 2004, a Compliance Audit was performed at the facility, as required by the PSM standard. The auditor congratulated Omaha Steaks, for the level of documentations, regarding the Program, and for dedicating a full time manager to oversee it.  Omaha Steaks has a very thorough safety and ergonomic program. The goal of the F Street Plant is to become a VPP Facility, no later than January 1, 2008. In June of 2004 a state of the art Ammonia Monitoring & Detection System was installed. The Management is confident, that employees and contractors training, will enable the facility to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, and also will help minimize the on-site, and the off-site consequnces of accidental releases. Our safety programs continue to be applied to any and all activites involving the process, storage, handling, or on-site movement of ammonia."
