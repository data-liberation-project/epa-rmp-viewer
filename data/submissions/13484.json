      "SummaryText": "\nWe are a grain treating facility.  The only material considered hazardous at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Our facility has one skid-mounted 12,000 gallon ammonia storage tank and equipment for treating grain with ammonia.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on the storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures. We have also coordinated with the Odem Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the effect from this scenario would extend 4.2 miles from our facility, and would include some residences, but no hospitals, schools, or major commercial areas.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPAs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a transport pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the effect from such a release would only extend 2600 feet and would include several residences.\n\nOur registration information indicates no full-time employees at this site.  This is because this facility is an unmanned facility, and employees are only at the site for the brief time that grain is being treated."
