The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and \r\nalternative release scenarios (ARSs). KMTEX does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents \r\na release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like KMTEX. These scenarios are available to KMTEX employees and\r\nthe public. If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator at (409) 985-4200.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public\r\nbecause of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.\r\nAt distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects should be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint\r\ndistance, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\n* When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would not experience any long-term \r\nhealth consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g. strong eye, skin or throat irritation, shortness of breath,\r\nand dizziness) are likely. Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenarios:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is a failure of the 433,000-gallon vinyl acetate storage tank in the \r\ntank farm resulting in a release of vinyl acetate over a 10-minute period. Administrative controls limit the quantity of \r\nvinyl acetate in the tank to 420,000 gal. This facility is not located in a populated area; however, the toxic cloud"

This scenario assumes that \r\nthe acetate vapor is released through the valve for 10 minutes before workers detect the release and isolate the system. This \r\nfacility is not located in a populated area; therefore, the toxic cloud formed by the release will not reach offsite public \r\nand/or environmental receptors.\r\n\r\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the KMTEX plant. The EPA regulates \r\nprocesses at the KMTEX plant; therefore, RMP regulations are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health \r\nAdministration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and \r\ndescribes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nKMTEX encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of \r\nemployee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a \r\nmember of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the KMTEX plant \r\naccident prevention program. \r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nKMTEX keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents \r\naddress chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and \r\nequipment design basis/configuration information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is \r\nprovided in material safety data sheets"

This \r\ninformation includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.\r\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection\r\nand maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features \r\nin the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nKMTEX has established programs to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and \r\ncontrolled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate \r\ncontrols are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nHAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are \r\nconducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings and/or action items are forwarded to appropriate personnel. All approved mitigation options being \r\nimplemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is \r\ndocumented and retained.\r\n\r\nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no \r\nlonger operating. The results and findings from these updates are also documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nKMTEX maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal \r\noperations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a \r\nreference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are reviewed and"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the \r\nfacts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team \r\ndocuments its findings and develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence.  Recommendations are tracked until they are \r\ncomplete. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nCompliance audits are conducted at least every two years. Both hourly and management personnel may participate as audit team\r\nmembers and typically a third-party consultant is hired to assist in the audit. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to KMTEX plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at KMTEX have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

KMTEX workers will respond to minor events \r\nthat do not have the potential for significant effect (e.g., small fires or small leaks). In the event of a larger fire or \r\nrelease, workers evacuate the area and contact the local fire department.\r\n\r\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nKMTEX strives to improve the safety of KMTEX processes through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, \r\nand a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers. KMTEX resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result \r\nin modifications to the process."

      "SummaryText": "KMTEX, \r\nRisk Management Plan\r\n\r\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nKMTEX is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for KMTEX workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this\r\ncommitment, KMTEX has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of this\r\nsystem is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at KMTEX and that complies with the requirements of \r\nthe Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements; Risk\r\nManagement Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan)\r\ndescribing the risk management program at KMTEX. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP\r\nrule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at KMTEX. \r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nKMTEX is committed to the safety of KMTEX workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the\r\nprevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. KMTEX implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\r\nreleases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained Emergency Response personnel\r\nwill respond to control and contain such releases. KMTEX evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and \r\ncontacts the local fire department to control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the\r\nrelease. \r\n\r\n1.2 KMTEX and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKMTEX may at times handle sufficient quantities of substances to be covered by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nSubstances that may be covered under this rule include:\r\n\r\n* Vinyl Acetate\r\n\r\nThe process for which Vinyl Acetate may be involved includes:\r\n\r\n* An vinyl acetate distillation to remove impurities.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the potential use of regulated substances at KMTEX the foll"
