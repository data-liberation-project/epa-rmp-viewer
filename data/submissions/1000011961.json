PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.  Process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures address various operating phases, such as the following:  (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdowns, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  \n\nOperator Training\n\nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Operator training is required to be documented.\n\nContractors\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.   The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics.    \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or facility modification that requi"

The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for existing mitigation measures that have been identified.  Based on the review conducted when preparing this executive summary, the ARS is considered a more realistic scenario and takes into account actual operating conditions.\n\nThe following are summaries of the toxic and flammable WCS and ARS modeling at Motiva.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (USEPA) RMP*Comp Version 1.07 off-site consequence analysis program.  Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS LandViewA? VI Environmental Mapping Software (2003).  \n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for the consideration of mitigation measures in WCS modeling, various prevention measures that are in place should reduce the likelihood of the WCS and its impacts should it occur.  These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs;\n- Routine surveillance by trained operators;\n- Various audible and visual alarm and notification systems;\n- Responder call-out, incident command establishment and staging, and agency notification, as necessary.\n\n1. Toxic Worst- Case Release Scenario - Hydrochloric Acid\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic failure of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) storage tank (L-432) resulting in a release of 201,750 lbs, based on the procedural limit of 75% in tank. The release calculation assumes urban topography with many obstacles in the immediate area. The 75"

The endpoint distance was calculated at 4.1 miles (21,648ft). A population estimate of 18,673 people off-site, including residential, religious, recreational, school and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  Bayou Trepagnier, a designated scenic stream adjacent to the northern side of the facility, may also be impacted.\n\n\n2. Toxic Alternative Release Scenario #1 - Hydrochloric Acid (conc 37% or greater)\n\nThe hydrochloric acid (HCl) storage tank (L-432) has a release as a result of a 3\" transfer hose line break during vessel charging.  A calculated amount of 28,900 lbs of HCl will be released in approximately 10 minutes before mitigation of the leak can occur.  This scenario was selected due to (1) a history of similar releases that occurred over the last 8 years on this tank during transfer operations and (2) the location of the vessel with respect to off-site receptors.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  A 750 cubic foot dike area encompasses the storage tank and was including in the model as a passive mitigation technique.  The endpoint distance was calculated at 0.2 miles (1,056 ft).  A population estimate of 182 people off-site, primarily located in residential areas, could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.  \n\n\n3. Toxic Alternative Release Scenario #2 - Hydrogen Sulfide\n\nThe block valve on the overhead vapor line in the HPLT separator (PV-1983) is inadvertently closed off creating an overpressure in the separator.  Approximately 95 lbs per minute of hydrogen sulfide would be released for 10 minutes before emergency responders could contain the situation.  This scenario was supplied by the DHT process engineer at Motiva.  The release assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested "

A population estimate of 22 people off-site, primarily located in residential areas, could be potentially be affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.\n\n\n4. Flammable Worst-Case Release Scenario - 1,3 Butadiene\n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario involves the instantaneous failure of a storage vessel (S-411) and the release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion of 30,297,949 lbs of 1,3 Butadiene.  The release calculation assumes rural topography due to the lack of congestion in the surrounding area.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 2.5 miles (13,200 ft).  A population estimate of 3,720 people off-site, including residential, recreational, religious, school and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  Bayou Trepagnier, a designated scenic stream adjacent to the northern side of the facility, may also be impacted. \n\n5. Flammable Alternative Release Scenario - Propylene\n\nThe alternative flammable scenario involves the release of propylene and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion resulting from a failure of an 8\" feedline flange.  The failure results in a 2\" leak opening in the flange.  The flange is located at grade.  A calculated amount of 229,000 lbs of propylene will be released in 25 minutes before mitigation of the leak can occur.  The release calculation assumes rural topography due to the lack of congestion in the surrounding area.  This scenario was selected due to the volume of propylene stored, storage pressure and the location of the vessel with respect to off-site receptors.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 0.3 miles (1,584 ft).  A population estimate of 22 people off-site, primarily located in residential areas, could be potentially be affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified."
