Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe team at National Frozen Foods Corporation Albany are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of ammonia from our closed loop refrigeration system. If such a release does occur, our emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with the Albany Fire Department who would provided additional emergency response expertise for our facility.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, which is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 76,809 pounds.\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  One process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility co"

The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at  a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, National Frozen Foods Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and start up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Operators are also required to complete and pass the RETA (Refrigeration Engineers Technicians Association) CIRO certification in order to operate our system.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practice"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at National Frozen Foods Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe start up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nNational Frozen Foods Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
