      "SummaryText": "In 1970, Siegfried (USA), Inc. (formerly named Ganes Chemicals, Inc.) bought a 146-acre site in Pennsville, NJ and in 1973 began producing active ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry.  These ingredients are used in a variety of prescription and over-the-counter drugs used for blood pressure control, weight reduction, decongestant, anti-depressant, anti-nausea and HIV treatment.  Over the years, the facility has expanded steadily and now includes three manufacturing buildings, two warehouses, offices, labs, a maintenance shop, a waste treatment facility, a dryer building, and a milling and blending facility.\n\n\n\nSiegfried USA has always been committed to operating its facility in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  Over the years, we have continuously improved our safety and environmental programs and in the mid 1980s these programs were further enhanced by our compliance with the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) and later with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard.  One of the additions to the program was the establishment of an Emergency Response Team made up of trained Ganes employees.  When the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came out with the requirement to establish a Risk Management Program (RMP) by June 1999, we only had to make some minor adjustments in our in our existing programs.  One of the adjustments was with regard to communications between Siegfried USA and the local and county emergency response groups.  We updated our respective emergency response plans and discussed how to improve notification to the community should an emergency occur.\n\n\n\nDuring 1997 and 1999, Siegfried USA opened its doors to the neighbors. The residents were allowed to familiarized themselves with the facility. In 2008, Siegfried received the ChemStewards Tier II certification for it's SHE&S program. This is a SOCMA program and requires periodic re-certification by an outside audit"

Siegfried was re-introduced into EPA RMP in June of 2013, due to exceeding the TQ for diethyl ether.\n\n\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenario:\n\nFlammable worst case scenario 1 assumes that T-1011, the 1,000-gallon reactor that is filled with 5713 lbs of diethyl ether during the Step 7 process, releases the entire amount of diethyl ether due to a faulty valve. The spill creates a puddle with an area of 364 m2 and a thickness of 1 cm. Although the spill occurs within a building, this scenario assumes a worst-case offsite consequence and is calculated as if it occurred if an open area. Using ALOHA, diethyl ether is modeled to determine the maximum evaporative rate. Using the aforementioned model, the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi and 2.3 psi were determined. There were no offsite area impacts from either radiant heat due to flammability or from an overpressure explosion.\n\n\n\nFlammable Alternate Case Scenario:\n\nThe flammable alternative release scenario 1 assumes that the waste ethers storage tank, BT-8108, releases the entire amount of diethyl ether due to a faulty valve. The spill creates a puddle with an area of 84 m2 and a thickness of 1.1 ft. Using ALOHA, diethyl ether is modeled to determine the maximum evaporative rate. Using the aforementioned model, the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi and 2.3 psi were determined. There were no offsite area impacts from either radiant heat due to flammability or from an overpressure explosion.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention:\n\nThe facility is inspected annually by New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection annually to verify compliance with the following New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe (TCPA) requirements:\n\n\n\n- Process Safety Information: includes the process design and safe operational limits information.\n\n- Process Haz"

Siegfried's EPM RMP goes dormant.\n\nJune 2013 - Siegfried's EPA RMP program is reinstated for the handling and use of Diethyl Ether. The storage and handling area is registered at 100,000 lbs of diethyl ether.\n\nJanuary 2014 - The registered quantity of Diethyl Ether in Process #47651 is increased due to the upscale of a process step. The waste storage and handling process is added, which includes bringing BT-8108 storage tank online. These changes resulted in a modification to both the worst-case and alternate-case scenarios for flammables for the site."
