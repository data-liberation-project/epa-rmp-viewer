      "SummaryText": "The purpose of this RMP submittal is to reflect changes in the facility's regulated substance present above threshold quantity in a previously uncovered process and change the facility emergency contact.\n\n\n\nE & J Gallo Fresno Winery (Gallo) is located at 5610 East Olive Avenue in Fresno, California.  The facility crushes grapes to produce juice for concentrate, wine, and distilled spirits.  The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia based closed loop heat transfer refrigeration system and non-refrigeration systems for pH neutralization and air emissions reduction. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration process begins in a high-pressure receiver where ammonia transfers through an expansion device into an evaporator.  Heat transfers into the low-pressure liquid ammonia which causes boiling and evaporating.  Low pressure, low temperature, high volume ammonia vapor moves into a compressor to compress the volume, which increases both temperature and pressure of the ammonia vapor.  Next, in the condenser, heat transfers out of the high-pressure vapor which causes cooling and condensing.  The now liquid ammonia is transferred back to the high-pressure receiver. (Taken from Figure 2-5, Industrial Refrigeration Course 1, Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association).\n\n\n\nNon-Refrigeration ammonia is used for pH neutralization of process water before being discharged to the Fresno POTW.  Additionally, four process boilers are located on site, equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices, using ammonia, for NOx air emissions reductions. Note, the SCR systems are not covered by Federal RMP regulations, but are included here as part of the facility description only.\n\n\n\nConsistent with this RMP submission, Gallo complies with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, program level 3. The facility also follows Federal and California Process Safety Management regulations (CFR 1910.119 and T"

The time for appropriate training and education of all employees is managed through annual training programs, job-specific continuing education for operators and technicians, and emergency management training for incident response.\n\n\n\nGallo has a detailed emergency response plan that describes how the site manages various types of emergencies including hazardous materials threatened or actual release, medical response, fire, external events, and others.  24-hour security staff are on-site to assist as needed.  Staff are trained to respond to the incidents within their level of training and will partner with emergency response personnel as required. When necessary, leaders can initiate a site-evacuation.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The ERT has an equipped trailer, ready for use by trained staff. Members of the facility leadership and management teams have received training in the Incident Command System.  \n\n\n\nGallo routinely updates its Hazardous Materials Business Plan (Tier II compliance) to update the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fire Department. The facility has conducted coordinated training events with local fire in the past and will continue that practice based on emergency responder availability.\n\n\n\nGallo employs RETA-trained operators, technicians, and supervisory staff.  Ammonia systems are maintained through industry standard based programs for inspection, testing and preventative maintenance. \n\n\n\nIn the event of a chemical release, notifications are made to the appropriate agencies including the Fresno County Environmental Health Department, the California State Office of Emergency Services, and when required, the National Response Center. \n\n\n\nIn the five years prior to this sub"

New full-time professional EHS staff have been hired to provide expert advice and oversight.  A training development company was contracted to develop a world-class training program. A new training department was created to manage the development and implementation of these training programs.  Additionally, the facility now has a separate dedicated refrigeration team leader.\n\n\n\nThe facility now uses an electronic management system, Intelex, to track action items resulting from its audits, assessments and other reviews of its covered processes and equipment. Intelex provides multi-level assurance that action items are completed by sending automated prompts approaching their due dates and provides ready access to all relevant staff, including site operational leadership, to foster increased accountability.   \n\n\n\n"
