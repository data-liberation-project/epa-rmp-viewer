This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nSysco - Riverside senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Sysco - Riverside's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Director of Fleet and Facilities and the Safety Director, who conduct inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Sysco - Riverside facility is located at 15750 Meridian Parkway in Riverside, California, which is approximately 4 miles south of CA-Highway 60 and 1/2 miles west of Interstate 215.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas.  The facility was constructed and began operations in 2013.   \n\n\n\nThe primary business of Sysco - Riverside is to provide cooling and storage of food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 18,180 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration.  Typical operating conditions range from 1.6\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 185 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nThe system at was constructed in accordance with al"

The receiver feeds high pressure liquid to the +15F Recirculator (V2). It also provides high pressure liquid ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.\n\n\n\nThe +15F Recirculator feeds pumped liquid to the dock and cooler air units (AU-8 - AU-23) and provides subcooled liquid to the -15F Recirculator (V3). The +15F Recirculator also acts as an Intercooler. It receives booster discharge from Compressor C6. The liquid within the vessel is subcooled as the suction and booster discharge absorb its heat. High stage suction is then sent to the compressors. \n\n\n\nThe -15F Recirculator receives subcooled liquid from the +15F Recirculator and can also receive high pressure liquid directly from the receiver. The -15F Recirculator pumps low temp recirculated liquid to the freezer air units (AU1 - AU7).  \n\n\n\nAt the evaporators, the liquid ammonia, flowing through coils in the unit, is partially boiled as it absorbs heat from the product and room.  The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) is returned to the recirculators (AU1 - AU6 return to the -15F Recirculator, AU7 is sent to the -30F Accumulator (V4), and AU8 - AU23 returns to the +15F Recirculator), wherein the liquid drops to the bottom of"

All evaporators receive hot gas from the compressors for defrost.\n\n\n\nThe -30F Accumulator receives wet suction form the Ice Cream Air Unit (AU7). The liquid settles to the bottom of the vessel and is pumped to the -15F Recirculator to be used in the system. The vapor is drawn from the top of the vessel by Compressor C6 which is dedicated to the -30F low stage suction.\n\n\n\nThe seven compressors pull suction from the recirculators and accumulator. Compressors C1 - C2 pull high stage suction from the +15F Recirculator. Compressor C3 is a swing compressor and can pull high stage suction from the +15F Recirculator or low stage suction from the +15F Recirculator depending on system demand. Compressors C4 and C5 pull low stage suction from the -15F Recirculator with side port suction from the +15F Recirculator. Compressor C6 pulls suction from the -30F Accumulator. At these Compressors, the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased through the discharge port of the machines.  Compressors C1 - C5 then send high pressure discharge vapor to the Condensers.  Compressor C6 sends booster discharge to the +15F Recirculator. Compressor C7 receives high stage suction from the +15F Recirculator and sends hot gas to Cooler Air Units (AU9, AU14, AU15, AU18, and AU19).\n\n\n\nThe Underfloor Heat Exchanger (HX-1) is a shell and tube heat exchanger which is designed to be used in a separate, closed loop system for under floor heating.  The Underfloor Heat Exchanger receives hot gas discharge from Compressors C1 - C5.  As the high temperature ammonia vapor passes through the heat exchanger unit, it is partially condensed as the glycol absorbs heat from the ammonia.  The resulting (liquid/vapor mixture) flows to the high temp recirculated suction line to the +15F Recirculator.\n\n\n\nAt the Evaporative Condenser EC-1, air (fans) and water (pumps) are used to condense t"

All relief valves in the engine room are piped to a common header, which vents to the ammonia diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Sysco - Riverside ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The maintenance activities and schedules were developed by, and are performed by, an outside ammonia refrigeration maintenance contractor. \n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the 2009 Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in the cold rooms and vent line.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to an ammonia diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Sysco - Riverside has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.
