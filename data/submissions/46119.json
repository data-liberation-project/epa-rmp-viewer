      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Lufkin Water Plant is located in Lufkin, Texas at 3702 Martin Luther King Drive.  The facility is owned and operated by the City of Lufkin (City).  This facility disinfects ground water collected from a well field and pumped into the plant.  The water is chlorinated as it enters the plant and after it has passed through vertical aeration towers and is being pumped into the ground storage tanks.  Currently, a maximum of 42,000 pounds of chlorine are maintained at the site in two separate facilities.  The original facility, identified as Plant 1, houses 30,000 pounds.  While a newer facility, identified as Plant 2, houses an additional 12,000 pounds.  No other toxic or flammable substances as listed in 40 CFR 68 are stored or utilized at the facility.\n\nSafety Policies\nThe City is fully committed to safety at the Water Plant.  The Lufkin Utilities Department has long emphasized the importance of safety in storing and using regulated toxic substances and has used the 40 CFR 68 requirements as an opportunity to further refine its program.  The City has also used this opportunity to strengthen its emergency response procedures between the Water Plant and the City Fire Department.  The Fire Department is capable of responding to accidental releases of chlorine, should a release occur.  The Fire Department has previously conducted a training exercise simulating a toxic release at the facility.  Finally, the City will continue to improve its risk management program, as it has with this update, for the Water Plant.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe City's commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine is demonstrated by its excellent track record with this substance.  The Water Plant has not experienced an accident related to chlorine within the past eight years.  The City is not aware of any such accidents prior to the past eight years either.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nFor the facility's offsite consequence analysis, a worst-case scenario wa"

Public receptors do exist within this radius, including residences, educational facilities, parks, and major commercial/industrial buildings.  As required by the regulations, alternative release scenarios for potential chlorine releases were also developed.  The resulting radii of impact for these releases were also evaluated and are useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\n\nPrevention Program Description\nThe City's level 2 prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances into the air will be minimized.  This component will be used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program will also become part of the ongoing training of the plant personnel.  The prevention program includes the following components:\n\n*  Safety Information:  Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment at Plants 1 and 2.  Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs.\n\n*  Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated process at both Plant 1 and Plant 2.  These procedures will be updated in the future should any additional major changes in the handling or storage of regulated substances occur.\n\n*  Training:  Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in the processes.  This training includes sessions conducted by the City Fire Department.  Periodic refresher training is also required.\n\n*  Maintenance:  Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the process equipment is maintained.  Ongoing training of personnel responsible for maintenance is also required.  Inspection and testi"

An initial audit was conducted in April 2002.  The most recent audit was conducted in April 2006.\n\n*  Incident Investigation:  Should an incident involving a release, or near release, of a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety of the process.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe City of Lufkin has determined that the Water Treatment Plant will assume a non-responder status with respect to accidental releases of chlorine.  The Fire Department for the City will instead be the appropriate local emergency response in such cases.  The Lufkin Fire Department has the necessary training to respond to chlorine leaks.  The Water Plant has coordinated with the Fire Department to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plant regarding response to a potential release.\n\nEven as a non-responder, the facility's employees have a significant role in the event of a chlorine release.  Should a release occur or be suspected when employees are at the facility, employees responsible for working with chlorine will follow procedures for assessing the situation and attempting to safely stop the release using normal shutdown procedures.  Facility personnel will receive ongoing training in identification of potential releases, and in how to determine when emergency response personnel should be involved.\n\nThe Water Utilities Department will continue to work closely with the Fire Department to ensure that emergency response, should it become necessary, is efficiently and safely carried out.  Coordination may include:\n\n*  Periodic meetings between operators and Fire Department emergency responders to discuss emergency response measures\n\n*  Periodic inspection of the facility b"

If the Water Plant is modified to meet the changing demands of the City, further improvements in the treatment processes to manage risks associated with this regulated substance will be considered."
