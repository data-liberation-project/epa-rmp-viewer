      "SummaryText": "Mennel Milling Company operates a mill in Mt. Olive, Illinois that processes wheat into several different grades of flour.  Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is added to the milled flour to achieve the desired pH.  The amount of chlorine added varies depending on the desired characteristics of the flour and the type and nature of the incoming wheat.\n\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. and used in one ton containers.  The supplier delivers full chlorine containers to the site via truck.  The containers are unloaded by the supplier directly onto specially designed wheeled carts.  Mennel Milling staff then positions the carts in the chlorine room and connects the ton containers to the feed system.  The chlorine room was designed to hold a maximum of four ton containers.  However, Mennel Milling currently intends to have a maximum of three containers on site at any one time.  Therefore, the maximum current inventory is 6,000 pounds.  In the future, it is conceivable that the fourth container could be installed which would bring the maximum inventory to 8,000 pounds.\n\nMennel Milling Co. uses a vacuum feed system for the application of chlorine that is inherently safe.  This system involves the use of low-pressure air flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the \nvacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.\n\nMennel Milling Co. has contracted with Research Products Co. (REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and corrective maintenance on the chlorine feed systems.\n\nMennel Milling Co. has developed a comprehensive, accidental release prevention program as part of the OSHA PSM program.  The elements of this program include:\n7 Process Safety Information\n7 Process Hazard Analysis\n7 Operating "

The worst-case release scenario involves the rupture and complete loss of chlorine from a full one-ton container outside the chlorine room at Mennel Milling.  The distance to the specified endpoint (3-PPM chlorine in air) is estimated to be 1.3 miles.  This distance was estimated using USEPA's tables provided in the guidance material.  The worst-case release scenario does not take into account any administrative controls or passive mitigation measures.\n\nAn alternative-case release scenario was also performed based on the experience of mill operators.  The alternative scenario considers a leaking gasket at the connection between a one-ton chlorine container and the valve/piping system while the system is operating.  It is assumed that the doors of the chlorine building are closed and the ventilation fan is running, exhausting fumes to the atmosphere.  It is also assumed that the leak is detected and a response curtails the release in 10 minutes. The distance to the specified endpoint (3-PPM chlorine in air) is estimated to be 0.1 miles.  This distance was estimated using \nUSEPA's tables provided in the guidance material.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at Mennel Milling Co. that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe Macoupin County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Mt. Olive Fire Department have been contacted by Mennel in an attempt to coordinate response efforts and to become included in the community emergency response plan.  An Emergency Action Plan for the site is under development.  This plan will contain measures that Me"

      "SummaryText": "nnel Milling staff can take to alert employees to a release, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significant release, and many other elements.  Mennel Milling will \nreceive training to allow for defensive action in response to an on-site release. \n\nMennel Milling Co. has performed a hazard evaluation for the chlorination processes at the facility.  As a result of this evaluation, several changes are planned to improve safety.  These changes, to be implemented by the end of 1999, include (but are not limited to) the following:\nEstablishment of a procedure to minimize the potential for accidents during unloading of full chlorine containers;\nInterlocking of flour agitator motors with the auto cabinet ball valve such that the valve will close and stop the flow of chlorine gas in the event of an agitator motor cut out;\nInstallation of sleeve or other protective cover for chlorine line between the new chlorine room and the mill;\nInstallation of a remote on/off switch for the chlorine cabinet automatic valve to allow the flow of chlorine to be stopped remotely."
