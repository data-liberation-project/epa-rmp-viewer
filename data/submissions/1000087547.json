Development lots from one to 550 acres are provided with utility and rail infrastructure for industrial users.  The facility is located in Cheyenne, WY, where HollyFrontier Corporation (H.F.C.) also operates a refinery.  H.F.C. stores liquid petroleum gas (L.P.G.) and diesel tank cars at the site Swan Ranch facility.\r\n\r\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (O.S.H.A.) standard, 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals requires that employers develop and implement a P.S.M. and R.M.P. Program whenever quantities of the chemicals listed in Appendix A of the standard exceed the recommended thresholds or when the total amount of flammable liquids on site exceed 10,000 lbs.  O.S.H.A. defines flammable liquids as having a flash point of 100\u00b0F or less.\r\n\r\nUS Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.E.P.A.) regulation 40 C.F.R. 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions sets forth the list of regulated substances and thresholds, the requirements for owners or operators of stationary sources concerning the prevention of accidental releases and the State accidental release prevention programs.  The list of substances, threshold quantities and accident prevention regulations promulgated under that part also do not limit in any way the U.S.E.P.A. general duty provisions under the Risk Management Planning requirements.\r\n\r\nThe flammable liquids (< 100\u00b0F) in the onsite processes, specifically the switching and storage of L.P.G. tank cars, exceeds the 10,000 lbs.

The methanol tank was modeled using pure methyl formate; because, methanol is not listed in the RMP*Comp database and \"Reference for Consequences Analysis\".  Methyl formate was conservatory selected; because, it has the lowest molecular weight compared to other flammable liquids found in Table C-2 and has a lower flammability liquid limit than methanol.  \r\n\r\nSwan Ranch is comprised of a number of separate business operations that this P.S.M. and R.M.P. Program Manual for L.P.G. and diesel railcar transport/storage is intended to cover.  Cheyenne Logistics Hub, L.L.C. (C.L.H.) is the owner of railroad track and land.  Swan Ranch Rail Road, a Division of Watco, is the short line operator.  Granite Peak Trans Loading, L.L.C. functions as the trans-loader of diesel.  To date, there have only been four rail cars of diesel trans-loaded and it is uncertain whether this operation will be continued.  Finally, Cheyenne Rail Hub, L.L.C. (C.R.H.) is responsible for track rental, rail car storage, and potential trans-loading.\r\n\r\nThe processes at the modern, approximately 7,200-acre facility are designed, operated and maintained in full compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAEP); and applicable building and industry codes.  NFPA 30 Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, 2018 was adhered to in the new construction design and building of the regulated processes.  NFPA 30 is part of the International Fire Code, which is widely recognized by state and local inspecting governments.\r\n\r\nProcess and risk safety management systems and procedures are in place to manage changes in process technology, facilities, operating procedures and maintenance procedures in order to provide for continued safe and reliable operations.\r\n\r\nAll employees at the Swan Ranch facility understand that they have the responsibility to protect the environment and to ensure the safety and security of their fellow workers.

It was developed by Granite Peak Development and is part of the Swan Ranch project.  Four thousand acres are located at the southwest intersection of Interstate 80 (I-80) and Interstate 25 (I-25) and the remaining 3,200 acres are located across I-25 to the east.\r\n\r\nC.L.H. operates a large private railroad switchyard that is served by the B.N.S.F. Railway (B.N.S.F.) and the Union Pacific Railroad (U.P.).   The switchyard is adjacent to the B.N.S.F. tracks on the southern end of the property and the U.P. tracks on the west side of the property.  It has a number of feeder tracks.  The High Plains Interchange (I-25 Exit 4) provides main access to the park and is located on the east side of C.L.H.   C.L.H.  may also be accessed from the College Avenue Interchange (I-25 Exit 7).  C.L.H. is platted and zoned for Heavy Industrial (H.I.), Light Industrial (L.I.) and Highway Commercial (H.C.).  \r\n\r\nThe average number of liquefied petroleum gas (L.P.G.) pressurized tank cars stored at the facility is 70, while the maximum is 120.  The average number of methanol liquid tank cars stored at the site is two, while the maximum is three.  The average and maximum diesel non-pressurized tank cars is four.  The L.P.G. DOT112J340W tank cars (33,700 gallons/ load limit 162,400 lbs.) are stored at the site by HollyFrontier Corporation.  The methanol DOT 111A100W1 non-pressurized liquid tank cars have a 30,000 gallon capacity and a 263,000 lbs. gross rail load.  The diesel tank cars are DOT111 or DOT117"

Both the methanol and diesel liquid tank cars have a sloped bottom and covered bottom outlet valve.\r\n\r\nL.P.G. has a flash point of -156\u00b0 F, which is <100\u00b0 F the P.S.M. and R.M.P. applicability thresholds.  Methanol has a flash point of 52\u00b0 F, which is also <100\u00b0 F and under the P.S.M. threshold; however, methanol's boiling point is >100\u00b0 F so there is no R.M.P. applicability.  The diesel tank cars are included in this program as a best management practice since diesel has a flash point of 126\u00b0 F, which exceeds all of the 100\u00b0 F P.S.M. and R.M.P. thresholds.\r\n\r\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing P.S.M. and R.M.P. inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process."
