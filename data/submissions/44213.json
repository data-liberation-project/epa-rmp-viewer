Fuming Sulfuric Acid is an RMP regulated substance.\n\nA double wall tank will be used for storage and handling of the material.  Additional controls include a scrubber system, internal plug on the tank and a sophisticated computer monitoring system.  \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nPilot Chemical Company complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), Texas and applicable EPA Regulations, and Department of Transportation Requirements.  The facility is ISO 9001- 2000 certified. \n\nTrained personnel and environment, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the Houston plant?s operation.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, monitors, emergency shutdown systems and computer controls for the processes.  Every individual in the facility receives appropriate training.  Training may consist of an overview of the plant and safety alarms, HAZCOM, a process and hazards overview for contractors before they begin working in a unit, or job-related training or testing for an operator or supervisor prior to assuming their duties. Training is an ongoing process that includes periodic retraining, as necessary.  Safety, environmental, operating, and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met.  Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency.  Training and updating procedures are monitored with multiple systems.  \n\n\nPilot Chemical Company?s Houston facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs that"

      "SummaryText": " minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Routine inspections of equipment are done in the same manner as the initial quality assurance inspections completed prior to installation.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as loop testing, where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized including, vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by insurance specialists, and root-cause analysis procedures.  Piping is inspected and tested with hydrostatic tests prior and after installation. The piping is monitored by methods such as visual inspections by the operators or maintenance personnel, emissions monitoring using sophisticated instruments, or thickness measurements. MP2 Maintenance Software is utilized to manage predictive, preventive and repair maintenance items.\n\n\nFive-year accident history.\n\nPilot Chemical Company?s Houston facility has not had a release of a regulated chemical that meets the EPA's reporting guidelines in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe plant has a written emergency response plan.  The plan includes procedures for informing emergency response organizations of an emergency condition; documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; and procedures and measures for emergency response.  \n\nPlanned changes to Improve Safety\n\nPilot Chemical Company is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production issues into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations. Changes in control instruments are made on an ongoing basis, as necessary, to assure that the most reliable and effective controls are used.  \n\n\nFor additional plant information, contact Russell Brown, Plant Manager, at phone number 281-448-3222.
