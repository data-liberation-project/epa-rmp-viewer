A primary aspect of this commitment is the IP Pine Bluff system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, IP Pine Bluff will implement procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  IP Pine Bluff Pine Bluff\u00bfs emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nTo effectively implement these policies, IP Pine Bluff established a management system headed by the Manager of Environmental, Health and Safety to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n2.0  IP Pine Bluff and Regulated Substances\n\nThe International Paper Pine Bluff Mill, located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, is primarily involved in the manufacture of high quality coated bleached paperboard.  To manufacture our products, IP Pine Bluff utilizes one regulated substance, chlorine dioxide, which is covered by the RMP Rule.  The chlorine dioxide used at IP Pine Bluff, is generated on site, immediately absorbed into water, and then stored in a 0.9% solution.  The RMP Rule exempts regulated t"

Chlorine dioxide was evaluated for possible worse case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  It is important to understand that IP Pine Bluff has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenarios represent a more realistic potential for occurrence and are based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, IP Pine Bluff has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \u00bfPrevention Program\u00bf section of this plan.\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be affected because of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program (Program 3)\n\nIP Pine Bluff's Chlorine Dioxide System and other processes at the facility are covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.

These documents are used to:\n\n? train employees,\n? perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n? help maintain the equipment.\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Chlorine Dioxide System are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nIP Pine Bluff performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Chlorine Dioxide System to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Chlorine Dioxide System is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, IP Pine Bluff primarily uses the HAZOP technique, supplemented with checklists.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorine Dioxide System operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.

The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the Prevention Program are implemented.  IP Pine Bluff maintains records of at least the last two audits conducted.\n\n4.9  Incident Investigation\n\nIP Pine Bluff promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n 4.10  Employee Participation\n\nIP Pine Bluff developed a written employee par"

      "SummaryText": "al Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, IP Pine Bluff has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at our facility.  These safety features for Chlorine Dioxide include:  \n\n? Mitigation systems include, use of concrete dikes, berms and drains.\n? The rate of chlorine dioxide which evaporates from the 0.9% solution is proportional to the temperature - The higher the temperature, the more chlorine dioxide released.  A chilled water system has been installed to keep the solution cool and to use for spraying on released material to minimize the evaporation rate.\n? All chlorine dioxide generators and storage tanks are equipped with explosion hatches, which rise to relieve the sudden pressure resulting from an explosion.\n? Process controls include vents, relief valves, shutoffs, and alarms.\n? Monitoring and detection systems include process area detectors and perimeter monitors.\n\n6.0  Five-Year Accident History\n\nIP Pine Bluff has completed a five-year accident history study of the Chlorine Dioxide System process.  No incidents have occurred in the Chlorine Dioxide System process, which resulted in offsite or onsite injuries or property damage.\n\n\n7.0  Emergency Response Programs\n\nIP Pine Bluff maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  \nThe IP Pine Bluff emergency response program includes procedures for:\n\n? informing the local LEPC, fire department, and public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences,\n? providing proper first aid and emergency treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances,\n? evacuation plans and methods for accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\n?"
