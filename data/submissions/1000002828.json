Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with ORLANDO FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilityA?s primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid, and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine is received into Chattanooga in 180,000 pound railcars.  The product is then repackaged in different size containers for distribution to customers.  The Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid and Aqua Ammonia are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Aqua Ammonia are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 2,235,000 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), and Aqua Ammonia are present at our facility in quantities of 55,000 lbs. and 173,835 respectively.\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDA"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"WHAT IF\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n \nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process"
