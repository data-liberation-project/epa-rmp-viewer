      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nHawkins, Inc. was founded in 1938 and is a progressive business that supplies chemicals, delivery systems and expertise to improve the environment.  We create alternative solutions for delivery and assist customers in creating new offerings across many markets.  Our traditional focus has been on the sale, delivery, and safe handling of bulk chemicals.  Today, Hawkins is becoming more specialized by working with customers with very exacting specifications seeking appropriate and innovative alternatives to meet their needs.\n\n\n\nHawkins is based in Roseville, Minnesota with branches throughout the United States.  Hawkins provides water and waste-water treatment equipment and chemicals to improve the quality of life and operate in concert with the environment.  Hawkins also supports customers in the fields of energy, electronics, chemical processing, pulp and paper, medical devices, and metal finishing.  Food manufacturers, processing plants, and pharmaceutical concerns across the nation benefit from Hawkins' chemical distribution, blending and related expertise.\n\n\n\nHawkins' mission is to exceed our customers' expectations as a high-quality, service-oriented chemical supplier.  We adapt quickly to the changing chemical needs of customers with a keen focus on technical expertise, teamwork, safety, profitability, and responsible care of the environment and of our community.\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary \n\nPrevention and Emergency Response policies:  Hawkins' management and safety committees have set a motto of \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\" regarding accidents and injuries.  Support for this motto is manifested in several ways, including:\n\n1.    A corporate Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) department staffed with trained professionals.\n\n2.    Training programs in chemical safety, safe material handling, accident prevention and emergency response.\n\n3.    Prompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences."

Internal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\n\n7.    Members in good standing with the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a chemical distribution and manufacturing facility that handles products used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  \n\n1.    Bleach Manufacturing Process:  Chlorine is brought onto the site in 90-ton railcars and stored in the railcars until they can be used as raw material in the Bleach Manufacturing Building.\n\n2.    Warehouse Process: Chemical storage at the WTG Warehouse - different from the Bleach Manufacturing Building.  Containers are brought onsite via box truck/trailer in pre-packaged containers and are stored onsite until delivery. These containers are not used on site, but are stored until they are shipped to a customer site.\n\n?    Chlorine - 150-pound cylinders up to 2,000-pound containers. \n\n?    Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - 150-pound containers. \n\nNo chlorine or sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) containers are packaged in the warehouse process.\n\n\n\nChlorine is the only chemical covered by Process Safety Management (PSM) at this facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through training, safe handling procedures and safety systems that properly protect chlorine and sulfur dioxide while on-site.  This starts with DOT approved containers that are robustly designed to contain chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) through expected conditions during transportation and storage.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely handle chemicals and their containers.  \n\n\n\nHawkins accident prevention program inc"

Hawkins uses the Chlorine Institute Pamphlets as reference guides in the use and handling of chlorine containers.\n\n7.    Members in good standings with National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n\n5-year Accident History:  There has not been an accident involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:  In the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), employees are trained on how to detect the source of the issue and take appropriate action such as closing or tightening a valve, or if the employee is not part of the on-site hazmat team, to evacuate the area and notify appropriate personnel.  If an accidental release should occur, this facility has a trained on-site hazmat team including proper equipment (SCBA, response kits, and recovery vessel) to respond.  This facility has also conducted meetings, training sessions, table-top exercises and full-scale exercises with the local emergency planning committee and hazardous materials responders (Clinton County Special Emergency Association) and the Camanche Local Volunteer Fire Department to ensure everyone is aware of the hazards at this site.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\"\n\n"
