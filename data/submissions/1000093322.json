If an accidental release should occur, this facility has a trained on-site hazmat team including proper equipment (SCBA, response kits, and recovery vessel) to respond.  This facility has also conducted meetings, training sessions, table-top exercises and full-scale exercises with the local emergency planning committee and hazardous materials responders (Clinton County Special Emergency Association) and the Camanche Local Volunteer Fire Department to ensure everyone is aware of the hazards at this site.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to Think Safe! Be Safe!"

Containers are brought onsite via box truck/trailer in pre-packaged containers and are stored onsite until delivery. These containers are not used on site, but are stored until they are shipped to a customer site.\r\n\u00bf\tChlorine - 150-pound cylinders up to 2,000-pound containers. \r\n\u00bf\tSulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - 150-pound containers. \r\nNo chlorine or sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) containers are packaged in the warehouse process.\r\n\r\nChlorine is the only chemical covered by Process Safety Management (PSM) at this facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through training, safe handling procedures and safety systems that properly protect chlorine and sulfur dioxide while on-site.  This starts with DOT approved containers that are robustly designed to contain chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) through expected conditions during transportation and storage.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely handle chemicals and their containers.  \r\n\r\nHawkins accident prevention program inc"
