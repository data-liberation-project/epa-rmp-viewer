We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.   \n\nThe Duncan Compressor Station is owned and operated by Enterprise Products Operating LLC.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved.\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\n* Emergency Response Programs.\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Duncan Compressor Station that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Duncan Compressor Station is a field gas compression and dehydration facility.  A gas cooling unit utilizes chilled, circulating water to help cool the facility inlet gas to remove condensed natural gas liquids (NGL) from the inlet gas.    The condensed NGL is sent to an NGL storage bullet and is removed from the facility via tanker truck.  The residue gas stream is compressed and shipped via pipeline to distribution by others.\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals/flammables that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\nFlammables\n\nA mixed natural Gas Liquid is the only flamm"

The details of the offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather are reflected in the data components of the RMP.  There are no receptors in the Worst Case Scenario distance, so the facility is eligible and is being registered as an RMP Program 1 facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise's Duncan Compressor Station maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The location is visited daily by operations personnel who receive extensive Environmental, Health and Safety training.  High pressure and high level alarms are in place with automatic shutdown controls to react to abnormal operating conditions.  The system volumes and pressures are monitored through a supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA).\n\nThe ERP is reviewed with Enterprise's employees at least annually or when any changes are made to the ERP.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAs a part of the prevention efforts, there are several programs in which Enterprise employees participate.  A training program has been developed in which Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the facility,"

All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazardous materials.  Enterprise is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community.\n\nAccident History\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, this facility has not had any accidental release in the past 5 years.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that have either been recently completed or are planned for implementation at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases: \n\n* Enterprise has just recently acquired ownership and operation of the Duncan Compressor Station.  The Company is currently working to provide communication of operating information into the Company's centralized control facility to provide 24-hour monitoring of key operating variables."
