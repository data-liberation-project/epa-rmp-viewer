      "SummaryText": "Jewel-Osco (?Jewel?) is a diversified retailer of grocery products. Jewel is the wholly owned Midwest Division operating unit of Albertsons, Inc. (Boise, ID). Jewel operates many retail grocery stores that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex that straddles property in two cities, Melrose Park and Franklin Park, Illinois. The Jewel distribution operation employs over 1200 people. The original refrigerated distribution center uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of certain food products in storage; however, in 2002/2003, another ammonia refrigeration system was constructed for cooling of frozen food items. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Both of the refrigeration systems exceed the threshold quantity of ammonia and are thus subject to the RMP regulation.\n\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), Jewel has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to ammonia.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for each of the ammonia refrigeration systems using the industry standard What-If? Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA of the original system was completed in early 1999, and the PHA for the new freezer system was completed in May 2003; both analyses were completed by technical and operations staff from the Jewel facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm.  \n\nJewel is committed to the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration systems at the Melrose Park distribution center. Implementation of the revised PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan "

      "SummaryText": "includes standard operating procedures for safe operation of the refrigeration systems, a preventive maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and programs for training operators and maintenance employees responsible for these functions.  The PSM program also includes programs for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the systems. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system.\n\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the distribution center?s emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.The Jewel distribution center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment. However, as part of the RMP requirements, Jewel undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases of the largest vessels in the system.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. \n\nThe worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the high pressure receiver associated with the new freezer refrigeration system; this vessel is located indoors. The analysis of this release indicates the potential to impact local businesses, schools, hospitals, parks, and residences.  \n\nIn determining the alternate case scenarios for ammonia, Jewel analyzed incidents occurring at other refrigeration facilities and the results of the internal process hazards analysis (PHA).  The scenario chosen for the ammonia system assumes a ?? hole in a liquid return pipe from the outside condensers on each of the refrigeration systems. Such a release from each system would create the potential"
