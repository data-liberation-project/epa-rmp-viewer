The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe primary purpose of the North Henderson Compressor Station is to compress, dehydrate and remove natural gas liquids from wet natural gas that is gathered from gas producers in the area.  The Station consists of refrigeration and treating processes and compressors driven by internal combustion engines.  Once at the Station, the incoming natural gas is sent through processes consisting of separation, dehydration, refrigeration, and compression.  The treated gas is compressed to pipeline pressure and dehydrated through a Triethylene Glycol dehydration process.  The residue gas leaves the facility via pipeline while the remaining natural gas liquids (NGL's) are stored in a pressurized bullet tanks.  The NGLs leave the plant via tank trucks.  As a result of these operations, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility.  The flammable substance inventory quantity provided in Section 1.17 of the RMP is a conservative estimate of the amount of regulated flammable substance that is present in the Station at any one time.  Although there are plans to add additional equipment, the actual inventory within the Station should not change significantly.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAn accidental release prevention"

      "SummaryText": " program is in place at the North Henderson Compressor Station.  The North Henderson Compressor Station has been classified as a Program 1 because no public receptors have been identified within a calculated radius of exposure.  After M2 Fairplay took over operations, it was determined that some processes at the Station are regulated by OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard due to the station being manned during daylight hours.  As such elements of PSM have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.  These elements include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency response, and compliance audits.  By implementing these PSM elements, accidental releases of regulated substances can be minimized.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe North Henderson Compressor Station has experienced NO known reportable process accidents in the past 5 years.  M2 Fairplay recently took over operations of the facility and were not made aware of any previous reportable accidents.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe North Henderson Compressor Station maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \n\nIn addition, the Station has procedures that address maintenance, inspec"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.\n\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Station processes or other Station facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel on the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the North Henderson Compressor Station is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LEPC is responsible for preparing the community?s emergency response plan.  The North Henderson Compressor Station has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBecause M2 Fairplay recently took over operations of the North Henderson Compressor Station, there are numerous plans in place to implement and improve safety and environmental programs.  An environmental, health, and safety (EH&S) training plan has been established and will be fully implemented in 2008.  Emergency drills will be conducted to improve personnel awareness and response.  PHA's are currently being planned on current and future processes.  Current and future equipment will be inspected to establish baseline data for mechanical integrity in order to provide a suitable testing frequency that meets industry standards."
