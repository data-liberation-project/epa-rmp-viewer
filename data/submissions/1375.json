The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unneccessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-worker and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine.  The safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the facilities chlorineStandard Operating and Emergency Procedures and Indian River County Emergency Plan for Hazardous Materials.  The emergency resonse plan includes procesures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat wastewater from the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used during the treatment process primarily to disinfect the effluent.  Chlorine is received by semi truck and unloaded by stationary crane.  The crane is load tested yearly by certified personnel.  The chlorine storage room only has access by authorized personnel.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nWorst-Case Scenario: Failure of 2-1 ton cylinders of chlorine with a release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: A vacuum line break.\nThe general accidental release "

This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.  \n\nFive year accident history.\nNo accidental releases of chlorine occurred during the last five-years.\n\nThe emergency response program.\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the plant's Standard Operating and Emergency Procedures and Indian River County Emergency Plan for Hazardous Materials.  Indian River County Fire Department has performed a release drill on a one ton cylinder on March 25, 1999.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\nThis facility was constructed in 1991 and is in compliance with Chlorine Institute guidelines.  We continue to participate in the Chlorine Institute programs and continue to improve our operations in accordance with RMP."
