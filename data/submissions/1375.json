              "Description": "The North Regional WWTF utilizes chlorine in the disinfection process of the treatment of the wastewater. Due to the inherent dangers in handling chlorine a prevention program has been established to reduce the risk to employees and the public. This program is comprised of several individual elements all of which are designed with the intent of preventing a chlorine gas release. At this facility the chlorine system has three injection points and will be considered as the same process. Identical equipment is used and procedures are the same. All prevention program elements are in place for each system The individual elements of the program are as follows:\n\n1. Process Hazard Analysis.\nA PHA was conducted on 4/15/99 and 4/16/99 at the North Regional Plant. This analysis determined the hazards present and recommendations were made to reduce the risks associated with the chlorine processes.\n2.  Operating Procedures.\nA written set of procedures has been developed to guide the operators of the system on how to startup, shutdown and normally operate the system. Procedures have also been developed to operate in either temporary or emergency conditions. The procedures cover operating limitations, safety and health considerations.\n3.  Training.\nAll operators receive initial training on the system and periodic training or refresher training to keep current with procedures and equipment. Each operator is trained with regard to the process, limitations, emergency response procedures, hazards and accepted work practices. All operators are tested to verify knowledge of the above.\n4.  Mechanical Integrity\nThis program documents the maintenance and inspection portion of the program. It insures that proper construction and materials have been used in installations with hazardoous materials.\n5.  Management of Change.\nAny change in the process, from materials to procedures, most undergo an evaluation or review prior to implementing in order to prevent accidents. Any changes must be documented.\n6.  Prestartup Review.\nAlthough similar to management of change, this element is designed more towards new or modified processes. The new process undergoes a review to insure design specifications meet applicable codes and construction meets standards.\n7.  Compliance Audits\nEvery three years audits are conducted to verify that all program elements are in place and being implemented.\n8.  Incident Investigations.\nAny incidents that may have resulted in an emergency situation must be reviewed. This investigation shall include corrective action, communication to staff and documentation of all findings.\n9.  Employee Participation.\nAll employees will have access to the RMP information and are encouraged to participate in the decision making process.\n10.  Hot Work Permit.\nAny welding or brazing process near a regulated process must be formally authorized and permitted.\n11.  Contractors.\nBefore contractor selection, an evaluation of the contractors' safety program must be completed. Contractors safety performance must be demonstrated through injury logs, training programs, etc.  A well defined procedure explaining contractor responsibilities concerning emergency action procedures msut be followed.",

The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unneccessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-worker and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine.  The safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the facilities chlorineStandard Operating and Emergency Procedures and Indian River County Emergency Plan for Hazardous Materials.  The emergency resonse plan includes procesures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat wastewater from the surrounding community.  Chlorine is used during the treatment process primarily to disinfect the effluent.  Chlorine is received by semi truck and unloaded by stationary crane.  The crane is load tested yearly by certified personnel.  The chlorine storage room only has access by authorized personnel.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nWorst-Case Scenario: Failure of 2-1 ton cylinders of chlorine with a release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: A vacuum line break.\nThe general accidental release "
