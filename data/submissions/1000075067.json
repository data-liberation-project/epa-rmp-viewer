Adams Station is a centralized storage location for the 1-ton chlorine containers and 150-lb Chlorine cylinders.  Chlorine containers and cylinders are shipped to the City of Alexandria's drinking water chlorination sites from the Adams Station.  A maximum of 29,050 pounds of chlorine are stored in one ton containers and 150-lb cylinders.  The City of Alexandria Adams Station is included in written community emergency response plan.  In case of a chlorine leak, the City of Alexandria has an emergency response policy which requires City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 center as well as local fire and police departments.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in evacuating citizens in the affected area.  Currently, the City uses daily inspection, leak detection and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is operating properly.  Plant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine stored in one ton containers and 150-lb cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination system.  On-going operator training and preventive maintenance continue to be key tools to ensure the safety of the public.  The City of Alexandria Water Department Adams Station has no history of reportable release for chlorine.  There have been no injury or property loss associated with this chemical at this site. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following provides a description of the risk management program at the City of Alexandria Water Department Adams Station. \n\n \n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Alexandria Water Department Adams Station is committed to the safety"
