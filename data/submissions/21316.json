The regulated substance is under the RMP ruling as Anhydrous Ammonia which is used in the refrigeration system.  It is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\nThe RMP at this facility involves development of a written emergency response plan and coordination with the Winnsboro Police and Fire Departments.  A written PSM has been developed and employees trained in operating procedures as well as emergency response procedures (HAZMAT training).  There are 3 trained HAZMAT teams.  Training also included police and fire department personnel to function as Incident Commanders.  Safety procedures have been developed for contractors for work done on site."
