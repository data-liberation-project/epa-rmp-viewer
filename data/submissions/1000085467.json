The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being\n\nimplemented and maintained.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Keenesburg Gas Plant is located near Keenesburg, Colorado. It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (i.e.: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas. There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the Keenesburg Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Midstream - Keenesburg Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific process safety management (PSM) program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM. The facility has also implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program that mirrors PSM requirements, where applicable, and integrates required aspects of public health and safety relative to plant operations.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Midstream - Keenesburg Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Midstream - Keenesburg Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also "

Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nRocky Mountain Midstream believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Discovery continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Discovery also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is a high priority.\n\n"
