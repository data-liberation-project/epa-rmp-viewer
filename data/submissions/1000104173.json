Executive Summary\nRisk Management Plan\nEPA Identifier:  1000 0019 1892\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\nAt Enterprise, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage complex, located in Gaines County, Texas, consist of the Hobbs Storage and Terminal Operations, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline system, propane storage/loading facility and underground cavern storage facility and the Hobbs Mixed Feed Fractionation facility, a mixed LPG fractionation plant.\n\nHobbs Storage and Terminal Operations facility has a number of interstate Department of Transportation regulated pipelines, plus additional intrastate pipelines, that are routed through the facility. These pipelines are mixed natural gas liquid lines (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), an ethane/propane or Y-Grade mixed liquids line and various other pipelines.

In addition, Enterprise has thirteen salt mined caverns for underground storage of hydrocarbons to/from interstate pipeline.  The product for these caverns comes to/from the various pipelines.  All of the pipelines, pumps and the underground storage at the facility are regulated by the Department of Transportation and are exempt from the RMP Regulation.  The truck terminal receives propane from a propane pipeline and delivers the propane into trucks for wholesale delivery and is RMP jurisdictional. \n\nThe Hobbs Mixed Feed Fractionation facility receives a mixed (Y-Grade) hydrocarbon liquid stream via pipeline and separates these liquids into relatively pure component streams via a fractional distillation plant. The fractionated ethane, propane (or Ethane/Propane mix), iso-butane, normal butane and gasoline products are removed from the fractionation facility via pipeline.\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage complex is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68. We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity. Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nListed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage consist of propane as a finished product which can be delivered from a D.O.T. regulated pipelines and routed from these pipelines to the truck transport loading docks for wholesale distribution to propane retailers.

The fractionation facility contains flammable methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane, normal pentane and propylene in a closed cooling system. \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage.

      "SummaryText": "procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Hobbs Terminal and Fractionation Plant is coordinated with the Gaines County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Hobbs Terminal and Fractionation Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Sheriff's Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Hobbs Terminal and Fractionation Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Hobbs Terminal, Fractionation & Storage.\n\n* No changes are planned."
