They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program is audited a minimum of every 3 years by our internal audit team to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nAtmospheric monitors for Boron Trichloride, Boron Trifluoride, Chlorine, Hydrogen Fluoride and Trichlorosilane are in place to detect leaks as a part of the plant's life safety system. This system is designed to stop the transfer of chemicals in the event of a leak.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe White City facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the past five years. There were no covered process releasees that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Programs\r\nThe White City facility has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public and the environment. The plan outlines what actions employees are to take when there is a chemical release. The plan complies with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and was coordinated with local emergency response agencies. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work annually. The Emergency Response Plan is tested and critiqued twice a year to ensure effectiveness and changes are made to the plan if deficiencies are found.
