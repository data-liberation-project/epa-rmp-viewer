In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance or a fire, Chevron Phillips Chemical would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies.

To the best of our knowledge we are in substantial compliance with the PSM and Coast Guard regulations.  This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment.  We are also in compliance with these regulations.  \n\nWe have had no RMP reportable accidents for any RMP regulated substances in the past 5 years at the Port Arthur Terminal.  \n\nChevron Phillips Chemical is constantly reviewing our plant's physical facilities and operations to maintain a safe place for our employees to work and to minimize environmental impacts.  Although we have adopted a program of continuous improvement, at this time, we currently have no plans to implement any major changes to our plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems.  The facility continually uses the MOC / PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical processes, and to determine if change will occur to the Alternative or Worst Case Release"

Port Arthur is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC.  The two members of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC are ChevronTexaco Corporation and ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company.   Both ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips are international petroleum and chemical companies.\n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal consists of a Dock & Storage facility and has the potential to store the following RMP regulated flammable substances (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, Naphtha).  All three regulated substances are mixtures.  The Propylene / Propane mixture is a feedstock that is received by barge and stored in bullets.  The PP is then used at other Chevron Phillips manufacturing plants.  The Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility are connected to each other and considered as (1) process unit and are remotely located from the CPChem manufacturing main plant.  The PP feedstock is transferred via pipeline from the bullets to the manufacturing plant.  The regulated substances, (Natural Gasoline and Naphtha) are brought in by pipeline and stored in the C-6 / C-16 tanks and used for feedstock at other CPChem manufacturing plants.  At any given time it will be possible to store one, or up to all three regulated substances on site.  This RMP only covers the Port Arthur Terminal Dock & Storage facility for the regulated substances (Propylene / Propane, Natural Gasoline, Naphtha).  There are no RMP regulated toxic materials above threshold quantities at the Port Arthur Terminal.  \n\nThe Port Arthur Terminal employs approximately (6) full time equivalent employees.  The facility is managed by Mr. Richard Cuneo, Plant Manager.  Mr. Ralph Edwards, Compliance Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this site.  \n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-722-4371) is the primary org"
