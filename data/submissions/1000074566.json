This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel with assistance from Van Field personnel and the Van Volunteer Fire Department will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant, located in Van, TX, operates a process to produce petroleum product called NGL.  The Van Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, including propane.  The Van Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances.\r\n\r\n\tOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\n\tThe worst-case release scenario at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion involving the maximum normal inventory of the NGL Storage Vessel, MAY-108, which contains flammable natural gas liquids (C3+) above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The liquid level in the NGL Storage Tank is managed through administrative procedures that require loading of NGL product to tanker trucks prior to reaching the level safety high-high (LSHH) limit of 8 feet. Liquid level is monitored through: 1) operator routine duties (ORD) to check the level bridle, and 2) a level transmitter and corresponding alarms connected to the facility PLC.\r\nThe maximum distance to the 1 psi ovepressure endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is 0.8 miles, resulting in offsite impact. Credit for active or passive mitigation measures was not considered in this analysis.\r\n\r\n\tThe alternative release scenario at the facility is a vapor"

This scenario assumes a 2 diameter hole forms at the NGL Storage Vessel, MAY-108, resulting in the flash and release of a liquified gas under pressure at a rate of 7,094 lb/min. The release through a  2 diameter hole could be a result of process piping or vessel failures at flanges, joints, or welds at NGL Storage Vessel, MAY-108. Released gas is a dense vapor with a maximum LFL of 36 mg/L. Topography is conservatively assumed to be urban. Time of release is a minimum duration of 10 minutes, with a maximum duration of 21 minutes to de-inventory the NGL Storage Vessel, MAY-108. Reported release quantity of 70,941 pounds represents operator intervention after 10 minutes. Otherwise, a complete vessel de-inventory of 147,960 pounds occurs after 21 minutes.\r\nThe maximum distance to the LFL endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles, which does not result in offsite impact. Credit for active or passive mitigation measures was not considered in this analysis.\r\n\r\n\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\tThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because the process at the Gas plant that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n\tEmployee Participation\r\n\r\n\tThe the management at the Van Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \r\n\r\n\tProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A  library for the reference documents  is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\n\tChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).  This information's supplemented by documents, if applicable, that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-rated limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a operating manual  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant conducts studies help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this studies, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant uses the HazOP methodology on these studies.  The studies are conducted using a team of people that will be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology used.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\n\tThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n\t \r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\n\tIn addition, the Van Gas Plant maintains a  operating manual that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and fro other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\n\tTraining\r\n\r\n\tTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Van Gas Plant utilizes a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration)  they possess adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe m"

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\n\tContractors\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplishing by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Van Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor, along with historical data from our locations.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\n\tPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in acc"

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\n\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\n\tThe Van Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and test, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\n\tMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and test are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Van Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and"
