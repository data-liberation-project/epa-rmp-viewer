Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Ona Polymers Garland Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Ona Polymers requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\n2. General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard and implementation of of Loss Prevention Principles (LPP) which consist of design, installation, modification and operating practices that relate to process safety and loss prevention.  Key elements include:\n\n\n\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\n\n\n\nLoss Prevention Principles (LPP)/Operational Safety Standards: Consist of design, installation, modification and operating practices that relate to process safety and loss prevention. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are maintained up-t"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standards that these management systems set.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n3. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Ona Polymers Garland Plant that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n4. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Ona Polymers Garland plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n\n\n? Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n\n\n\n? Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n\n\n\n? Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n\n\n\n? Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\n\n\n? Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\n\n\n5. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  \n\n\n\nThe company will increase efficiency by leveraging across the businesses most effective technology (MET), standardized work processes defined using Six Sigma, and other best practices. \n\n\n\nTo continuously enhance reso"
