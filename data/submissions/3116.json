General accidental release and prevention policy of Performance Food Group.\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions during it's use to prevent human exposure, reduce the threat to our workers personal\nhealth, the surrounding community and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all\napplicable federal and state regulations.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of\nammonia combined with the safety devices that are incorporated in our facility and the safe\nhandling procedures that our personnel are trained in.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nPerformance Food Group, 500 Metro Parkway, McKinney, Texas is responsible for the storage\nand distribution of various frozen food products.  There are approximately 90 employees at this\nfacility which includes hourly and salary personnel.  This distribution facility receives and prepares\nshipment of refrigerated food products via tractor trailers up to 24 hours a day, seven days a\nweek, if shipping workload demands.  \n\nPerformance Food Group is located in an industrial park approximately 2.5 miles north north-\nwest of the city of McKinney, Texas.  In addition to our distribution facility the industrial park\nalso houses other manufacturing or business facilities.  \n\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the Performance Food Group facility is\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcent"

The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.   \nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\nbut only in a very narrow, high concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition\nsource.\n\nThe normal operating level of ammonia that is used/stored at the Performance Food Group facility\nis 10,500  pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the chemical in the refrigeration process.
