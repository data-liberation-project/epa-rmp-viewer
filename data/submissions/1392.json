      "SummaryText": "Midwest City's Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) is a domestic sewage treatment facility that uses physical/biological forms of pollution control.  Designed as a Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC) facility, it will treat up to twelve million gallons per day at the required secondary level.\n\nWhen the wastewater enters the plant, large pumps lift the water to the grit removal/aeration basins that allow settling and removal of heavier particles.  From there, it gravity flows to the primary clarifiers where settleable solids or sludge settles and is pumped to anaerobic digesters.  The wastewater then flows to the RBCs which removes most of the dissolved organic content using a biomass of microorganisms growing naturally on the RBC biodisks.  \n\nNext, the biologically treated wastewater flows to secondary clarifiers where the biomass that sloughed off the RBCs settles and is pumped to the primary clarifiers.  This sloughed biomass is called humus.  RBCs naturally control their amount of biomass by sloughing off excess humus.\n\nAfter secondary clarification, the wastewater flows to a chlorine contact basin where chlorine is added to disinfect wastewater to desired levels.  The chlorinated wastewater then flows into the dechlorination basin where sulfur dioxide is added to remove the free and combined chlorine residuals.  Finally the wastewater flows down a \"stairstep\" type of waterfall to aerate the water before it flows out into Crutcho Creek.\n\nAnaerobic digestion allows for further biological or natural treatment of the solids or sludge removed from the wastewater.  The anaerobic process uses naturally occurring organisms in the absence of oxygen to reduce the level organics and pathogenic organisms.  Midwest City applies this treated and stabilized sludge to permitted farmland for growing healthy crops.\n\nByproducts of the anaerobic digestion process are methane gas, carbon dioxide, and a small amount of hydrogen sulfide.  Midwest City's WWTF uses the methane for heat"

They receive an understanding of the physical and chemical health hazards that may be encountered on the job.  This in turn allows them to protect themselves and their environment from potential hazards.\n\nMidwest City provides annual Hazcom training to all employees.  New employees receive initial training within thirty days of employment.  To attain the goals and objectives of Hazcom training, Midwest City uses audiovisual and written reference material.  Testing is then used to help each employee retain the necessary information. \n\nA plat of the plant is available to help Hazmat teams and other city agencies.  It shows where chemicals/products are stored and used.  Midwest City provides safety equipment, such as safety glasses, gloves, and self contained breathing apparatus, to the employees and requires them to use the equipment as necessary.\n\nMidwest City's WWTF regularly uses chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide arrives at the facility in 1 ton (2000 pound) cylinders.  A maximum of 8,000 pounds of each may be present.  In the past five years there has been no accidental release at Midwest City's WWTF.\n \nA worse case scenario for Midwest City's WWTF is an accidental chlorine gas release.  A worse case would be if 2000 pounds were released at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for ten minutes and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  About twenty-five hundred people around the area would need evacuated and the Fire Department and Hazmat Team would be notified.  The same procedures apply for an accidental sulfur dioxide gas release.  \n\nTo help prevent an accidental release from occurring, personnel inspects all containers when they arrive.  All personnel are trained on container safety and po"

When they arrive, site control and remediation will be turned over to them.

They plan to continue training and awareness for plant personnel and to the public."
