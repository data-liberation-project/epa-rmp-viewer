Ashdown Mill Program Level 3 prevention program that addresses the EPA RMP Rule prevention program requirements for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System.\n \n 1. Employee Participation.  The facility has developed a written employee participation program for the covered process to help ensure that the safety concerns of Ashdown MIll employees are addressed. The facility encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP Rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n \n 2. Process Safety Information.  The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the processes. The documents address (1) the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, (2) the technology data of the process and (3) the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the processes. The facility ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all Ashdown Mill employees, and the LEPC. All of the information and documentation for the RMP Prevention Program is maintained in the PSM/RMP Center at the facility.\n \n Material safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility, including non-regulated substances in the covered process. MSDS's for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the control rooms so the operators have ready access to this information. In addition, MSDS's are provided to the LEPC and/"

One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation, 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at Domtar Industries Inc. in Ashdown. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide) - see topic 1.2\n \n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n \n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n4. A management system that assigns responsibility for specific elements of the program.  These elements include the preparation and maintenance of the hazards assessment, accident prevention program (including OSHA PSM), and emergency response plan; RMPlan preparation, submittal, a"

Ashdown employees work as a responsible and accountable team, ensuring that the Mill operates in a safe and reliable manner, protecting workers, the community, and the environment.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at Ashdown Mill. In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n\nAshdown Mill minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nAshdown Mill limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to reduce the potential for injuries and/or environmental damage to occur in the event of a release. \n\nThe safety program at Ashdown Mill consists of a number of elements, of which, only some are required by the RMP Rule. This RMP is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAshdown Mill is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention o"

These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment. Ashdown Mill provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the General Manager.\n\n\n1.2 Domtar Industries Inc.Ashdown Mill and Our Regulated Substances\n\nDomtar Industries Inc. Ashdown Mill is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (Cl02) for the use of bleaching pulp. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3.\n\n\n1.3 Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAshdown Mill performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case and alternative release case scenarios. The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Ashdown Mill and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the r"

The alternative release scenario will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the end- point distance). The various health effects could occur at the endpoint distances. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects could be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Domtar Industries Inc. Ashdown Mill. These requirements include:\n\n           one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario  representing chlorine dioxide)\n           one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n \n The following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Domtar Industries Ashdown Mill.\n \n \n 1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process- The Chlorine Dioxide (C102) Solution System\n \n The worst-case release scenario for the chlorine dioxide system is the rupture of the No. 8 ClO2 Storage tank (13.27 tons of ClO2). The RMP Rule mandates, that for the worst-case scenario, the analysis assumes loss of the largest storage vessel in ten minutes.

During normal operations, the pump could pump approximately 940 gallons per minute for five minutes before the release might be recognized and isolated. The released chlorine dioxide solution will form a pool of minimum depth (1 cm) and evaporate to form a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, based on the EPA RMPComp software, is 1.9 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 1,300 people live within this distance from the discharge line at the chlorine dioxide solution transfer pumps. Several public receptors are also located within this distance including the Ashdown Junior and Senior High Schools, the Pleasant Manor Nursing Home, Little River Memorial Hospital, Little River Nursing Home, Ashdown City Park, and several local churches and public shopping parking lots.\n \n \n 1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n \n Domtar Industries Inc. Ashdown Mill  has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.

Chlorine Dioxide is produced at the facility and stored as a diluted aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution. Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where as high as 12.0 gram-per-liter (1.2 wt.%) strength in solution is absorbed.\n \n 1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n \n 1.5.1 Chlorine Dioxide\n There was one accident within the last five years involving the release of chlorine dioxide which resulted in an injury to a contractor employee.  This release was limited to three minutes due to the quick reaction of our employees.  The contractor employee was working in a pipe rack when he accidentally struck  a valve handle on a washout line.  This accident caused the valve to crack open and release a small amount of ClO2 solution and ClO2 gas.  Because of the location, the individual could not evacuate quickly and he inhaled some ClO2 vapors.  He was treated locally for gas inhalation by emergency personnel and was transported to a hospital for treatment.  It was estimated that no more than ten pounds of ClO2 gas was released with no offsite consequences.  An accident investigation revealed that the cause was human error, however steps were taken to prevent recurrence. \n\nThere was one accident within the last five years involving chlorine dioxide which resulted in an injury to an employee.

Investigation showed 1.0 ppm of chlorine dioxide to be present in the area he was working.  The addition of chlorine dioxide to the paper machine was shut off.  Investigation into the accident revealed:  a malfunction had occurred in the chlorine dioxide dilution system, there had been a change in the addition of the chlorine dioxide distribution, another machine using chlorine dioxide reduced its usage that morning, and personnel were working in an area not normally occupied.  Steps were taken to address each of these causes. \n \n  \n 1.6 Emergency Response Programs\n \n Domtar Industries Inc.
