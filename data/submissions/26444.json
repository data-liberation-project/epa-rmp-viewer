Wichita plant is submitting this document as a RMP Update to it's original, submitted 06/02/1999,  in accordance with 68.190 which stipulates submission be made within six months following any change which would require a hazards review.  A hazards review was performed on 02/11/2002 for the additon of new refrigeration equipment which increased the plant's ammonia inventory. The incident scenerios and endpoint numbers were not affected by the modifications.\n \nFarmland Foods' Wichita Meat Processing Plant is located in south central Kansas, in the city of Wichita, Kansas.  The plant manufactures processed meats that provide consumers with high-quality meat products.  This facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan submission to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenerios, a five year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nFACILITY SNAPSHOT\nThis 176,000 sq ft, concrete and steel facility was constructed in 1974 and was owned and operated by Safeway, Inc. prior to Farmland's acquisition of the plant in 1989.  The plant produces over 145 million pounds of product annually.\n\nIMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY\n  *  Farmland employs 500 area residents at a combined annual salary of approximately $14 million.\n  *  The facility purchases over $6 milion of utilities, including electricity, natural gas, water and  \n      wastewater treatment\n  *  The facility pays over $300,000 annually in local taxes.\n\nEMPLOYEE SNAPSHOT\n\nFarmland employees are involved in community activites and organizations.

Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of it's employees, and to the safety of the general public.\n\nTo achieve it's goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committeted to the following:\n  *  A knowledgeable and highly trained and motivated employee group\n  *  A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n  *  Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate\n  *  Employee involvement in safety committees which contribute greatly to safety programs and practices\n  *  Preparation and training for emergency response and mitigation\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is the only process at this facility which is covered by the EPA Risk Management Plan regulation.\n\nA consultant's recalculation of the facility's ammonia capacity, using International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines, has revealed the ammonia inventory to correctly be 46,961 pounds.  This is a closed, contained system, in which the ammonia is recirculated to refrigerate the meat processing and storage areas in the plant.\n\nSYNOPSIS OF WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENERIOS\n\nThe Risk Mangement rule requires a hazard analysis for worst-case and alternate release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For the facility, one regulated toxic substance is included, anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst-case event, unless sm"

This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or could even reasonably occur.  It should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst-case sceneario is extremly low.\n\nAlternate scenerios, for each regulated toxic and flammable substance, which are more likely events, must also be presented.  More likely release events tend to concentrate in areas such as failure of smaller valves, lines and hoses.  Significantly lower quantities are involved and operator intervention would tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures.\n\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE - AMMONIA\n\nThe largest ammonia vessel on this site has not changed due to systems modifications.  It is an 8000 pound capaciaty collector which is outside, directly north of the building.  The worst-case scenerio assumes that this entire amount would be released in 10 minutes as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  The worst-case scenerio would reach offsite endpoints, including public and environmental receptors.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE TOXIC - AMMONIA\n\nThis alternate release scenario consist of a pipe leak, which discharges 1,300 pounds of ammonia in 20 minutes prior to the operator stopping the leak.  This scenerio would reach offsite endpoints and would effect public and environmental receptors.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at this plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore, under EPA Risk Management Rule, this is a Program Level 3 process.  The OSHA Process Safety Management Programs are in place for these processes, which constitute the Program Level 3 Prevention Programs.\n\nThe plant adheres to the requirements of Process Safety Management and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of Process Safety Management and EPA Preven"
