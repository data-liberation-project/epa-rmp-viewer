The Accidential Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\n\r\n5. The Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been no accident history in the last five years\r\n\r\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has a current Emergency Action Plan (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38) in place and has coordinated this program with the Bushnell Fire Dept. and with the McDonough Co. LEPC.  We train our staff on the elements found in our response program (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120) and have invited the fire department to visit our facility in order to provide them with a working knowledge of our plant's layout and our storage facility.  This facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\r\n\r\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."

The Facility Policy\r\n\r\nThe owners, management and employees of Serven Fertilizer, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Bushnell Fire Dept., McDonough Co. LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 25,600 gallons (or 119,629 lbs.) in our storage tank(s), consisting of 2 - 12,000 gallon tanks and 2 - 800 gallon tanks.  The maximum quanitity handled in the largest tank (1-12,000 Gal bulk Ammonia Storage tank) would be 56078 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. The two 12,000 gallon tanks are manifolded together; however, in the worst case release scenario valves prevent the release of more than one tank.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\r\n\r\nWorse-Case:  The worse-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56078 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 4.4 miles, which would encompass an area of 60.7 sq. miles, with the potential of impacting approximately 3,779 persons in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case:  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a 2 inch diameter transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion of 200 ppm) is 1.3 miles, which would encompass an area of 5."
