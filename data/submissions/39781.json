In accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the update has been prepared within 5 years of the date of the original submittal.  [The plan was last submitted to the Torrance Fire Department (the Administering Agency) in June 1999.]\nThe following activities were conducted in support of the RMP Update, in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP guidance for updates:\n\n> A three year compliance audit was conducted by an outside environmental contractor, in accordance with Section 2760.8 of the CalARP regulations.\n> The Offsite Consequence Analysis was revised using a current version of RMP*CompTM.  The affected population and list of sensitive receptors was revised using current population data and other resources.\n> The seismic analysis for the affected systems was reviewed for changes to the system, changes to the building codes that may impact affected systems, and implementation of recommendations made in the last seismic review.\n\nIn addition, Dow Chemical has revised the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for the facility using a proprietary technique, and the external events analysis was expanded to include a qualitative evaluation of a variety of external events not previously discussed in the PHA.\nThe facility has changed ownership since the previous RMP was submitted and many of the various plans and programs referenced in the RMP have been revised.  Dow has prepared a new RMP registration submittal to reflect these changes to the RMP.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nDow Chemical Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.

These programs include both Dow Chemical's Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as EPA\u00bfs RMP rule and the CalARP RMP requirements.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nDow Chemical Corporation, UCAR\u00ae Emulsion Systems, located in Torrance, California, operates a latex emulsion manufacturing facility that produces more than 100 million pounds of latex per year. The water-borne latex produced at this site is utilized by the coatings industry to make latex-based paints, caulks, adhesives and sealants. The facility is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of regulated substances listed in the RMP rule above the applicable thresholds. The UCAR\u00ae Emulsion Systems facility does not maintain specified quantities of any RMP regulated flammable substances, but does utilize the following RMP regulated toxic substances at levels above threshold limits: \n\n> Acrylonitrile (2-Propenenitrile) (CAS 108-05-4)\n> Vinyl Acetate monomer (VAM) (Acetic Acid ethenyl ester) (CAS 107-13-1)\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  EPA defines alternative release scenarios as scenarios that are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and that reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  One or more alternative release scenarios are evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or active mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.\nPrediction"

RMP*Comp\u00bf is an electronic tool to make the same calculations performed manually by following the procedures described in EPA\u00bfs guidance document, RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (April, 1999).  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\nVAM is not stored on the UCAR\u00ae facility but rather is fed by pipeline on an as-needed basis for batch processing during the manufacturer of latex.  Monomer mix tank number 4 (MMT-4) can hold the largest quantity of VAM, 4,500 gallons. The monomer mixing area is surrounded by a small dike sufficient to contain the contents of a spill of the maximum amount of VAM on-site in a monomer mixing tank.  The dike dimensions are approximately 50 feet by 50 feet by 4 inches deep.   Acrylonitrile is stored on-site in a 10,000-gallon storage tank.  Acrylonitrile is delivered to the facility by tanker truck with a nominal capacity of 5,600 gallons.  The acrylonitrile tank is located inside a 20 foot by 40 foot by 2 feet deep concrete containment area that can hold the contents of the tank plus freeboard for storm water and fire protection water. \nThe worst-case release of VAM assumes the catastrophic failure of MMT-4 during a seismic event.  The worst-case meteorological conditions defined by EPA for the worst-case release are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s) and a stability class of F (very stable).  For VAM, the worst-case distance to the threshold concentration of 0.26 mg/l is 0.7 miles (1,100 meters).\nThe worst-case release of acrylonitrile assumes the catastrophic failure of the acrylonitrile tank during a seismic event.  The worst-case acrylonitrile distance to the threshold concentration of 0.076 mg/l is also 0.7 miles (1,100 meters). \n\nAlternative-Release Scenarios\nOne alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile was assessed.  Acrylonitrile alternative scenario #1 consists of an unconfined"

The release is assumed to occur inside the spill containment area surrounding the monomer mix tanks. The alternative meteorological conditions defined by EPA for alternative releases are a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second (m/s) and a stability class of D (neutral). The distance to the acrylonitrile threshold concentration of 0.076 mg/l for alternative release scenario #1 is 0.2 miles (300 meters).\nTwo alternative release scenarios for VAM were assessed.  VAM alternative scenario #1 consists of an unconfined release from the three-inch pipeline from the Dow Torrance Distribution Terminal to the monomer mix tank area.  The distance to the threshold concentration of 0.26 mg/l is 0.2 miles (300 meters) for VAM alternative scenario #1.  VAM alternative scenario #2 assumes an open \u00be-inch drain valve on the discharge side of a pump while transferring VAM to an intermediate mix tank.  The distance to the threshold for VAM alternative scenario 2 is 0.2 miles (300 meters).\nA total of 7,100 persons in 2,650 households reside within the VAM and acrylonitrile worst-case impact distance, based on the 2000 Census data.  The sensitive receptors within 0.7 miles of the facility include schools, parks, and recreational areas.  Other potential receptors include industrial facilities and major commercial facilities.  For the alternative impact distance of 0.2 miles, there are no sensitive receptors.  The estimated population potentially effected by the alternative release scenario is an estimated 100 persons.  \n\nMitigation\nThe specific systems to prevent the worst-case release scenario of acrylonitrile from occurring, as well as mitigate its effects should they occur, include: \n\n> Hydrocarbon Gas Detector and Alarm Systems: This system is designed to detect toxic vapor releases and to automatically activate alarm systems to alert operations personnel of a possible eme"

Due to the fact that some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they might find during their work. \n\nEmployee Participation \nDow Chemical encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, employees participate in keeping process safety information up to date by making periodic inspections, having an active role in writing operating procedures and being involved in many other aspects of the accident prevention program, such as incident investigations. \n\nEpisodic Risk Management System \nPeriodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards that could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence. These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques. \n\nEquipment Design \nVessels (including shi"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident by reviewing facts and developing corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. \n\nManagement of Change \nDow Chemical has a comprehensive system to ensure that modified facilities and processes will be safe to operate. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. \n\nMechanical Integrity \nDow Chemical has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\nOperating Procedures \nDow Chemical maintains written procedures that provide detail on how to safely operate a process, including various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed"

In addition, the plant maintains specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely. The plant also trains persons who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipment. \nOperational Safety Program \nDow Chemical has a comprehensive program to ensure that all the elements listed within this accidental release prevention program are implemented at every Dow Chemical location. This Program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements. \n\nOperational Safety Standards \nDesign requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operational safety standards. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \nDow Chemical conducts reviews just prior to startup to ensure that new and modified facilities and processes are safe for operation. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nDow conducted an internal audit of the UCAR\u00ae Emulsions Systems Torrance facility in 2002.  A PHA was conducted during the audit using Dow\u00bfs proprietary \u00bfReactive Chemical Process Hazard Analysis\u00bf (RCPHA).  RCPHA Software version 4.0 (Revised 1/10/01) was used in the review.  The staff performing the RCPHA were Joe Sokolik, Ron Weber, Don Eastepp, Pete Allen, Roger Graves, Erwin Morfe, and Al Fedoruk.  \nThe RCPHA methodology consists of a checklist designed by Dow for use in internal reactive chemical and PHA audits.  For each question in the questionnaire, there are columns for a yes/no/not applicable response, a response column, columns to check the work discipline affected, and an action item column.  In addition to the RCPHA questionnaire, there is a second questionn"

There were no significant findings that were identified during the RCPHA or during ENSR\u00bfs review of the RCPHA.  All action items established during the RCPHA audit have been assigned for follow-up by the Facility Manager.  Most items had a target completion data of December 31, 2003.  The remaining four items have a target completion date within the first half of 2004.  The final RCPHA report contained the following four comments:\n\n1. The facility is well run with most process safety and reactive chemical issues suitably addressed.\n2. The safety and loss prevention practices and requirements from the Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) organization remain in place and are being well followed.\n3. There are differences in engineering practices between UCC and Dow that are being addressed on a prioritized basis.\n4. There are a number of new Dow requirements that now apply to the UCAR\u00ae facility and a plan is in place to implement these new requirements\n\nENSR Corporation reviewed the seismic assessment portion of the Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) (June 1999) prepared for the Union Carbide Emulsion Systems Facility.  After the review, ENSR conducted a walkthrough at the facility to confirm whether modifications recommended in the 1999 assessment had been completed.  \n\nExternal Events Analysis\nThe 1999 RMPP seismic assessment of the facility estimated the seismic vulnerability of vessels, piping, and associated equipment and structures containing regulated substances (i.e. acrylonitrile and VAM).

The 1999 RMPP seismic review was performed according to the requirements in the 1998 Guidance for CalARP Seismic Assessment.  [The 1998 guidance is the current version of the guidance.]\nBased on a review of the recommendations provided in the 1999 seismic assessment, and a walkthrough of the facility, it appears that all of the recommended modifications have not been adequately implemented.  The recommended modifications to the mixed monomer tanks and the power feed tank #3 have not been implemented as these units are scheduled to be removed at some unspecified date in the future.  However, the mixed monomer tanks and the power feed tank #3 are currently vulnerable to earthquake ground shaking and should be upgraded as previously recommended unless they are to be removed in the near future.\n\nProcess Safety Information \nDow Chemical keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date and available to operating personnel. \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure and level control) in the Operational Safety Standard (OSS) documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, automated operating systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument system (i.e., automated shutdown systems). \nThe facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a hot work permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\nTraining/Certification Programs \nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Dow Chemical has implemented a comprehensive training and certification program for all employees involved in operating a process. After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified to work independently.  In addition, trained technical staff is available 24 hours a day to support operations. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving a release of either VAM or acrylonitrile from affected systems at the facility that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nThe Dow Chemical facility maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.
