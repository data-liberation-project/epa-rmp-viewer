The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nNevada County Sanitation District No. 1 owns and operates several wastewater treatment and reclamation facilities in Navada County.  Its wastewater treatment facility, Lake of the Pines Wastewater Treatment Plant, is located at 10803 Riata Way, Lake of the Pines, CA in Nevada County, and uses chlorine, a RS, for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located at the edge of a housing subdivision.  There are 2 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with a trolley hoist, and stored on a container scale inside a building.  The chlorine is used to control biological growth on the filters and"

The chlorine under vacuum is piped into an adjacent room where it is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.  Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection and dechlorination process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1's operations.  The program and document management"

These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNevada County Sanitation District No. 1's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Nevada County Department of Environmental Health, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at its wastewater treatment and reclamation plant sites. Public agency First Responders have participated with Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 personnel in response drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Nevada County Sanitation District No. 1 committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.  Chlorine will be eliminated as a process chemical at this plant at the time of the next plant upgrade."
