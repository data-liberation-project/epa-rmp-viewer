This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the LPG Railcar Storage and Transloading process (Program Level 3) which includes the storage of up to 24 propane or butane railcars and provisions to transfer propane and butane from railcar to transport truck using portable transloading units.\n\nTristar complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119). This LPG  Railcar Storage and Transloading process is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\nTristar maintains an Emergency Action Plan and has been designated a non-responding facility. As such, in the event of an emergency involving the LPG Railcar Storage and Transloading process, it is the policy of the Facility to evacuate personnel and contact the Vancouver Fire Department to request their assistance. Facility personnel have received emergency response training and all contractors and visitors are briefed on appropriate emergency actions prior to being permitted onsite.\n\nTristar has coordinated their Emergency Action Plan with the Vancouver Fire Department. In addition, representatives from the Vancouver Fire Department have attended onsite orientation/training.\n\nThis Facility has never had an accident involving LPG which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in-place.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Tristar looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. Additionally, Tristar coordinates response actions with the local agencies annually at m"
