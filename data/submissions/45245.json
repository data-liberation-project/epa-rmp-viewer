      "SummaryText": "Compressor Station #103, (CS-103) is located approximately 30 miles south of Havre, Montana, in the SE1/4 of the SE1/4 of Section 8, Township 27 North, Range 19 East, Blaine County, Montana.  It is operated by Devon Louisiana Corporation.  CS-103 performs three primary functions which may be classified as four processes.  The first process is to gather and compress nearby field gas, which is accomplished through the use of natural gas-driven compressor engines.  The second process is to remove moisture from the gas prior to its entering the transmission system through the use of a dehydrator unit.  The third process is to cool the gas to remove the heavier light hydrocarbons from the gas stream in order to meet pipeline natural gas quality standards.\n\nThe fourth process comprises the on-site storage of the hydrocarbons (also called LPG mix) that are removed from the gas stream.  The LPG mix is stored on-site until a maximum quantity of 60% of tank capacity has been accumulated in a pressurized storage tank.  The storage tank has a maximum capacity of 18,000 gallons and a design MAOP of 250 psi.  The normal storage pressure is approximately 40 psi.  The contents of the tank are removed from the site when it reaches 60 percent of capacity.  The contents of the LPG is typically a mix of methane, propane, butane and pentane and other heavier hydrocarbon liquids. Pentane is the largest constituent. Assuming the density of liquid pentane is approximately 5.25 lbs per gallon, the maximum amount of LPG mix on site would be 56,700 lbs. The National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) 704 flammability rating of the LPG mixture is 4, making the mixture potentially subject to 40 CFR 68 rules.\n\nThe LPG storage tank is newly installed, therefore, there has not been an accidental release at CS-103 in the past 5 years.  Since there are no public receptors within the 1 psi overpressure distance and there have been no accidental releases in the past 5 years, this process is eligible f"

      "SummaryText": "or Program 1.  \n\nThe written Emergency Response Plan for Devon Louisiana covers CS-103. The plan includes hazard identification, hazard assessment, providing relevant safety information (hazard communication program), protective measures information, coordination with local emergency officals, and annual review and effectiveness of the plan. Records are maintained at the local field office related to the site specific safety program, training records and documentaion of annual review. The accident prevention procedures at CS-103 are in accordance with the NFPA LP-Gas Code 58 and other applicable state and local laws. \n\nThe last safety inspection of the site was in Oct 2005 by a private company, Safety Management Systems."
