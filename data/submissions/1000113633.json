The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Splitter III facility is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu group, which includes the Mont Belvieu police, fire department, and Emergency Medical Service, as well as the Chambers County Emergency Management System (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Splitter III facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Splitter III facility resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Splitter III facility.\n\n* No changes are planned."

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Splitter III facility has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire detectors on gas compression equipment\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Fire fighting system including fire water storage, diesel driven fire water pumps, and fixed fire monitors.\n* Hand-held and wheeled cart fire extinguishers\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteri"

We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Splitter III facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design of the proposed process vessels. Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Splitter III facility are Propane/Propylene Mix, Propane Product, and Propylene Product.  Due to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Splitter III facility is being registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 1 facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Splitter III facility.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Splitter III facility facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at no"

The Propane/Propylene mixture is fed to the facility via pipelines from underground storage wells where the two components are separated via distillation. The Propylene product is fed through the Bay Area Pipeline for distribution to downstream customers. The remaining Propane joins with Propane product from the adjacent Enterprise facility and is shipped to downstream customers via pipelines, rail cars and/or trucks.\n\nThe Propylene Processing Unit process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40"
