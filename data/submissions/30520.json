The Facility Plan\n\nThe Board of Directors, management and employees of the Farmers Co-op of Hanska (the facility) are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.If an accidental release of anhydrous should occur, the Farmers Co-op of Hanska is prepared to work with the Hanska Community Fire Department, or other authorities, to midigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activities at this facility are the stroage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers .\n\n-ANHYDROUS AMMONIA is received, stored, distributed and custom applied for crop production.\n\n-The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility would be 580,000 lbs. This figure is based on three storage tanks, 64 nurse tanks and five caddy applicators.The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a semi transport truck holding 41,500 lbs.\n\n   \n\n3. The accidental release prevention  program\n\n  The Farmers Co-op of Hanska has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", publised by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) , 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia \".Rules and regulations set forth by the MN Dept. of Ag.\n\n4. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n   - Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the Farmers Co-op of Hanska; nor\n   -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.
