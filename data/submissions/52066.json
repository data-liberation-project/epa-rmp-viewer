Modeling procedures followed EPA guidance to identify worst case release scenarios (WCS) and alternate case release scenarios (ACS) as defined by the RM regulations to determine toxic endpoints.  The WCSs were identified by comparing the results for each ammonia and chlorine system and selecting the scenario that resulted in the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The number of offsite permanent residents located inside a circle (centered on the release point with a radius equal to the endpoint) was then estimated using EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp version 1.07 software .  \n\nA release of 87,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes was identified as the WCS for the brewery ammonia refrigeration process.  This WCS would produce an endpoint (defined as 200 parts per million [ppm] ammonia) of 4.0 miles.  An estimated offsite population of 62,000  is located within this radius.  \n\nIn the past five years, none of the processes subject to RM regulations has had releases that have resulted in offsite property damage or offsite health consequences requiring medical treatment for chemical releases.  There has been one reportable quantity release that occurred on June 26, 2005.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe prevention programs for the covered processes were developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119).\n\nFor the covered processes (which are subject to the PSM standard), EPA requires a Program 3 prevention program with 12 specific elements as listed below and described in Section 3.0:\n\n1.\tEmployee Participation\n\t2.\tProcess Safety Information\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\t4.\tOperating Procedures\n5.\tContractors\n\t6.\tPre-Startup Safety Review\n7.\tTraining\n\t8.\tMechanical Integrity\n9.\tHot Work Permit\n\t10.\tManagement of Change\n11.\tIncident Investigation\n\t12.\tCompliance Audits\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe emergency response program is based on the Emergency Action Plan requir"

When external emergency responders are needed, a joint command is then established which is led by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) and supported by CBC personnel.
