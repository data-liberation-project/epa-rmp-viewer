This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention as evidenced in the training programs and in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  It is the policy of SESA to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b)\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nShin-Etsu Silicones of America (SESA) manufactures carbon functional silane compounds.  Per 40 CFR ?68.115 a threshold quantity of a regulated substance listed in ?68.130 is present at a stationary source if the total quantity of the regulated substance contained in a process exceeds the threshold.  The following table lists the ?68.130 toxic and flammable chemicals that may be onsite and an estimate of the amount of the chemicals onsite at any given time.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical/Type\n40 CFR 68 Threshold Quantity\n\n(lbs)\nEstimated Onsite Quantities (lbs)\nPSM Status\n\n(40 CFR 1910.119)\nTrichlorosilane/Flammable\n10,000\n576,00\nApplicable (Listed Chemical)\nAcrylonitrile/Toxic\n20,000\n81,000\nApplicable (Flammable)\nHydrogen Sulfide/Toxic\n10,000\n12,100\nApplicable (Listed Chemical)\nPropylene Oxide/Toxic\n10,000\n62,300\nApplicable (Flammable)\n\n\nBased on this information the regulated substances under the RMP are trichlorosilane, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and hydrogen sulfide.  There are no other toxic or flammable materials on-site which exceed RMP threshold levels.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 the offsite consequence analysis must include the worst-case release quantity which is defined as the greater of the following:\n\n(1) For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity; or\n\n(2) For substances in pipes,"

Acrylonitrile\n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile is normally liquid at ambient temperature.  SESA assumed that the quantity in the largest storage vessel is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The largest volume of acrylonitrile is in a horizontal storage vessel (TK-1003) placed in a concrete containment system with a floor area measuring 14? 4? by 49.5?.  The containment floor surface area is 709.5 sq. ft.  A spill of the entire tank (12,000 gallons) is equivalent to 1,604 cubic feet.  The resulting liquid depth would be 2.26 feet (27.13 inches).\n\n\n\nThe rate of release to the air was determined from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool. SESA used RMP*Comp which calculates the volatilization rates and toxic endpoint distance.  The volatilization rate was based on 100F.  The EPA's RMP*Comp model indicates that the endpoint for this type of release is 1.2 miles. Based on this impact distance and the proximity of off-site receptors this is classified as a Program Level 3 release. \n\n\n\nB.    Propylene Oxide\n\n\n\nPropylene oxide is normally liquid at ambient temperature.  SESA assumed that the quantity in the largest storage vessel is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.

SESA assumed that the quantity of trichlorosilane that becomes vapor in the first 10 minutes is involved in the vapor cloud explosion.  SESA used RMP*Comp to estimate the distance to a 1-psi overpressurization endpoint.  The EPA's RMP*Comp model indicates that the endpoint for this type of release is 0.1 miles.

Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSESA actively encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and participation in the process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to the PHA and all other information required to be developed under the process safety management standard.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSESA maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations of the plant with regards "

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific personnel within SESA are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/-exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nSESA has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSESA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) an"

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSESA maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) startup after an emergency shutdown, (7) operating limits, and (8) safety and health considerations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, SESA has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the anhydrous ammonia process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, "

In addition, all operators receive refresher training at least once every three years on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nSESA uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, SESA evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nSESA conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems a"

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSESA has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) performing and documenting inspections and results, (2) conducting maintenance training, (3) developing written procedures, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  SESA incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repai"

The hot work permit and procedures are designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the hazardous area.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nSESA has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the facility processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nSESA promptly investigates all incidents that results in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

All personnel are trained in standard first aid and CPR training.  In the event of an emergency, plant personnel can contact the Brazoria County Fire Department.  \n\n Compliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, SESA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  SESA management will certify that the PSM has been evaluated at least every five (5) years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant personnel for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe production processes at SESA have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
