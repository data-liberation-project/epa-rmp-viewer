In 1989 under Title III, the Office of the County Judge, Cleburne County, Arkansas, ordered an \"Emergency Response\" and \"Hazardous Material Spill Emergency Plan\" be developed, and implemented.  The purpose of this plan was to develop a list of companies, businesses, factories and facilities that stored or maintained chemicals, fuels, gases or other substances that were identified as Hazardous.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Plan required a \"Response Procedure\" and was developed through the Cleburne County Committee formed under Title III.  The Committee addressed the following areas and detailed how each of the responsible agencies was to react.  These areas include but are not limited to the following:\n\n\n\n1. Communications\n\n2. Prompting Form\n\n3. Prompting Form Response Vehicles\n\n4. County Emergency Operations\n\n5. Emergency Equipment\n\n6. Health and Medical\n\n7. Health and Medical Resources\n\n8.

Direction, Control and Communications\n\n14. Emergency Public Information\n\n\n\nCommunity Water System PWA is a part of this countywide plan and was instrumental in its development as our facility uses and stores Chlorine Gas.  We use other chemicals, which have been identified as Non-Hazardous.  \n\n\n\nOn site safety for loading, unloading, handling and use of 150-pound cylinders of Chlorine has been addressed in our written plan for all location where they might be kept or stored.  Safety equipment availability, location and use are a part of our safety training.  \n\n\n\nSafety procedures have been developed using State and Federal guidelines.  The Board of Directors a"

      "SummaryText": "nd Management of Community Water System PWA have adopted a company policy for implementation of these guidelines. \n\n\n\nCommunity Water System PWA is a Water Treatment Facility located on the shore of Greers Ferry lake.  We provide water to both retail and wholesale customers.  Our retail system provides water to approximately 6,000 customers.  Our wholesale customer base is approximately 40,000.  Our existing Water Treatment Plant has capacity of 9.0 m.g.d and raw water is purchased from the Corp. of Engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Operation\n\n\n\nRaw water is drawn from the lake through four(4) separate intake structures and pumped up to the plant.  Three of the intake pipes have pumps that can deliver 2100 g.p.m each and the fourth intake can deliver 2900 g.p.m.  The pumps are redundant and no more than three pumps will normally be pumping at one time.\n\n\n\nThe water is pumped through a flow meter to record the amount of water taken from the lake.  Water samples are taken of this raw water to determine the amount of chemicals to be added, and flows from this point to a flash mixer.  At this point lime and polymer (PAC 950) are added based on previous water samples. The water is sampled again and then travels to the Claircone.  At this location anionic is added at the base of the Claircone and a small amount of chlorine used for algae control is also added near the top of the Claircone.  The process at the Claircone traps suspended particles in the water and settles them out.  The water then flows to a bank of twelve filters.  From the filters the water is Chlorinated and flows to a 1,000,000-gallon storage tank.  Water in this tank is piped to the High Service Building and then pumped from this building to either the retail or the wholesale transmission systems.  This pump system is also redundant.\n\n\n\nChemicals Used and Stored\n\n\n\nChlorine gas storage is in 150-lb. gas cylinders.  Under normal conditions a maximum of 16 full bottles will be on hand for a total capacity of 2"
