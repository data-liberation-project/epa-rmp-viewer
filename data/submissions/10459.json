The refinery employs 344 people in and around the Shreveport area.\nRegulated Substances\n     The Risk Management Program rule requires companies that use certain (threshold) quantities of toxic and flammable chemicals to develop scenarios that estimate the potential community impact from an accidental release. The following summarizes how these rules apply to the Pennzoil-Quaker State Company Shreveport Refinery:\nToxic Chemicals\n     The refinery does not have any Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated toxic chemicals over the reporting thresholds.  Hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas, is present in the refinery at quantities below the threshold.  Sulfur compounds, which may become hydrogen sulfide in the refining process, are a naturally occurring part of crude oil. \nFlammable Substances\n     The refinery has five flammables above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. These are:\n*  Propane                   *    Butane                      *   Isobutane\n*  Pentane                   *    Propylene\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n    Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has designated a Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP) Coordinator with the necessary background, training, and experience.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP elements and the elements of Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) PSM program (where applicable) as required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's Safe Operating Committee (SOC).

We have not had a release of any RMP regulated substance that caused an injury in the refinery or has gone off site in the past five years.  We investigate all releases as part of our ongoing accident prevention program.  \nEmergency Response Program\n     Pennzoil-Quaker State Company Shreveport Refinery has an Integrated Emergency Response Plan. This means that we work with internal and external groups in responding to emergencies.  Our 65 fire brigade members volunteer to serve the refinery and surrounding community in fire prevention and suppression.  They receive training at Shreveport Fire Academy with the Shreveport Fire Department, Louisiana State University, Texas A & M, and the Northeast Texas Fire School. The Shreveport Fire Department comes in the refinery several times a year to tour the operating units, participate in emergency drill exercises and preplan emergency operations. \n     Our emergency re"

We have 24-hour communications capability with those organizations.  In addition, we subscribe to the First Call Network for quickly notifying our community with any necessary emergency information. \nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nWorse Case Scenario\n     A worst case scenario is defined by EPA, as the rapid and complete release of the largest container of the chemical under conditions that would maximize its potential impact.  It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems requiring energy or human intervention are operational.  The EPA definition requires us to develop a scenario that is actually a series of highly unlikely events, each one reaching its end point before it is followed by the next unlikely event, until the worst case scenario results.  A worst case scenario is extremely unlikely to occur.\n    Under this definition, catastrophic failure of our largest storage tank of liquefied petroleum gas would be our Worst Case Release of a regulated flammable substance.  Our largest affected tank is a butane sphere tank that can contain up to 2,081,235 pounds of butane.  In the scenario, the tank fails and releases the entire contents in a 10-minute period and then ignites.  We estimate, using EPA guidelines and certain weather conditions, that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could have a pressure wave of over 1 pound per square inch for a distance of about one mile. We believe that an event of this type is extremely unlikely because of the preventive controls that are in place and the very low probability that a catastrophic release of the entire tank's contents could occur.\nAlternate Release Scenario (A More Realistic Scenario)\n     EPA also requires that an alternate release scenario be prepared giving a more realistic scenario.  The scenario can take into account prev"

      "SummaryText": "ention and response schemes at the facility, but must still have a potential for off-site impact.  We selected a loading line failure during a butane truck delivery for the required alternate release scenario. In this scenario, the truck begins the unloading process into the refinery butane storage tank when the loading line ruptures completely.  Should there be a release from the truck loading line, the loading rack check valves stop the flow of butane from plant storage.  The truck could continue to offload until it is manually shut off at the truck valve. Liquid butane would continue to flow from the truck at a rate of about 1,000 pounds per minute and may form a butane cloud.  We feel confident that we could shut the truck down within five minutes using permanent mitigation equipment in the loading area, resulting in a cloud of about 5,000 pounds.  Should the butane ignite and explode or burn we estimate a pressure wave of over one pound per square inch would go about 317 feet using EPA calculation methods. \n      Mitigation equipment in the area consists of firewater monitors, hydrocarbon alarms, and multiple shut down stations in the loading area capable of shutting in the entire loading dock system.  Drivers are required to watch trucks loading or unloading at all times and our trained emergency response personnel would immediately respond to the incident. Further, we inspect loading lines regularly to detect wear or damage and replace them as needed to preclude releases such as those described here.   \n      In the event of a release, we would activate our Emergency Operating Procedure and notify local agencies and emergency responders.  Our Emergency Operation Center would notify our neighbors to shelter in place or evacuate through the First Call Network. \nRecent Safety Improvements  \nThe following is a list of key improvements the facility has or is committed to implementing:\n      In 1998, we installed a new 3,000-gpm Diesel firewater pump and 25,000-bbl"
