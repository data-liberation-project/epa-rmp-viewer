These improvements have included more awareness of chemical hazards, system upgrades, and staffing additions. \n\nFacility And Regulated Substance Handling \n\nCountry Fresh, LLC is a producer of dairy products which includes the processing, packaging and delivery of milk, cottage cheese, bottled water, and various types of dips.  We also produce bagged ice. The facility also has a very large freezer and several coolers used as central storage and distribution point for ice cream and yogurt.  The entire facility is located within a seventeen acre site which is comprised of manufacturing, Distribution, Garage, and offices. \n\nDue to the type of products we produce and store, refrigeration and temperature control are critical.  To accomplish and maintain temperature control the facility uses anhydrous ammonia within the refrigeration system.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical \u00bf Specific Prevention\n\nCountry Fresh, LLC complies with State of Michigan MIOSHA regulations which include Process Safety Management (PSM).  Additionally the facility complies with federal EPA requirements and State of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) standards.\n\nOur program of chemical safety includes:\n\n- Technological improvements \u00bf upgrading of the ammonia system,\n- Management systems which results in improved maintenance using\n  Preventative Maintenance, and\n- Upgrading of procedures and training programs.\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\nIn the last five years, Country Fresh, LLC has had no accidental releases meeting the reporting criteria.  \n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nOur emergency response program includes coordination of efforts through the Kent County LEPC and Wyoming Fire Department.

The facility also works closely with the local fire department regarding proper chemical release notifications and coordination between all parties.  In the event of an emergency, public notification would be through the local fire department.\n\nChanges For Improved Safety\n\nOur programs have and will continue to improve.   In early 2003 we acquired a full time degreed Environmental, Health & Safety Manager.  This individual has strengthened our written policies and procedures and coordination with outside response agencies.  Additionally, in 2003 we acquired an engineer with full-time responsibility for upgrading and maintaining our Process Safety Management Program."
