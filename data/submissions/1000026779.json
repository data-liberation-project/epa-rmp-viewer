The Transloading System and Ancillary Storage Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 (2004 Edition).\r\n\r\nThis existing Transloading System and Ancillary Storage Facility (initiated in 2005) has never had an accident/incident since the onset of operations which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Upper Deerfield Township Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility response plans are coordinated with the fire department, the Upper Deerfield Township Office of Emergency Management and Cumberland County Department of Public Safety. Upper Deerfield Township Fire Department, EMS and Vineland City Haz Mat have participated in training exercises at this facility.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), railcar pressure reliefs, line pressure reliefs, and grounding/interlock (truck) devices. Additional vessel protection includes remote fire monitors. Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nInergy Propane LLC dba Inergy Services - South Jersey Terminal looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements and will continue coordination to integrate procedures for the LPG Transloading System  and  Ancillary Storage facility.

It is the intent of South Jersey Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA #58-2011) into this process. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify Upper Deerfield Township Fire Department as well as the Upper Deerfield Twp.

Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services (Upper Deerfield Township EMS) and Bridgeton Health Center. The closest Level I Trauma Center is Cooper University Hospital in Camden.\r\n\r\nInergy Propane LLC dba Inergy Services - South Jersey Terminal LPG Transloading System and Ancillary Storage Facility provides for the transfer of liquefied butane (normal, iso, and mixed), propane, propylene, and  propane - propylene mix. (hereafter referred to as LPG) under pressure from stationary (detached from locomotive) pressure tank/rail cars. The LPG is transferred to storage vessels via transloading towers. In addition, liquid transfers can occur directly from the railcars via transloading towers to transport vehicles without prior transfer to a storage cylinder.  The stored liquefied gases are loaded to transport vehicles from the storage cylinders via loading stations. Liquid transfer is also available via unloading stations for transport vehicles to offload primarily in the case of over loading. For modeling purposes, the flammable mixture was modeled as butane, the component of single greatest consequence.\r\n\r\nInergy Propane LLC dba Inergy Services - South Jersey Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Pre"
