(hereafter referred to as LPG) under pressure from stationary (detached from locomotive) pressure tank/rail cars (maximum inventory of ten [10] units, at approximately 31,000 gallons of LPG per unit [33,600 gallons of water capacity]. The LPG is transferred to storage vessels consisting of three (3) 60,000 gallon LPG storage cylinders and two (2) 30,000 LPG storage cylinders via four[4] transloading towers. In addition, liquid transfers can occur directly from the railcars via one (1) of five [5] total transloading towers to transport vehicles without prior transfer to a storage cylinder.  The stored liquefied gases are loaded to transport vehicles from the storage cylinders via four (4) loading stations. Liquid transfer is also available via three (3) unloading stations for transport vehicles to offload primarily in the case of over loading.",
