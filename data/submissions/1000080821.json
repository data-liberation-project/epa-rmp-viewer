The Facility process and packages seafood products. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at the Facility. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSilver Bay has developed a California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program in general accordance with the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, and Federal EPA requirements, 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP), and federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119 and California OSHA 8 CCR 5189 to enhance existing anhydrous ammonia safety and emergency response programs. The Facility was purchased and renovated by Silver Bay in 2019. Silver Bay is committed to worker and public safety through investment in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Silver Bay's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Silver Bay will notify and rely on support services provided by the local fire department and the emergency response agencies in the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the Facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\nSilver Bay has a anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Facility for processing and cooling seafood. Most of the ammonia refrigeration system equipment and piping is located outside, with the exception of the blast cells, ice makers and plate freezers. Silver Bay modified the existing two-stage refrigeration system to meet its cooling needs. Upgrades to the system were included in the process modification of the refrigeration system and included installing"

The liquid ammonia coil cools the low stage booster compressor (SC02) discharge gas before it is introduced to the high stage suction (HTS).  The high pressure, sub-cooled ammonia liquid (HPSCL) leaves the intercooler vessel and is used to supply low temperature liquid ammonia to the low pressure recirculator vessel (RP01) and the ice maker IM01 & IM02 surge drums.  The recirculator vessel pumps low temperature liquid ammonia to the plate freezers and the blast cooler coils.  The liquid ammonia in the ice maker surge drums supplies a constant level to feed to ice maker's cooling jackets as it absorbs heat from the water flowing through the inner barrel jacket and builds ice on the side walls to be scrapped off and collected for use. The liquid ammonia turns to a gas as it absorbs heat and the ammonia vapor produced is drawn away by the booster compressors as needed to maintain suction pressure.  Any liquid ammonia that may be drawn out of the ice makers will return to the surge drum vessel.  The liquid ammonia in the plate freezers absorbs heat from the water flowing through the inner plates and absorbs heat from the product. The liquid ammonia turns to a gas as it absorbs heat and the ammonia vapor produced is drawn away by the booster compresso"

The liquid ammonia in the air handling blast cell coils absorbs heat from the air flowing through the inner coils.  The liquid ammonia turns to a gas as it absorbs heat and the ammonia vapor produced is drawn away by the booster compressor as needed to maintain suction pressure at 11.7\" Hg. Any liquid ammonia that may be drawn out of the evaporators will return to the recirculator (accumulator) vessel. The booster compressor (SC02) compress the low-pressure ammonia vapor drawn away from the cooling equipment, raising the pressure and temperature.  This superheated compressed vapor is then sent to the intercooler where it will be cooled to a lower temperature vapor before entering the high stage compressor (SC01). The high stage compressor compresses the medium pressure ammonia vapor drawn away from the intercooler, raising the pressure and temperature in order to maintain a high stage suction pressure.  The compressed ammonia vapor containing the heat is sent to the evaporative condenser (EC01) be dissipated to atmosphere through the condenser. The ammonia gas condenses back to a liquid in the condenser as it cools and then gravity flows back into the high pressure (HPR) receiver for re-use by the system.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP RMP, key prevention program elements were implemented by Silver Bay to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for refrigeration. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being followed. The CalARP/RMP/PSM prevention program elements include the following:\n\n&#159;    Management System\n\n&#159;    Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n&#159;    Five Year Accident History\n\n&#159;    Process Safety Info"

Facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the Facility. An alternative release scenario must be evaluated for each covered process. This Facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios. These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA but are presented in the CalARP/RMP.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the Silver Bay Facility in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nSilver Bay is a non-responding facility and relies on support services provided by the local fire department and emergency response team in the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the Facility. As part of the implementation of this CalARP/RMP/PSM Program, an Emergency Action Plan was created for Silver Bay; employees will evacuate in the event of an uncontrolled ammonia release.

Silver Bay will address PHA recommendations within the 2 ?-year time frame set forth in the January 1, 2015, CalARP requirements.\n\n\n\nManagement responses and actions will be consistent with Silver Bay's commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operation. Silver Bay recognizes that the CalARP/RMP/PSM program is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its Facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Silver Bay continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Silver Bay will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the CalARP/RMP/PSM program, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Silver Bay's practices, and Silver Bay will maintain the most current version onsite. Thus, the most current version of the CalARP/RMP/PSM program and related documents and elements maintained onsite may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to regulatory agencies.\n\n"
