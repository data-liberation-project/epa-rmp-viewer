An audit performed in 2005 recommended changes to the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) that was prepared for the Facility for prior RMP submittals that placed the Facility into Program 3 of the RMP program.  Because the chlorine system is being replaced by 2008, and the Facility in fact has always qualified as a Program 2 facility, the RMP is being resubmitted as Program 2 which does not require a PHA.  This change does not alter the underlying proactive safety and environmental philosophy of the Facility.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe City of Westminster (the City) believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, the City has developed proactive safety and environmental programs which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Facility RMP for the chlorine system.  \n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the conseq"

      "SummaryText": "uences of a release should one occur.\n\nThe City takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the chlorine management and processes, and chlorine system maintenance.  The employees who work with the chlorine system are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nThe City management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Facility RMP manual.\n\nAs for emergency response, the City has established and maintained procedures for emegency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and reviewed to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nThe Facility is located at 13150 N. Huron Street, Westminster, Adams County, Colorado.  The Facility treats the wastewater for the northern portion of Westminster and is an activated sludge plant designated by the State of Colorado as a Class A plant.  The Facility received an award from the EPA for the best plant operating in Region VIII in 1986 and 1992.\n\nThe Facility currently uses chlorine as a biocide to treat the water prior to discharge to Big Dry Creek.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of six containers (12,000 pounds) on site.  Due to the volume of chlorine stored and used, the Facility is regulated under the RMP rule.\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the RMP Manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n- Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process techno"

If the chlorine sensor detects a specified level, audio and visual alarms will be activated.  The alarm system is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation should there be a chlorine release.\n\nAccident history:  Within the five-year period prior to this submittal, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The Facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the Westminster Fire Department.  The program is described in the RMP Manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which includes facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes:  In September 2005, the City embarked on a capital program to fully replace the current chlorination system with an ultraviolet treatment system, thereby eliminating chlorine from the site.  The UV system"

Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly to encourage and train the employees to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nSeveral changes have been made to the facility since the original RMP was developed in 1999 to improve safety and to accommodate the new \"Reclaim Plant.\"  The changes completed in 2000 included raising the level of the chlorine tanks and adding new scales in the storage room; adding a second tethered air system; hanging valves from the ceiling and adding automatic shut-off systems that activate upon leak detection; adding chlorine lines from the existing facility to the new Reclaim Plant under Big Dry Creek; and adding two new chlorine feeders.  The RMP has been modified to reflect the changes."
