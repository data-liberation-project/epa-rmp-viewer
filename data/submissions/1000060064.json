CUSA is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it operates.  That commitment is documented in the vision and values outlined in CUSA Corporate Policy, The Chevron Way - Getting Results the Right Way. CUSA's vision is to be the global energy company most admired for its people, partnership and performance. The Chevron Way value of Protecting People and the Environment places the highest priority on the health and safety of the workforce (employees and contractors) and protection of the environment and assets.  CUSA policies, procedures and guidelines can be accessed by all employees on the company intranet.\r\n\r\nTo achieve and sustain its Vision CUSA has developed Tenets of Operation, a tool used by the workforce to guide daily decisions.

Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\nThe prevention programs described in the following section represent integrated, administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. All covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressure, flow, level) within allowable limits. The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed allowable limits.

Process Safety Information\r\nPSI is vital to the safe operation of the Refinery. Personnel use PSI regarding chemical hazards, equipment specifications, and operating limits in daily operation and strategic decision making.\r\n \r\nThe Refinery's Process Safety Information (PSI) program satisfies the requirements of Section 2760.1 of the Cal/ARP regulations.\r\n\r\nPSI is compiled during the design and construction of each process. Equipment in the process is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  PSI is updated as needed when any changes or additions are made and it is retained for the life of the process or equipment plus 30 years, consistent with the Refinery's record retention requirements for PHA files.\r\n\r\nEstablished procedures, documented in Refinery Instruction RI-362 Process Safety Information, guide employees on how to keep PSI up to date, accurate, and  readily available to employees. PSI is kept current by following established management of change (MOC) process. Electronic files of most PSI are maintained on the Refinery Information Server. Locations of electronic and hard copies of all PSI are specified in RI-362. Personnel have access to either the hard copies or electronic copies on a 24-hour basis.  This gives personnel involved in operating the process the ability to identify and understand the hazards posed by each process. The following PSI is important to the prevention program.\r\n\r\nInformation pertaining to the materials in the process:\r\n- Safety data sheets (SDS) are maintained for each regulated substance and include the following information: toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity and chemical compatibility data, corrosivity data, and thermal and chemical stability data\r\n- Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials"

Mechanical Integrity\r\nThe Refinery has developed a mechanical integrity program that satisfies the requirements of Section 2760.5 of the Cal/ARP regulation. Proper design and maintenance of equipment and safety systems is essential to prevent releases of hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical integrity program applies to fixed and rotating equipment, instrumentation, and electrical systems. This includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems (including piping components such as valves), compressors, pumps, pressure relief devices, and vent systems, all of which are inspected following API guidelines.

Copies of the procedures and checklists used are available through the Refinery Information Server and/or hard copies may be retained in the Maintenance Supervisor's office. The regularly scheduled maintenance (preventative maintenance) requests are automatically generated by a computer-based maintenance work management system.
