Each compressor station receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transports the gas to a processing plant.  Control of the dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons).  The amount of moisture in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the well heads.  The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\n\nAs gas flows through the pipeline, its temperature will decrease to about the same temperature as the surrounding environment.  If this temperature is below the dew point of the gas, the water and heavy hydrocarbons will tend to condense.  The resulting buildup of hydrates can begin to restrict gas flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe.  In extreme cold, the hydrates may even form a potentially dangerous ice plug.\n\nIn order to reduce the dew point of the gas (minimize the formation of hydrates), the inlet gas is put through a slug catcher, an inlet separator, and a glycol contactor with scrubber to remove moisture.  Compression of the gas causes some of the naturally occurring hydrocarbons, which are in the vapor phase of the inlet gas stream, to condense out of the stream.  This allows heavy hydrocarbons and water to condense out of the gas resulting in a lower dew point.  These condensed raw natural gas liquids (NGL), also called condensate, are stored in tanks until there is a sufficient volume to be pumped into a tank truck for transportation for processing into marketable products.  The glycol is regenerated and used again.\n\nThe Liquid Recovery Plant takes high-pressure gas from HS Gathering's Platteville Compressor Station and removes gross liqu"

These liquids along with those from the slug catcher and inlet separators flow through a Deethanizer in which ethane is removed and recycled back to the plant residue stream.  The NGL then flow to three 57,000 gallon NGL storage tanks.  The NGL is pumped via pipeline to market.\n\nThe flammability and volume of the raw NGL stored at The Fort Lupton Plant triggered coverage under the EPA RMP Standard.\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Fort Lupton Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the early 1970's.  HS Resources entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy, in December of 1999.  KN Energy operated the system from April 1993 through December 1, 1999.\n\nProgram Level\n\nHS Gathering has determined that Program Level 3 applies to the Fort Lupton Plant since it is under OSHS's PSM Standard and less than 0.3 miles from the condensate tanks to NARCO's Plant across the road.  The Fort Lupton Plant has a documented Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated with the local Fire Department and has had no accidental release of the regulated substance (condensate) that directly or indirectly caused a death, injury, or response or restoration activity for an environmental receptor in the previous five years.\n\nOffsite consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with flammable substances stored at the Fort Lupton Compressor Station is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a catastrophic tank failure in the condensate tank storage area.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 80% of the maximum tank capacity.  Therefore the reduced inventory is assumed, resulting in a release of 250,000 lbs. (approximately 46,000 gals.) of condensate over a 10-minute period.  Although we have various controls to prevent such releases and to manage t"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the HS Gathering Fort Lupton Compressor Station and Liquid Recovery Plant, (here in referred to as Fort Lupton Plant).\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\nHS Gathering LLC has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, HS Gathering personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, HS Gathering will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies.\n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\nHS Gathering's Fort Lupton Plant is located in Weld County, Colorado about three (3) miles east of Highway 85 on WCR 22 in a rural area which is used primarily for farming.  NARCO's Gas Plant is across the road.\n\nThe Fort Lupton Plant is made up of two compression systems and a liquid recovery plant.  The station separates liquid condensate from the inlet gas prior to compression and collects them in five 225-barrel product storage tanks.\n\nThe high-pressure system, units #31, #32, #34 and #35, compress the incoming gas to approximately 1,200 psig at a throughput of 25 MMCFD.  The gas is dehydrated with ethylene glycol and discharged from the station through 12 and 20 cleanable pipelines.\n\nThe low-pressure system, units #33, #36 and #37, compress the gas to approximately 280 psig at a throughput of 150 MMCFD.  Gas is discharged through a 24 cleanable pipeline to the Hudson Compressor Station for recompression.\n\nThe Liquid Recovery Plant removes natural gas liquids (NGL) from the Platteville high-pressure (1,200 psig) gas, removes the e"
