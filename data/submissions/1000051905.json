The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals.
