The carbon dioxide is purified, compressed and refrigerated into liquid form and the carbon dioxide is stored under pressure as a refrigerated liquid.  The facility also manufactures and processes various forms of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice).  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in two independent and separate Ammonia refrigeration systems located in the facility.  Each system has an ammonia receiver that stores the ammonia refrigerant in addition to various heat exchangers, compressors and connecting piping and valves.\n\n      Our worst case scenario for the ammonia system is a failure of both ammonia receivers resulting in the release of ammonia.  The quantity of the release is estimated to be 15,000 lb of ammonia over a 10 minute period of time with the most stable atmospheric conditions which minimizes dispersion of a release and thus the worst case of quantity released and worst case due to atmospheric conditions.  The calculated toxic endpoint of which the  concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 1.5 miles.  These calculations are based on the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"  Public receptors identified within the 1.5 miles of the facility include residences, schools, hospitals, recreational facilities, and commercial/industrial areas.\n\n      An alternate release scenario was also calculated using EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\" A leak from a pipe or vessel was assumed to create a release of 133 lb per minute.  The atmospheric conditions are assumed more typical of the area and the calculated toxic endpoint of which the ammonia concentration is said not to exceed 200 ppm. Is 530 ft. (0.1 miles).  Again calculations were based on  EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"  Public receptors within the 0.1 miles of the facility in"

In addition, this facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulations.  Our comprehensive prevention program includes documented process safety information to ensure safe and reliable plant operation, process hazard analysis to identify and train all effected employees in the hazards associated with the operation of an ammonia refrigeration system, mehanical integrity procedures to ensure adequate and proper plant maintenance.  Should an accident or near miss occur, procedures are in place to thoroughly investigate the incident and take corrective action as necessary.  We believe the key to preventing incidents is continuously improving our operating and prevention procedures and better educating our employees.\n\n      This is a new facility with all refrigeration components being made within ASME and ASHRAE specifications.  The system is also to be thoroughly inspected and tested prior to starting the system.\n\n      In the event of an ammonia release, the plant has developed an emergency reponse plan and procedure.  If necessary, the Loudon Fire Department will be contacted and emergency response procedures will be coordinated with the Loudon Fire Department.  The Fire department has inspected our facility and we will continue to work with the fire department, the Loudon County LEPC and any other local authorities in order to most effectively protect our employees, our property, and the community.\n\n      The facility is committed to the continued safety of its employees and the community by adhering with all applicable federal, state and local laws.  We believe that safety is a moving target and we must always be improving our operating procedures and practices in order to improve the health and safety in "
