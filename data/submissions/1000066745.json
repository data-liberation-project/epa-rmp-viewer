      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe AmeriGas Spokane terminal is propane storage and distribution facility. The facility includes four\n\n(4) above-ground storage tanks which each have a 30,000 gallon capacity. It also has two (2)\n\nCompressors used to unload the rails cars. The terminal has a siding with one (1) rail towers designed\n\nto hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of Compressors.\n\nCompressors withdraw propane vapors from the storage tank and compress them or increase their\n\npressure and discharge into the rail cars to be unloaded. This process slightly decreases the\n\npressure in the bulk storage tanks and increases the pressure in the rail cars. As a result, liquid\n\npropane flows from rail car to the bulk storage tanks.\n\n\n\nThe terminal has one (1) Liquid Pumps. There are two bulkheads with no meters. One bulkhead with\n\nmeter which is the main one used to load transports. Liquid propane is loaded to transports using\n\nliquid pumps.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain\n\nsafety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our\n\noperations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as\n\nto minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere\n\nto all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Logistics Managers\n\nand a Terminal Operations Supervisor who are able to immediately respond to a serious incident\n\nand provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the\n\nincident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC),\n\nwhich handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. The ECC has the ability\n\nto contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any typ"

      "SummaryText": "e of incident encountered at\n\nany AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario that was considered was catastrophic release of propane from a 30, 000\n\nGallons Tank. Using EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi over pressure end\n\npoint for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles\n\n\n\nRMP Comp was used as a tool to calculate distance to endpoints of 1 psi over pressure. RMP Comp\n\nassumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability class F\n\n(stable atmosphere) and wind speed 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). Ambient air\n\ntemperature assumed is 25 C (77 F).\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nFor alternative release scenario,\n\n release from transfer hoses at the facility was considered. The\n\nactive mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of\n\nthe hose. Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated\n\ndistance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles\n\n"
