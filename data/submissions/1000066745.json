The propane was assumed to disperse in the flammable range, encounter areas of sufficient congestion and confinement, and result in a vapor cloud explosion.\nUsing EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst-case distance to 1 psi overpressure endpoint for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles.\n\nAssumption\nRMP assumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). The ambient air temperature assumed is 25 deg C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nAn alternative release scenario is the scenario most likely to happen. At the Spokane terminal, only portions of piping are exposed. A hose rupture by pull away was considered as an alternative case scenario. The total quantity of propane released was calculated as approximately 20 lbs.  The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. Using the equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure endpoint for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\nBroken or burst propane loading hoses were determined to be the most common failure. Pumps and Compressors were also considered. Maintenance and mitigation devices are in place that would mitigate the risks of release from pumps and compressors. Vessel overfilling is mitigated administratively. The storage tanks are filled only to a maximum of 85% of the total capacity to allow expansion of the product."

AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager, and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel as well as Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at an AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA\u2019s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals. In addition, the site complies with EPA\u2019s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. \n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained in the terminal\u2019s loading and Emergency Action Plan procedures and many have also been trained using the National Propane Gas Association\u2019s (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst-case scenario. Worst case scenario is analyzed by estimating the distance to an overpressure endpoint of 1 psi resulting from the vapor cloud explosion of a cloud containing the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process pipe failure.

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Spokane Terminal consists of west side and east side. The AmeriGas Spokane terminal is propane storage and distribution facility. The facility includes four (4) above-ground storage tanks which each have a 30,000 gallon capacity. It also has two (2) Compressors used to unload the rail cars and one (1) Liquid Pump. There are two (2) bulkheads with no meters and one (1) bulkhead with a meter which is in the main one used to load transports.\n\nThe terminal has a siding with one (1) rail tower designed to hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of compressors. Compressors withdraw propane vapors from the storage tank and compress them or increase their pressure and discharges into the rail car to be unloaded. This process slightly decreases the pressure in the bulk storage tanks and increases the pressure in the rail cars. As a result, liquid propane flows from rail car to the bulk storage tanks. Liquid propane is loaded to transports using liquid pumps.\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThough the site is classified as a non-responding facility, it maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), complying with state of Wyoming regulations. Both plans include procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement, and medical organizations. Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. Should an actual incident occur, the plans five guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\n\nThe EAP is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on-site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise.
