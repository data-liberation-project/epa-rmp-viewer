Corporate and local plant management and personnel are committed to delivering excellence in the safety, health and environmental (SHE) aspects of plant operations.  In order to achieve excellent SHE performance, a comprehensive SHE management program has been deployed.  This program is outlined below.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nExxonMobil has implemented a SHE management framework via its Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS).  OIMS requires a \u00bfmanagement systems\u00bf approach to all aspects of SHE performance.  These management systems are designed to ensure that policies/processes/procedures are defined, roles and responsibilities are clarified, performance is measured, and continuous improvement is driven.  \n\nThe Houston Olefins Plant has implemented management systems in the following 20 key SHE performance areas:\n? Management Leadership, Commitment and Accountability\n? Risk Analysis, Assessment and Management\n? Facilities Design and Construction\n? Process and Facilities Information/Documentation\n? Personnel Safety\n? Health\n? Personnel\n? Training\n? Operations and Maintenance Procedures\n? Work Permits\n? Inspection and Maintenance\n?

These chemicals are used as feedstocks for plastics, synthetic fabrics and fuels.\n\nThe Houston Olefins Plant contains the following regulated flammable substances"

An overview of these efforts, grouped into the 20 key SHE management system areas, is provided here.  These activities are designed to ensure compliance with 40 CFR Part 68, 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA PSM) and American Chemistry Council Responsible Care requirements.\n\nManagement Leadership, Commitment and Accountability\n? Sets requirements for members of site management to participate/lead SHE efforts\n? Sets SHE expectations for site personnel\n? Requires that SHE goals are set and stewarded on a periodic basis\n\nRisk Analysis, Assessment and Management\n? Ensures that plant processes are reviewed for hazards using PHA/HAZOP and other risk analysis/assessment techniques\n? Requires that the appropriate risk reduction activities are completed as planned\n\nFacilities Design and Construction\n? Sets up processes and procedures to ensure new facilities are designed and constructed to appropriate standards\n\nProcess and Facilities Information/Documentation\n? Sets up processes to manage the various types of \u00bfprocess safety information\u00bf (plant documentation) required to operate the plant\n\nPersonnel Safety\n? Sets up programs to improve personnel safety performance by helping workers recognize and remove/manage hazards in the workplace\n\nHealth\n?
