These facilities utilize up to 12 cylinders in-service at a time, and 6 cylinders are stocked on-site in preparation for empty cylinder exchanges.  Typically 4 to 8 cylinders are exchanged in a week.  The stock cylinders are provided with safety bonnets that protect fragile valve components on the cylinders from damage during transit and when the cylinders are not in-service.  The bonnets are only removed immediately prior to placing a cylinder in-service.\n\n\n\nThe rooms in which the cylinders are stored (i.e, \"Scale Rooms\") are maintained at a temperature of around 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  An emergency eyewash, shower, and emergency equipment kit are provided in each Scale Room.  The facilities are equipped with a chlorine gas monitor that is connected to an alarm that would notify City personnel in the occurrence of a chlorine release.  Blueprints of the facilities, MSDS sheets, and a first-aid kits are also provided on-site at each facility. \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency responsibilities have been instituted at each facility which include, but are not limited to, the following programs and procedures:  standard operating and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine, notification of trained personnel, and emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the occurrence that local emergency response is required.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program that is in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporate operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems, and alarms.\n\n\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred in the last 5 years.  Procedures are in place to identify and record any future accidents or incidents.\n\n\n\nAn"
