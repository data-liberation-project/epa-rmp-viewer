Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility involves the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia would be approximately one-18,000 and one-12,000 gallon storage tanks; and approximately 184,900 pounds available capacity in various 1,450,and 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections. Visual checks are to be conducted daily at the facility.\n\n\n\n4.
