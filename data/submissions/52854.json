      "SummaryText": "September 19, 2008\n\n\n?68.155(a) Policies\n\nAt Kinder Morgan Operating LP ?C?, a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Bulk Terminals (Kinder Morgan), we handle substances considered hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.  Currently, the facility stores Anhydrous Ammonia above threshold quantities and is therefore subject to EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management (RMP) regulations and also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Admistration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program 3 requirements.\n\nKinder Morgan Bulk Terminals is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local, state, and federal emergency responders to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nAt the facility, there are two (2) storage tanks, designated as T-101 and T-102, which are dedicated to anhydrous ammonia service.  Each tank has a rated nominal storage capacity of 45,000,000 pounds of product.  The a"

Both tanks are held in containment to reduce the environmental and health impacts during a release event.\n\n?68.155? Accidental Release Prevention Program, and Specific Prevention Steps \n\nKinder Morgan complies with the OSHA PSM rules, EPA?s RMP rules and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nKinder Morgan maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the process information can be found in our PSM program documents.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nIt is Kinder Morgan?s policy to prevent accidental releases from the terminal by effective PSM programs and procedures.  Kinder Morgan requires participation by terminal employees in every element of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and PSM programs.\n\nOur personnel conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five (5) years. Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.  PHA?s and PHA revalidations are retained for the life of the process.  PHA information is retained in our PSM program documents.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our process, Kinder Morgan maintains written operation procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, no"

These procedures can be found in our PSM program documents.  \n\nTraining\n\nKinder Morgan has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the process. Kinder Morgan training program is fully described in our PSM program documents.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Inspection procedures and records can be found in our PSM program documents.  \n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of provided training as required to deal with the modification.  Management of change procedures and records can be found in our PSM program documents.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Kinder Morgan.  The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup of unloading/loading/storage prior to placing equipment into operations.  Pre-startup safety review procedures and records can be found in our PSM program "

These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  Copies of our two (2) most recent compliance audits are retained for review.  \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nKinder Morgan promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Our accident investigation program is detailed in Kinder Morgan?s Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) program documents.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Kinder Morgan promotes employee participation in every element of the PSM program.  Employee participation is documented on our PSM program.  \n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, Kinder Morgan hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities.  We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the process.  Contractors are informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release occur.  It is our policy to oversee the activities of contractors and ensure that they are trained to perform their jobs safely.  Contractors are required to be evaluated and approved before starting any work on the PSM covered process.  \n\n?68.155(d) Five-year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five (5) years.
