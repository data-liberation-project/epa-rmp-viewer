Wawona Packing Company LLC Main Facility at 12133 Ave. 408 Ave in Cutler California has 2 independent refrigeration systems with anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. This is Update is to note changes of combining West and South process. This eliminates one mechancial room and associated high side refrigeration equipment. Applicable sections were updated. No change in worst case or alternate case changes.\r\n\r\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \r\n\r\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Wawona Packing Company LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of tree fruit.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system. Only one of the systems has an estimated inventory more than 10,000 lbs., and two are slightly less than 10,000 lbs.. We have developed and implemented a program level 3 based on anhydrous ammonia > 10,000 lbs. at the facility for all processes. \r\n\r\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to l"

In the previous filing a \"safe\" capacity had been selected. The was no increase in the largest vessel.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote \"dialogue\". According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  To perform the required offsite consequence analyses for other substances we have used.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking.\r\n\r\nAlternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. It was revised to reflect the recent reportable release scenario. There was no change in the distance to toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Mechanical Code. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nWawona Packing Company LLC maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\r\n\r\nProce"
