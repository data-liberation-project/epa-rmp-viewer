      "SummaryText": "At the Kanawha Valley Water Treatment (KVWTP) facility, West Virginia American Water (WVAW) handles chlorine above the threshold limits for the purpose of disinfecting and treating drinking water.  EPA considers chlorine as a hazardous chemical.  The hazards of this chemical make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is WVAW policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which chlorine is handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency action plan is based upon OSHA 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans) and experience obtained from community emergency response drills.  The facility's emergency response plan is reviewed annually and audited once per 3 years.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan must be updated and resubmitted every 5 years and within 30 days of any change that requires changing the process hazard analysis, the Offsite Consequence Analysis, or the EPA RMP Prevention Program. If a new regulated chemical is introduced above a threshold quantity, a revised submittal is required no later than the date the chemical is first present. If the inventory of chemicals drops below the EPA RMP thresholds, a revised RMP registration indicating the change must be submitted within 6 months.\r\n\r\nThe West Virginia American Water (WVAW) Kanawha Valley Water Treatment Plant (KVWTP) has developed a Risk management Plan (RMP) as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as defined in 40 CFR 68.10.   The overall responsibility for the compliance of the KVWTP's RMP is overseen by the Chief Operator.  The assigned Operational Risk Management personnel for West Virginia"

      "SummaryText": "American Water will also provide support for the elements of the program.  Additional West Virginia American Water personnel will be assigned to assist in the compliance of the program as needed by the Plant Supervisor and the Chief Operator.\r\n\r\nThe Kanawha Valley Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment facility that has a design capacity of 60.0 MGD. It takes raw river water from the Elk River in Charleston, West Virginia, and treats the river water with chlorine and other chemicals to make potable (drinking) quality water for public distribution and consumption.  Sewage treatment is not a part of plant operations. The plant handles one RMP-regulated toxic substance above the EPA threshold quantity, which is chlorine. No regulated flammable substances are present at the treatment plant. \r\n\r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered to our plant and stored in 1-ton (\"ton\") cylinders and liquid chlorine is fed to the process from two of the ton containers at a time. The container storage room can hold up to 26 one-ton (52,000 lbs) cylinders. Two containers are connected to the same feed piping manifold at a time. An alternate supply arrangement consists of two additional ton containers connected to 2 separate pigtails, but normally isolated, feed a common piping manifold. Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure, fed as a liquid to chlorine evaporators, and injected as a vapor at the outlet of the chlorinators into the water stream. The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program."
