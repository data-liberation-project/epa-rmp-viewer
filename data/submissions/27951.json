If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Denton fire department, and Doniphan County LEPC to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to poeple and the environment.\nThe primary function at this facility is the storage of agricultural fertilizers for sale to area producers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed as a fertilzier for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored at this location is 192,610 pounds in one 30,000 gallon storage vessel and 14 nurse tanks.\nThe worst-case release scenario using Degadis modeling is the release of our largest tanks contents over a ten minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank filled to 85% capacity as limited by safety and design standards.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles using the rural classification.  The alternative release scenario based on a five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is.83 miles.\nTo prevent accidental releases our company is complying with the Kansas Department of Agriculture rules and regulations.\nThere has not been any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\nOur facility has a written emergency response plan included with our RMP Compliance Manual.  We have also reported our anhydrous ammonia to the Kansas Department of Heath & Enviroment Right-to-Know program as required.  Additionally, all empl"
