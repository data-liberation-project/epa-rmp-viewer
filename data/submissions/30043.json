General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RRRA accidental release prevention program is based on several key elements:\n\nOperator Training \u00bf All water treatment plant operators at RRRA are fully licensed by the State of Texas.  In addition, operators receive annual training covering safety and emergency response issues, as mandated by the USEPA.\n\nPreventive Maintenance Program \u00bf RRRA has instituted a preventive maintenance program for the two covered processes to minimize the chance of accidental releases due to process equipment failures.  This includes a formal, periodic maintenance schedule and retention of an adequate spare parts inventory.\n\nAccurate, Effective Operating Procedures \u00bf RRRA has updated its operating procedures, with the participation of process operators.  The procedures address normal operating procedures, as well as steps to be taken during upset conditions, and safety precautions to be observed during all operational phases.\n\nPeriodic Hazard Reviews of Equipment and Procedures \u00bf RRRA has instituted periodic hazard reviews, including Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs).  This function includes reviewing both equipment and procedures, and recommending and instituting changes to improve safety and minimize the chance of accidental releases.\n\nImplementation of an Auditing and Inspection Program \u00bf RRRA is initiating a Process Compliance Audit Program as required by the RMP rule.  This will involve inspection of the processes by an Audit Team familiar with their operation, followed by formal reporting to management and appropriate corrective actions.  Items addressed include adherence to documented operation and maintenance procedures, recordkeeping, and w"

      "SummaryText": "1.  The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nThe Red River Redevelopment Authority (RRRA) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices which complies with relevant applicable requirements and procedures of the USEPA Prevention Program.  The RRRA emergency response policy involves the preparation of process-specific emergency response plans, and is integrated with emergency services available in the surrounding community.  The policy will comply with relevant USEPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nThe RRRA facility includes two (2) processes that are subject to the RMP rule.  The first subject process (Process ID #1), the Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWWTP) Chemical Storage Area is located near the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), and serves as the RRRA\u00bfs primary chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinder storage area.  The cylinders are delivered here and then distributed to the water treatment plants as required.  The IWWTP Chemical Storage Area may contain up to a maximum of six 2,000-pound cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The other remaining process (Process ID #2), the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) treats sewage from both the RRRA and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant (LSAAP), and is located on the LSAAP property.  The WWTP uses chlorine, which is stored in a maximum of two 2,000-pound cylinders.  \n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-case release scenarios were analyzed for both covered processes as mandated by 40 CFR Part 68.25.  USEPA requires that the impacts be calculated based on the release of the entire contents of the largest chemical vessel involved in the process over a ten-minute period.  It should be emphasized that that this is a very unlikely condition, because of the prevention program currently in plac"

      "SummaryText": "hether the process is generally being operated in a safe manner.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators during connection/disconnection of gas cylinders, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  In addition, portable gas measurement instruments have been purchased.\n\nFinally, both RRRA and LSAAP are secure facilities.  Entrants to each facility must pass through a security gate, manned 24-hours per day, and must have a reason for entry.  In addition, both the covered processes are surrounded by chain-link security fences and gated.  The gates are locked whenever an operator is not present on site.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History \n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred over the past five years at the facility. \n\n6.  Emergency Response Program \n\nRRRA has an Emergency Response Program, utilizing the RRAD (Red River Army Depot) fully equipped Fire Department.  The Fire Department includes a total staff of twenty-five, and RRAD has mutual aid agreements in effect with thirteen surrounding communities.  The majority of the Fire Department staff are EMT-trained.  Potential victims can be transferred to full-service hospitals via ambulance or airlift in critical cases.  In addition, the Fire Department conducts its own training on a daily basis, and conducts periodic mock drills to maintain response readiness.\n\nRRRA has a documented plan for emergency notification in case of accidental releases.  The Fire Department phone is staffed 24 hours per day, and the facility\u00bfs internal phone system includes a 911 emergency notification number.  Finally, the RRRA conducts its own safety inspections.  High hazard buildings are inspected monthly, while all other buildings are inspected quarterly.\n\nRRRA has also developed process-specific emergency response procedures.\n\n7.
