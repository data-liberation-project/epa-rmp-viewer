Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activities at the New Martinsville facility are towards the manufacture of polyurethane intermediates, coatings intermediates and thermoplastics.  Products include polyethers, prepolymers, polyesters and aspartic esters. In addition aromatic isocyanates, toluene diisocyanate and polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate are received for reprocessing and repackaging.  The New Martinsville facility uses or stores four of the RMP listed chemicals on the site as of December 17, 2007.  Of the four chemicals covered, three are raw materials and one is a finished product.  All four chemicals were modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the worst case scenario for the facility.  The New Martinsville site MR-I Phosgenation Process, Methylene Dianiline Process and Chlorine Pipeline were shut down in 2007.  The MR-I Phosgenation Process was the location of the worst case and alternative scenarios for phosgene and the alternative scenario for ammonia.  The new worst case scenario chem"

      "SummaryText": "ical for the New Martinsville site is ethylene oxide.  The alternative scenarios in order of potential off-site impact are ethylene oxide, toluene diisocyanate, propylene oxide and ethylene diamine.\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario for the Facility\nThe worst case release scenario for the New Martinsville facility is the rupture of the ethylene oxide storage tank.  Because of the low storage temperature, the release to the atmosphere occurs through evaporation from a pool.   Through use of dispersion modeling (PHAST software), the endpoint distance reaches offsite receptors. This release assumes no mitigation other than containment in a dike.\n\n4.  Alternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative scenarios were developed for all of the RMP chemicals. The alternative scenario for ethylene oxide has the largest potential impact distance of the group. In this scenario it is assumed that a leak develops during the unloading of a rail car.  Under typical weather conditions as suggested in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance the distance to the endpoint reaches offsite receptors.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe New Martinsville Plant complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  Bayer MaterialScience LLC is an active member of the ACC Ethylene Oxide Safety Panel that deals with ethylene oxide safety issues on an industry-wide basis.\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History\nThere have been no releases in the past five years that had off-site consequences.  A liquid TDI release within the plant resulted in an OSHA Recordable Accident in 2007.  The release totaled 10 pounds.  At the New Martinsville facility, there has never be"

Facility Emergency Response Program\nThe New Martinsville facility Emergency Response System consists of volunteer emergency response teams scheduled on each rotating shift.  There are 185 emergency response team members.  They receive 16 to 50 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  An E-Team organization provides secondary support and is staffed by Technical and Managerial Personnel.  The E-Team's main function is to assist and advise the Emergency Response Teams and communicate with outside agencies.  The plant belongs to an industrial mutual aid group called NORIMAC (Northern Ohio River Industrial Mutual Aid Council) that provides mutual aid between the various industries, government agencies, and service organizations in the area.  Community warning sirens are placed in residential areas within 2 miles of the plant and have been in operation, as part of the CAER program, for more than twenty years."
