If the pump is operating, the cracked seal would permit anhydrous ammonia to be released.  Though the area of the crack would be small (estimated at .007 sq. inches), the release would continue until the situation is mitigated by a manual shut-off valve.  This could take two minutes to completely mitigate.  The distance the resulting unconfined vapor travels to the endpoint (point of dispersion of 200 PPM) is less than 500 feet.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor that have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\n     This anhydrous ammonia facility has:  (a.)  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 1910.38, ( b.)  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know-information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA), and ( c.)  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.

Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Wensink Farm Seeds, Inc.  are committed to the prevention of accidental  releases of any hazardous substance from our facility.  This facility has utilize hazardous  products for over forty years without one off-site accidental release.  However, if an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to our neighbors and the environment.  The facility has implemented every constructive suggestion from local fire departments, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Ohio Department of Agriculture's Fertilizer Division, to improve its safety agenda.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     This facility is an agricultural based organization which not only produces and processes seeds, but also markets agricultural fertilizers and chemicals to farmers.  One fertilizer, Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to farmers to be used as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored at our facility, in locked storage tanks, is 620,000 pounds.  The largest tank size is 30,000 gallons and contains 140,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled at one time would occur during the unloading of a delivery tanker holding approximately 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n     A.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.6 miles.\n     B.  The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident.  For our system, this"
