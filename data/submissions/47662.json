The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge.  Also Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n\nThe Scott County LEPC (Alvin Seany 601-469-4100) was given a toure of the facility on December 12, 2006 and were provided this facility's ER Plan at that time.  Tyson Forrest T2 facility also has coordinated its ER plans with the Forest Fire Department, phone (601) 469-1221.\n\nAll Haz-mat courses at Tyson Foods, Inc. are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) (7) and (8).
