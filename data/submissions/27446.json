      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies III your facility.\nThis facility complies with NFP A 58 requirements for propane storage, which is\nmandated by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. If an emergency were to occur, our policy requires that the Fire Department of Mount Joy will be notified and requested to respond.\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled. This facility is a propane terminal, with bulk storage capacity for propane retailers and industrial users.\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios. Our worst-case scenario is a failure of one 90,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a 25-foot long hose rupture caused by a truck pull-away and results in an explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint is onsite and no public receptors are affected.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. This facility complies with EP A' s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFP A 58 and state law.\nThe five-year accident history. We have never had an accident at this facility.\nThe emergency response program. In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Fire Department of Mount Joy and request that they respond to the emergency. Members of the fire department have been at our facility.\nPlanned changes to improve safety. None."
