The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Cargill, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n         The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers, and propane sales and delivery.\n\n           Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. Propane gas is received, stored and distributed for delivery for home heating, farm and commercial business uses.\n\n          The maximum quantity of propane gas would be 65,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n          The maximum quanity of ammonia stored would be 308,000 pounds in our 18,000 and 12,000 gallon storage tanks and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .84 miles.\n\n        The worst case release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 18,000 gallon tank when filled "

According to the EPA lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is .38 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n        The alternative release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 18,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent (65,000 pounds) resulting in two-thirds of a vapor cloud explosion, causing a 1 psi overpressure.  According to the EPA lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is .26 miles (factor of .67 x .38 miles = .26 miles).\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Ahydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In addition, Minnesota Department of Ag Rules.  For Propane, NFPA - 58 rules. \n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going proce"
