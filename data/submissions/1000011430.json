Delta has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response.\n\n1.3\t THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Delta North Channel facility\u00c2\u00bfs primary activities are packaging, warehousing and distribution of chemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below.  Delta North Channel receives the regulated substances in bulk tanker trucks, rail cars and iso tanks and transfers them to 55-gallon drums, 275 gallon totes and other smaller containers.  Filled containers are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite. \nChemical\t                CAS No.\nToxic Substances:\t\nCyclohexylamine\t                108-91-8\nEthylenediamine   \t        107-15-3\nPiperidine\t                110-89-4\nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate\t584-84-9\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate\t91-08-7\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\t        108-05-4\nFlammable Substances:\t\nDimethylamine\t                124-40-3\nEthylamine\t                75-04-7\nIsopropylamine\t                75-31-0\nMethylamine\t                74-89-5\nTriethylamine\t                75-77-4\n\n1.4\tTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE REL"

      "SummaryText": "EASE SCENARIOS\nDelta North Channel is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 \u00c2\u00bf Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Delta is a Program 3 level facility.\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*Comp program was used to evaluate off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenarios for the two toxic regulated chemicals involve the catastrophic failure of a rail car (est. 30,000 gallons.) and a tanker truck (est. 6,000 gallons). The alternative release scenarios for the two toxic chemicals involve the puncture of a drum and release of its entire contents inside the warehouse, (est. 55 gallons). Neither one of these scenarios is likely to result in the actual loss of the entire amount of the regulated substances from the vessel because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniques, but for the worst case and alternative case scenarios these situations were used as potential possibilities that could have offsite consequences, as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and 40 CFR 68.28.\n\n1.5\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nDelta North Channel has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The packaging and warehouse process at the facility is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Delta North Channel is subject to EPCRA Section 313 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information  \nDelta North Channel maintains a record of safety i"

The checklist and what if methods are used to carry out the process hazard analyses. The process hazard analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revised as needed when there is a change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Delta maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nDelta North Channel has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive training before starting work. Operating procedures are reviewed annually and more frequently as needed. \n\nMechanical Integrity \nDelta North Channel carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure valves and systems, hoses and piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdowns systems and controls. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. These personnel receive specialized on the job training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are"

Process operators and maintenance personnel whose job tasks are affected by a change or modification of process conditions are made aware of the changes.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in existing processes are conducted as needed. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation. Attached pre-start-up safety review format was adopted May 2010. \n\nCompliance Audits\nDelta North Channel conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out annually and any corrective actions as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly. \n\nIncident Investigation\nDelta North Channel promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from recurring. Reports are retained in the web based CMS system.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDelta North Channel believes that incident prevention is a team effort and involves employees in the incident prevention process. Delta employees have access to the information created as part of facility\u00c2\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Delta North Channel has a policy of informing the contactors of known potential hazards related to the contactor\u00c2\u00bfs works. Contractors are also informed of emergency procedures should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n1."
