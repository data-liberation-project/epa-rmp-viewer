This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  This Program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility.\r\n\r\nUnilever Foods senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Unilever Foods' safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Plant Engineering Manager, who oversees implementation of the risk prevention policies.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nUnilever Foods is located at 27080 W. 159th Street, in New Century, Kansas.  The facility employs one independent refrigeration system that contains approximately 32,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment cycles ammonia through various states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing and storage of margarine.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors and on the roof of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The margarine processing units (MPUs) operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly freeze product on swept surface heat exchangers.  Ammonia suction from the MPUs, at about 0 psig, passes through the low accumulator before entering the booster compressors.  Any liquid"

      "SummaryText": "ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low side accumulators and returned as high pressure liquid for the system.  The booster discharge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors.  The high side compressor draws suction from the intercooler/high side suction accumulator at about 25 psig (booster discharge).  This accumulator receives suction from various cooler units.  Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the high side accumulator is removed and returned to the system.  The major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to seven condensing towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and for transferring liquid.  A condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the low and high side equipment, including the MPUs, cooler units, and air handlers.  The liquid is pre-cooled in the intercooler vessel before entering the cooler units and a portion of the MPUs.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 to 2005, the system was expanded to include three MPUs and a water chiller, relocation of the roof-mounted air handling unit, replacement of piping on the roof, conversion of the dry warehouse to a storage cooler where three evaporators were added, relocation of one condensing tower, and the addition of two new towers with associated water sump. In 2008, the facility installed a new (Hench) monitoring and control system to improve energy efficiency.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Unilever Foods' ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary repairs in house, but an outside contractor is contracted as needed.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia"

In addition, the facility is designed in accordance with the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) standards applicable at the time.  ASHRAE publishes a safety code for mechanical refrigeration that outlines requirements for occupancy classification, refrigeration systems classification, refrigerant classification, requirements for refrigerant use, design and construction of equipment systems, pressure limiting devices, pressure relief protection, installation requirements, and field pressure test.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, transfer vessels, suction accumulators, intercooler, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  In addition, ammonia sensors are located in the Engine Room 1, Engine Room 2, Engine Room 3, Cooler 1, Cooler 2, Cooler 3, and King Units.  At an ammonia concentration of 50 ppm, the ammonia sensors in Engine Rooms 1, 2, and 3 will activate the audible/visual alarms and trigger exhaust fans to start on \"high\" mode.
