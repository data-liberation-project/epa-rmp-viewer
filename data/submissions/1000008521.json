As a publicly owned utility, LES operates and maintains all of the equipment in the LES system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in conformance with our customer/owner's expectations. LES strives for excellence in its facility operations, and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of our policies and LES continues to comply with federal Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it. We are committed to the accidental release prevention program. \n\nLES is currently revising its thoroughly detailed Emergency Response Plan which specifically addresses an ammonia release for the Rokeby Station. The revised plan will be reviewed with response organizations and others. \n\n2.The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Rokeby Station, owned and operated by LES, provides emergency, peaking and base load electric power generation. There are three gas turbines located on the 160 acre site. To augment power output at the LES Rokeby Station during high summer air temperatures, a cooling system is used to lower turbine inlet air temperatures. The cooling system uses ammonia refrigeration to make ice that is stored in two separate concrete tanks with capacities of 1.1 million gallons and 3 million gallons respectively. The cooling system consists of Ice System #1, which was commercial in 1991, and Ice System #2 which was commercial in 1999.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration cooling system contains a total of approximately 29,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (Ice System #1 and Ice System #2  combined), and this is the maximum plant inventory. This ammonia quantity requires that Rokeby"

      "SummaryText": " Station develop a Risk Management Program and Plan. Rokeby Station is covered by Program 2 requirements. \n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario selected for the Rokeby Station  is the same scenario selected in 1999 and 2004 as it still represents the most amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be released at one time at this location. The scenario is the release of 3,250 lbs of refrigerated anhydrous ammonia from the high pressure receiver tank on Ice System #1. A water deluge from water cannons would significantly reduce the off-site impacts from the release. Modeling shows that the worst-case scenario would have a toxic footprint of 456 yards (0.26 miles) compared to the 1999 footprint of 0.1 miles. The change in dimension of the footprint is attributable to the 2008 revision of wind speed from 4 meters per second in 2004 to 1.5 meters per second in 2008 and the atmospheric stability classification in 2008 has been revised to class C in the ALOHA computer model.\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected in 2004 represents air modeling projections of a 2\" diameter hole in the ice maker of Ice System #1. The scenario is the same as was selected in 1999 because it still represents the most probable scenario where significant amount of anhydrous ammonia could accidentally be released to the atmosphere. This 2004 scenario predicted a toxic footprint of 1,196 yards (0.67 miles) which differs from the 909 yard (0.52 mile) footprint predicted in the 2008 model. The change in dimension of the footprint is attributable to the 2008 revised wind speed of 3 meters per second and atmospheric  stability classification 2004 revised as class C in the ALOHA computer model.\n \n4.The general accidental release program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nRokeby Station has met all of the requirements of RMP Ha"
