      "SummaryText": "The Para-Chem site is located on a 130-acre parcel of land near Simpsonville (Greenville County), South Carolina.  Para-Chem produces acrylic polymers through water-based emulsion polymerization reactions.  This process utilizes a number of chemicals as raw materials, three of which are listed as toxics under 40 CFR 68.130.  Less than 2% of a fourth listed compound, formaldehyde, is a residual reactant in a monomer, N-methylolacrylamide.  Two of these chemicals, acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate monomer, are present in quantities above the threshold limits set forth for the RMP program.  Furthermore, the process in which these chemicals are used is listed under SIC code 2821, making Para-Chem subject to level 3 program requirements.\n\nThe RMP requirements can be divided into two main components: 1) development and implementation of a full risk management program, and 2) documentation and submission of a risk management plan that summarizes key information about the program.  The full risk management program includes a hazard assessment, a management system, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.  The risk management plan is designed to present a summary of the risk management program, and the plan will be made available for review by government agencies and the public.  Para-Chem must submit risk management information to EPA by June 21, 2004.\n\nOf the monomers used at Para-Chem, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, ethyl acrylate, formaldehyde (a minor component in N-methylolacrylamide), methyl methacrylate, styrene, and vinyl acetate are classified as hazardous air pollutants.  Of these compounds acrylonitrile, formaldehyde and vinyl acetate are listed among the regulated toxic compounds for RMP [40 CFR 68.130].  Para-Chem also uses aqueous ammonia, which is a regulated toxic compound for RMP [40 CFR 68.130].  \n\nAcrylonitrile is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.

This allows these facilities to develop an emergency action plan to ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan provided that they coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\nCoordination with local responders also entails the following:\n\u00b7  If the facility has a covered process with a regulated toxic substance, it must be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA regarding a response to a potential release.\n\u00b7  If the facility has a covered process with a regulated flammable, it must ensure that the local fire department is capable of responding to a potential release and aware of its responsibility to do so.\n\nTo document the requirements, the facility should have a record of: \n\u00b7  The emergency contact (i.e., name or organization and number) that would be called for a toxic or flammable release, and\n\u00b7  The organization(s) would assist with response procedures.\n\nPara-Chem operates in a manner that attempts to minimize hazards associated with the handling of chemicals.  Para-Chem has several mechanisms in place for addressing a release of a regulated hazardous substance.
