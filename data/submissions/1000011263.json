The pressure vessels accommodate the receipt of butane and facilitate subsequent butane blending operations.  This is the only regulated process governed by the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation, meeting the NFPA 4 flammability requirements governing RMP. \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Des Moines Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is MMP written policy to notify the Des Moines LEPC and request they respond to the emergency. \n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\n\nAs discussed in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the EPA has defined the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  At Des Moines, the regulated substance is butane which is a flammable substance.  This WCS assumes the entire quantity contained in the largest vessel or section of piping within the butane system releases to the atmosphere, forms a vapor cloud, and is subsequently detonated.  One (1) pound per square inch overpressure is used as the endpoint as this is the threshold for potentially serious injuries to people from flying glass, falling debris, and other explosion effects.  \n\nAt Des Moines the largest quantity of the covered flammable substance, butane, is the largest of the three butane tanks, either tank 2021 or tank 2022, both being 6"

The WCS assumes this vessel in its entirety is released catastrophically to the atmosphere and the vapor cloud formed is ignited and then at some distance from the center of the explosion reaches an endpoint of one (1) PSI overpressure.  A total of 269,018 lbs is the maximum amount of butane that is stored in either vessel taking into account an administrative control limiting the maximum level of butane in the tank to 85%.  Using RMP*Comp to calculate the distance to endpoint, an 0.5 mile radius is estimated to be impacted if the worst case type of release occurred at Des Moines.  \n\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO DESPRICTION\n\nFor the butane storage facility, the alternative case scenario is a release from a pump seal on the loading rack pump.  The seal fails and equates to approximately a A?A? hole.  This pump is downstream of the storage vessels and once the seal leak occurs, the pump is automatically shut down by the temperature transmitter located on the pump seal area within 30 seconds.  Once the pump is shut down, then the driving force is the liquid height of butane stored within the vessel at the time.  For this scenario, the assumption is that the season is summer when the tanks are typically full and the liquid has expanded due to warmer weather, so the full height of the tank is used to estimate the release rate.  The leak is detected by the hazardous gas detectors at the location and then the nearest technician arrives within 5 minutes since the facility is manned 24/7.  The technician evaluates the situation and puts on the proper PPE and isolates the pump by closing the suction and discharge valves after another 10 minutes have passed resulting in a total release time of 15 minutes.  \n\nIn this situation, modeling the scenario as a vapor cloud fire using RMP*Comp, the release rate is estimated to be 475 lbs per min and the estimated distance to the lower flammability limit is less than 0.1 miles.  The total amount released is 7125 lbs"

The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The butane storage and distribution system is governed by OSHA's PSM regulation.  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the tanks and equipment. \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the covered processes at Des Moines Terminal that have required reporting under the RMP rule.  Furthermore, Des Moines Terminal has never had an accident involving butane or propane that has resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in place. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  The terminal is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Within the past five years, the process has no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b) (1)).  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP.  The undersigned certifies to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed and reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete. \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane blending process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the new butane process arise at the Des Moines Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Termi"
