Box 399\nLockport, LA 70374\n\n\nRisk Management Plan\n2009 Update\n\n\nExecutive Summary:  North Treatment Plant\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your site\n\nDue to new regulations under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the District has developed a Risk Management Plan for chlorine gas.  The requirements involve instituting a prevention plan to avoid unnecessary chlorine leaks in addition to revising its existing emergency response procedure.  The expectations of the above mentioned requirements are to allow minimal injury and damage to occur, as well as to provide aid and guidance for other responders in the event of an accident.\n\nThe prevention plan, developed by the District, has been designed to ensure that all precautions are taken so as to prevent and mitigate any possible chlorine release.  One element of this plan is to assess the chlorine process for potential hazards that could contribute to a leak then correct the problems immediately.  Another essential component is written operating procedures for all duties associated with chlorine, while another is to provide proper training to employees involved in those duties.  From now on, all training and inspection information will be documented for future reference.\n\nThe revised emergency response plan has been implemented with the intention that plant personnel will respond, contain and repair all chlorine leaks.  One reason for this is because we feel our employees are properly trained and experienced enough to resolve the problem in a timely manner.  Another reason is because plant policy allows chlorine cylinders to be handled only during normal working hours. Consequently, most releases will occur at this time while enough qualified people are present to initiate a response.  Nonetheless, it is possible to have a release after hours, but because two people are on site at all times they will be able to mitigate the situation. \n"

North  Treatment Plant is located on LA Highway 1 just south of the Country Club Subdivision in Thibodaux.  The physical address is 1052 Highway 1, Thibodaux. \n\nBackground Information:\nThe Lafourche Parish Water District No. 1- North Treatment Plant is a potable drinking water production facility.  The District purifies water taken from Bayou Lafourche and distributes the water to customers throughout Lafourche Parish.\nChlorine gas is used as a disinfectant in the treatment process and is fed continuously.  The District has one (1) ton chlorine cylinders on site.  Plant personnel remove the one (1) ton cylinders when empty and replace them with full cylinders.  This involves transporting cylinders with a forklift, lifting the cylinders with a hoist, and mounting a regulator onto the cylinder valve.  These chlorine cylinders are only replaced during normal working hours due to safety concerns.      \nDistrict personnel can deal with most emergency response and repair situations; nonetheless, outside assistance may be necessary depending on the severity of the leak.  A?BA? repair kits, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and extra air bottles are stored in an emergency response and repair cart and is available for quick response.  Containment suits and gloves can also be found in the cart.   \nSugarcane surrounds the plant on two sides with LA Highway 1 and the Country Club Subdivision on the other two.  The closest residence is located approximately 200 feet north of the plant.\n\nThe Worst Case scenario and the Alternative Case scenario\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst case scenario for a chlorine gas release is when the total content of a one ton cylinder is expelled within ten minutes.  In this event, the total quantity released is 2000 pounds with the release rate being 200 pounds per minute.  The variables used in determining the distance that "

When these conditions exist, the toxic endpoint is 3.04 miles according to the ALOHA model, CLW-2, in A?Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment PlantsA?.  The population affected by this scenario is approximately 20,000 people.  No environmental receptors would be affected in such a case; however, schools, recreational areas, businesses, residences, and a hospital are within the 3.04 mile endpoint.  For this reason, it is crucial that extreme precautions be taken to prevent this from ever occurring.\n\n \nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe most likely case scenario of a chlorine gas release for Lafourche Parish Water Dist. #1 is a malfunctioning valve on the cylinder itself.  Using the ALOHA model, CLA-3, in A?Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment PlantsA?, the release rate for a malfunctioning valve is 10.5 pounds per minute.  Because this scenario will tend to occur during normal working hours, as explained above, the time taken to repair the leak will be minimal.  It is estimated that it takes approximately sixty (60) minutes to repair a leak such as this.  Accordingly, this would allow 317 pounds of chlorine to be expelled.  The variables used in determining the distance that the gas travels is a rural topography, an F-stability class (atmospheric conditions), and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s.  When these conditions exist, the toxic endpoint is 0.57 miles according to the ALOHA model.  The population affected by this scenario is approximately 1,400 people.

SheriffA?s Office, Fire Dept.            911\nState Police                        (225) 925-6595\nLaf. Parish Emerg. Planning Comm.        (985) 446-8427, (537-7603)\nChem Trec                        (800) 424-9300\nNational Response Center                (800) 424-8802\nDept. of Environmental Quality            (985) 532-6206    \nDetailed information of the situation will be given, including wind direction and the designated assembly area.  Depending on available personnel, someone will meet the responders at the front gate to update them on the situation and direct them to the response.\n\n\nShelter / Evacuation (Employee)\nA decision as to evacuate or to shelter-in-place will be made by the Ranking Supervisor at the time of the incident.  Generally, a major Chlorine release will last at most 30-40 minutes, therefore, shelter-in-place will more than likely be used in an emergency situation.  If shelter-in-place is initiated, all air conditioning must be shut off and all vents, windows, and doors closed.  \n\n\nPublic Notification\nIf outside assistance is required, the SheriffA?s Office, State Police, and the Fire Department will be notified. Evacuation or shelter-in-place of residences will be at the discretion of the Law Enforcement Agencies. These agencies may choose to shelter residences within A? mile of the plant.  If so, residences should be instructed to shut windows, close any ventilation system, and listen for further advisories.\n\n\nPhone Answering      \nDuring normal working hours, the front office will answer telephone calls, whereas after hours, any available personnel will do so.\n\n\nMedia Inquiry\nThe media will be updated by one person who is authorized to do so at the appropriate time.

Any person discussing the incident should not speculate as to the cause, but should advise the media that the situation is under investigation.  If the cause is known, so advise.\n\n\nEmergency Treatment\nAny injured employee or responder suffering from Chlorine inhalation should be sent to the hospital immediately.  First aid can be administered if applicable.  Medical management information provided as attachment 7.30.\n\n\nAll Clear\nThe Ranking Supervisor will determine when the situation is no longer threatening.  He will then notify all parties involved as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nResponse and Repair Training\nChlorine leak repair training will be conducted a minimum of every other year, but is generally held yearly.  Also, drills are periodically performed to familiarize employees with an emergency situation.  \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n \nAlthough the WCS and the ACS do not indicate this, all chlorine cylinders are housed indoors for additional protection and containment.  We have begun a more aggressive training, maintenance, and inspection program as per an audit conducted on March 17, 2002.  We have posted more warning signs and labels throughout the facility, and installed an additional windsock as per a hazard review conducted on February 6, 2004.  On September 17, 2007, a chlorine scrubber was placed in service as an additional safety precaution.  We also improved the posting of warning signs, labeled chlorine solution lines, developed new lockout/tagout SOPs, and posted refresher memos concerning several items involving the chlorine process as a result of a hazard review and RMP update in March of 2009.\n\n"
