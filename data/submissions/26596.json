      "SummaryText": "DSM Desotech, Inc., Stanley, NC\n\nFacility Description and Operations\n\nThe DSM Desotech, Inc. facility in Stanley, North Carolina formulates and manufactures ultraviolet light (UV) and electron beam (EB) cured coatings and resins that are used by various industries in a multitude of applications. For example, one specific industry that frequently uses DSM\u00bfs products is the fiber-optic cable industry. The Stanley, North Carolina facility houses offices, a research and development laboratory, manufacturing activities, and a warehouse for raw materials and finished product.\n\nProduction of the coatings is completed in a process that is analogous to cooking from a recipe. For a given batch of product that is being produced, there is a specification (similar to a recipe) that dictates the raw materials used, the procedures for mixing them together, and how to complete the reaction. Weigh tanks (similar to measuring cups), blend tanks (similar to mixing bowls) and reactors (similar to pots and pans) are used in the process. Reactions typically take 12 to 24 hours to complete, and when the reaction is finished, the original raw materials have been polymerized. Polymerization is the same process that causes liquid cake batter to become a solid cake once it is baked. In this case, DSM\u00bfs products are only partially polymerized. Final polymerization and the formation of a solid \u00bfdry\u00bf coating happens only upon product exposure to ultraviolet light (u.v.) in a customer\u00bfs process.\n\nBecause of the time required to complete a batch of product, DSM production is completed over five 24-hour days.\n\nMaterials\n\nDSM Desotech employs a variety of organic chemicals in the production of UV/EB coatings and resins. General classes of chemicals used include acrylates, polyols, isocyanates, monomers, photoinitiators, inhibitors and diluents. In addition, an acetone solvent cleaning system is sued to clean the equipment used in production.\n\nThe only chemical subject to the Risk Management Program"

      "SummaryText": "(RMP) requirements of 40 CFR 68.130 that is used by DSM is toluene diisocyanate (TDI), mixed isomers (CAS Registry Number 26471-62-5). TDI is listed as a toxic liquid. The threshold quantity of TDI for RMP applicability is 10,000 pounds in any single process. Processes that were identified to be subject to RMP based on the quantity of TDI in the process consist of delivery/unloading and storage. Although TDI is received and stored in quantities that exceed the RMP applicability threshold, there are no product formulations that require an excess of 10,000 pounds of TDI to be used to produce a batch of product.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nA worse case release scenario was conducted assuming a release of 7133 gallons of TDI from a storage tank. As dictated in 40 CFR 68.25(d), the release scenario was assumed to be an instantaneous release of the contents of the largest vessel. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint was calculated using RMP*Comp. The results of the modeling indicated a distance to the endpoint of 0.6 miles. The corresponding release rate was calculated to be 0.0189 pounds per minute, and the release duration was 3,820,000 hours. The results were obtained assuming worst-case meteorology and release into a diked area.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a break in a transfer line during truck unloading. RMP*Comp was again used to determine the release rate of 2,980 pounds and the distance to the endpoint of 0.1 miles. The alternative scenario assumed a certain tank pressure, pipe diameter, and pool area.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at the site from the regulated processes within the last five years that resulted in either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nDSM has established procedures in case of an emergency at the facility. These procedures assign responsibility for implementing the emerge"

The Stanley Fire Department and the Gaston County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been notified of DSM\u00bfs emergency response procedures.\n\nAccident Prevention\n\nDSM has established a series of safe work practices that are used to minimize the likelihood of a hazardous material release. Practices are updated or added as necessary to address any newly identified hazards. In the event of a release, passive mitigation (i.e., dikes, building enclosure) is available to prevent migration of the spilled material beyond the plant building itself.\n\nCommitment to Safety, Health and Environment\n\nDSM Desotech, Inc. aims to maintain business activities that do not adversely affect safety or health, and it is therefore the objective of the company to evaluate its practices and processes to ensure that they are safe to employees, the public, and the environment. DSM\u00bfs corporate policy on Safety, Health and the Environment is consistent with the Responsible Care Programme of the European Chemical Industry Council and with the International Chamber of Commerce Business Charter for Sustainable Development.\n\nDSM complies with a variety of safety and environmental regulations including the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) Sections 301-303 (Emergency Planning), Sections 311/312 (Hazardous Chemical Inventory Reporting), and Section 313 (Toxic Release Inventory Reporting); Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Section 1910.38 for worker safety; and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 9RCRA) Section 40 CFR 262 for large quantity hazardous waste generators."
