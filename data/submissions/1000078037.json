As of today, Thursday, 4-18-19, the existing executive summary accurately reflects our RMP.  We have added quarterly RMP/PSM meetings conducted by Envirosafe Safety Consultants.  The Public Works Director, Plants Maintenance Supervisor & Manager and Water Treatment Senior staff attend these meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 2014, the City of Reidsville resumed management of the Water Treatment Plant from United Water (Suez) after 21.5 years. Prior to January 1, 2014, United Water's (Suez) Environmental Health and Safety personnel based in Atlanta, Georgia were the manager for the Plant's RMP/PSM program.  All audits during the 21.5 years are located on the property of United Water (Suez).  We updated PSM Compliance Manual that was developed for the site and all personnel were trained. As Superintendent of the Water Treatment facility, I am the manager of the PSM/RMP program.\r\n\r\nKey items included in our manual are:\r\n\r\no\tWritten site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\r\n\r\no\tChlorine safety information as required by the regulations\r\n\r\no\tStandard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\r\n\r\no\tChlorine system maintenance procedures \r\n\r\no\tTraining on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\r\n\r\no\tConducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the three chlorine processes\r\n\r\no\tDeveloping an initial Emergency Response Plan \r\n\r\no\tTraining in support of the certification of operators\r\n          \r\nThe plant superintendent and the company safety managers annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations. Recent activities include RMP Self-Audits in December 2016 to review the DEQ requirem"

This process has proven to reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. In 2016, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. We participate in the County LEPC meetings and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. The services of a professional organization to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are routinely conducted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Reidsville has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\r\n\r\nAt the Water Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\r\n\r\n- GHS Hazard Communications\r\n- Personal Protective Equipment\r\n- Lockout/Tagged\r\n- Confined Space\r\n- Emergency Action Plan\r\n- Emergency Spill Response\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries and no reportable chlorine releases since the City of Reidsville resumed management. \r\n\r\nThe Plant has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program and has retained Envirosafe Consulting to assist with chemical safety, EHS, PSM/RMP and training."
