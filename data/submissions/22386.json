      "SummaryText": "The Burr Oak Water Treatment facility supplies potable water to Burr Oak State Park and residences in the surrounding area. The primary use of the plant is the treatment of surface water from Burr Oak Lake for drinking water purposes. The use of chlorine gas is a major component of the treatment process. The chlorine used at the facility is containerized in 150-lb. steel cylinders. Up to 16 cylinders are stored at the Plant at one time. Only four of the cylinders can be on-line at one time.\n\nThe facility has made a committment to safety and the implementation of safe work procedures by stressing on-the-job training and encouraging continued awareness of safe working procedures. A review of Plant working procedures has been conducted in conjunction with this RMP.\n\nA worst-case scenario has been conducted fro a chlorine gas release from the Burr Oak Plant using RMP*COMP software obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The scenario assumed a release of al 2400 lbs. of chlorine gas stored at the facility. An alternative release was also conducted using the RMP*COMP software. This scenario assumed a release of 600 lbs. of chlorine gas. Enclosure of the cylinders in the treatment building was considered as active mitigation for the modeled scenarios.\n\nThe Burr Oak facility has coordinated emergency response services with local and county police, fire and the Athens County Emergency Management Agency. The Plant can also expect response from the Logan Fire Department Hazardous Materials response unit in the case of an emergency. A written emergency response plan has been developed in conjunction with this RMP. Awareness level training has been provided to the staff at the Burr Oak faciltiy, covering the RMP. \n\nIn response to the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL 106-40), the Burr Oak Plant conducted a public meeting to discuss elements of the RMP. This meeting was held on January 24, 2000. Notification of"
