Battle Creek Farmers \nCooperative - Plainview, NE stores more than the threshold quantity\nof anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds) for commercial sale as fertilizer.   \nTherefore, Battle Creek Farmers Cooperative - Plainview, NE is required \nto submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR 68.150 by \nJune 20, 1999.\n\nThe Battle Creek Co-op is committed to operating in a safe and \ncompliant manner.

Information includes information pertaining to the hazards \nof ammonia, process technology, process equipment, and emergency \nresponse procedures.\n\nThe stationary source is the Battle Creek Farmers Cooperative - \nPlainview, NE anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer facility. The \nlargest process group (e.g., storage tanks or group of interconnected \ntanks) has a storage capacity of 30,000 water gallons (140,000 pounds).  \nThe total stationary storage capacity is 140,000 pounds.  The facility also \nstores numerous smaller transportable tanks(nurse tanks) that are \nactually used in the fertilizer application process.\n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario \nper 40 CFR 68.165(a)(2) to determine program applicability.  Battle \nCreek Co-op has chosen to use the DEGADIS+ to determine offsite \nimpacts.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Parameters\n     1.   Land Use - Rural\n     2.   Release Qty - 140,000 lb \n     3.   Release Rate - 14,000 lb/min\n     4.   Release Duration - 10 min\n\nFor this facility, a worst-case release would occur in the event that a \nprimary ammonia tank would rupture and the entire contents would be \nreleased to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The worst-case scenario \nrequires a ground-level release height (0 feet).  Release calculations \nare presented below:\n          \nSample Endpoint Calculation\n          \nGiven:       The Storage Tank Capacity is 30,000 water gallons\n             ANSI K61.1 filling density = 56 % (of water wt.)\n\nRelease Rate   = Tank Capacity / 10 minutes\n          = (30,000 gal * 8.345 lb/gal water)*(0.56)  / 10 min \n          = (250,350 lb)*(0.56) / 10 min\n          = 140,000 (rounded) / 10 min\n          = 14,000 lb/min \n\nInput of the preceding data into DEGADIS+ model, the results indicate a \nworst-case impact of"

The residential \npopulation within a 2.1 mile radius of the facility is 1,400 (rounded) \nbased on the 1990 US Census data.   \n\nThe facility is required to complete one alternate release scenario per \n40 CFR Part 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative release scenario considered \nis in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and \n68.28.  Alternative release parameters are presented below:\n\nAlternative Scenario Parameters\n\n    1.   Land Use - Rural                 \n    2.   Release Qty - 600 lb           \n    3.   Release Rate - 60 lb/min \n    4.   Release Duration - 10 min\n\nThe alternative scenario chosen for this facility involves a release \nbecause of a sudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this \nscenario is still unlikely because the transfer hoses used have \nmultiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless steel wire \nunderneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it \nis more likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  \nThis scenario is also the\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor \nline to the tank truck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture \narea is assumed at 0.5 square inches.  Because personnel are always \npresent at the facility during transfer, Battle Creek Co-op personnel \nwill respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using the \nOCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).\n\nInput of the preceding data into DAGADIS+ revealed an alternative \nrelease scenario impact of 0.23 miles for the facility. There is an \nestimated impact on 3 people located within 0.23 miles from the \nfacility.  The amount of ammonia that would have to be released to \nreach this residence is as unlikely as the worst-case scenario.
