The same properties that make chlorine/sulfur dioxide valuable for our needs also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine/sulfur dioxide to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workerse threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute recommendations, as well as Federal, State and County guidelines.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and other regulatory agencies, who would in turn notify andy potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat wastewater.  Chlorine/sulfur dioxide is brought by truck in 1-ton containers.  Up to 5 chlorine 1-tons and 3 sulfur dioxide are on site.\n\nFailure of the largest container when filled to the greatest amount could release 2350 pounds of chlorine/sulfur dioxide.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 3.4 miles.\n\nBecause there are extensive ssafety features at  the facility including a scrubber,  vacuum regulators and automatic valves on the container heads, any loss of vacuum downstream would result immediately in shutting off the gas supply.  In such an event the maximum amount of chlorine/sulfur dioxide release would be the amount in the 5/8\" pipe would be about 3 lbs.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative scenario is 0.1 mile.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.
