Also, equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposure.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nWe have had no incidents at the Gastonia plant involving substances included in the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nWe have in place a written emergency response plan that we coordinate with the Gaston County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Crowders Mountain Volunteer Fire Department and other local responders. Lubrizol personnel are active in the LEPC. New personnel are trained on the plan contents and in their duties in the event of an emergency upon initial hiring. All personnel are trained on the plan contents and their duties at least annually. The plant emergency response plan meets the requirements of RMP as well as all other EPA and OSHA requirements. Internal evacuation drills are practiced at least annually.\n\nLubrizol Gastonia is a founding member of the South Gastonia Community Advisory Panel (CAP). This group meets at least twice per year to discuss health, safety, environmental or security issues from the plant which may impact the surrounding community. CAP meetings are attended by local emergency responders, plant neighbors, local elected officials and other concerned citizens.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nWe expect scenarios such as these alternative release cases and worst cases to be highly hypothetical because of our proven accident prevention programs and operating history.

Some recent changes drive out of PHA & LOPA analyses include installing Safety Instrumented System (SIS) on our hazardous monomer unloading operations and storage tanks and installing a new Acrylonitrile storage tank with SIS safety controls. \n\n2. Process Design - Our processes are designed for safety in accordance with applicable industry standards and best engineering practices. Designs include, as appropriate, automatic emergency shutdown systems, pressure relief devices, ventilation systems and release sensing systems. Most operations containing chemicals are computer controlled via a Distributed Control System (DCS) with trained chemical operators acting as backup and monitors. DCS controls include continuous monitoring of critical operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, tank levels, flowrates and valve positions. DCS controls have inputs to detect abnormal conditions requiring automatic shutdown and alarms. All production areas have sufficient containment, that in the event of a leak, no material will be discharged to the environment. Secondary containment dikes surround all storage tank areas.\n\n3. Training - Operations and maintenance personnel are thoroughly trained on their job tasks, on safe work practices as they apply to their jobs and emergency contingency actions, before they may operate or maintain equipment. They also receive refresher training periodically. Our operating and maintenance procedures, general safety procedures and emergency response procedures are fully documented and updated for any changes in plant operations.\n\n4. Maintenance - Each item of safety-critical equipment at our plant that is involved in maintaining safety or responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested and/or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition.\n\n5.

This program requires implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to mitigate the effects of any release that might occur. Some highlights of our program are:\n\n1. Process Hazard Analyses - Formal process hazard analyses (PHAs) have been performed on all plant operations involving regulated substances. PHAs are conducted by a team of personnel from a variety of plant experience backgrounds to ensure all aspects of operation are considered. During PHAs, each piece of equipment involved in the process is individually evaluated for its fitness for duty considering all expected operating conditions. Startup, shutdown and upset conditions are also considered. During PHAs, design and equipment weaknesses are investigated to eliminate the weakness or reduce its impact. Measures are in place to continuously update this information on a regular revalidation and review schedule. Part of Lubrizol\u0092s PHA methodology is to perform Layers of Protection Analyses(LOPA) on individual scenarios when the perspective risk in not clearly defined or hard to quantify/resolve during the PHA. PHA\u0092s and LOPA\u0092s are conducted by a team of Lubrizol personnel with the guidance of an outside consultant facilitator with many years of experience evaluating similar facilities.

The site manufactures more than 200 products sold throughout the world. The plant is located approximately three miles south of downtown Gastonia just outside the City limits. The Gastonia facility covers 23 acres, nine of which contains three separate manufacturing plants. The site was initially developed by Maurice Walsh as Walsh Chemical Company in 1973. In 1994, BFGoodrich acquired the site. The plant currently employs 78 people. The site is serviced by Norfolk-Southern Railroad, is adjacent to US Route 321, and is less than 10 miles from Interstate 85.\n\nLubrizol is proud to be a part of this hard working community. The plant and its employees have generously supported the area through the United Way, Volunteer Fire organizations, The Salvation Army, The Shrine Club, Special Olympics, American Business Women's Association, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America, HH Beam, Lingerfelt, Pleasant Ridge Elementary Schools, Holbrook and Southwest Middle Schools as well as many other local and national charities.\n\nNearly all finished products manufactured at the Gastonia plant are non-hazardous. In the manufacture of these products, chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule are used. The RMP regulated chemicals for this site are acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate. Even before the RMP rule was written, Lubrizol Gastonia had programs in place to prevent serious accidents involving chemicals.

Our safety policies and practices have historically preceded the regulation of such practices under, for example, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.\n\nThe risk communication objective for Lubrizol is that its operating plants will be well prepared to deal with risk communication issues in their local communities and be prepared to act decisively to minimize any impact to the community resulting from industrial activities. Each Lubrizol plant regulated by the US EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR 68 will complete a comprehensive RMP Plan and submit it to the appropriate state regulatory agency. This RMP Plan will include an RMP Communication Plan for the plant within its local community. The objective of the RMP Communication Plan is that the plant will be prepared to:\n\n- Provide a realistic communication perspective on RMP information and on the plant's RMP submittal\n- to EPA.\n- Explain the plant's prevention program and safeguards.\n- Provide appropriate information about the plant's emergency response procedures.\n- Explain the plant's products and positive impact on the surrounding community.\n\nRisk communication is an integral part of a comprehensive risk management program at Lubrizol that meets or exceeds all requirements of the US EPA RMP rule as well as the OSHA rule 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM).
