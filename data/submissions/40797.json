      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Eden Prairie has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Water Treatment Facility located at 14100 Technology Drive; Eden Prairie, MN 55344.  The purpose of this plan is to help prevent or minimize risk of exposure to chlorine gas for both the employees of the facility and the surrounding community.\n\nI. FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Eden Prairie Water Treatment Plant is capable of treating a maximum daily water flow of 28 million gallons per day.  The normal daily flow is 6.5 million gallons per day.  The facility uses approximately 400 pounds per day of chlorine to disinfect the water system.  During normal operations the facility may have to 24,000 pounds of chlorine stored on site.  The chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound containers.\n\nThe facility is required to create a Risk Management Plan in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency Regulation 40 CFR 68.  Creation of this RMP also provides compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirement in OSHA Regulation 20 CFR 1910.119.  A Facility follows this regulation when it houses more than a threshold quantity of a regulated material for use in its processes.  Eden Prairie Water Treatment Facility maintains more than the threshold 2,500 pounds of chlorine on site at any given time.  An original RMP was created and submitted to the EPA in June of 1999.  This edition represents the required five-year update of that earlier Plan.\n\nII. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe Eden Prairie Water Treatment Plant has a state of the art facility for safely handling and feeding chlorine into the City?s water system.  The system was put online in March of 1998 and incorporates the most modern technology.\n\nThe chlorine feed system operates on a vacuum principal with automatic shut-off valves if the vacuum is interrupted.  This minimizes the risk of a major release due to damage of the chlorine piping system.  The facility is also equipped with a chlorine scrubber.  In the case of a majo"

      "SummaryText": "r leak, the scrubber is capable of removing 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas from the air prior to being vented to the atmosphere.  This is the primary line of defense in protecting the surrounding community from the hazards associated with a major chlorine release.  All release scenarios used in the plan assume the scrubber is not operational during the release.  In reality, a major chlorine release would not have any noticeable effect on the surrounding community because the scrubber would remove the chlorine prior to release.  The assumption of an inactive scrubber during a major release is considered a worst case scenario.  The facility is also equipped with an emergency generator capable of running the entire plant during a power outage.\n\nIII. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Eden Prairie Facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  Emergency response would only be used in the rare occurrence that there is a major release and that the chlorine scrubber is not used.  In the event of a major release, an employee of the Fire Department would then assess if a HAZMAT team is needed.  These organizations are trained in handling emergency situations and hazardous materials.  These agencies would be responsible for mitigating the effects of chlorine release and coordinating evacuation procedures if necessary.\n\nA training program has been established to ensure that all employees of the treatment facility can identify an emergency situation and understand the procedure for notifying the proper personnel.  As part of this program, facility employees will annually meet with representatives of the fire department to discuss potential hazards.  This will also allow the fire department to gain familiarity with the layout of the treatment plant and grounds.\n\nIV. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RMP/PSM PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has implemented written procedures in compliance with the RMP/PSM regulations to help minimize the risk of a chlorine release.  The updated RMP/PSM Manu"
