The state of the art ammonia facility is designed and operated by current CDO standards. Seabrook Brothers and Sons, Inc. have and will continue to maintain Process Safety Management as a high priority.\n\n\nFacility Description:\n\nSeabrook operates an ammonia refrigeration system at their Seabrook facility. Ammonia refrigeration is a major constituent in the processing of frozen vegetables. Refrigeration is accomplished with a closed loop two-stage system utilizing compressors, evaporators and condensers.\n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios:\n\nRMP-Comp was utilized to perform the worst-case and alternate case scenario for the ammonia facility. Total loss from the receiver, located in an enclosure, was chosen as the worst-case scenario, and the rupture of the unloading hose was chosen as the alternate case. \n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nSeabrook is presently regulated by New Jersey TCPA, OSHA PSM and EPA 112r which incorporate all of the philosophies and criteria for Process Safety Management. Since 1989 Seabrook Brothers and Sons have managed the facility with an approved Risk Management Program (RMP). The RMP is audited on a yearly basis and which will continue even though EPA only requires a three-year cycle.\n\n\nFive -Year Accident History:\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Emergency Response Program consists of the following elements:\n\n    On-Site Emergency Response Team,\n    Governmental Responders,\n    Emergency Notification,\n    Procedures and measures for emergency response aft"

These past reviews required evaluations against criteria for design and operation and state-of-the-art. Based on these evaluations Seabrook determined that the ammonia facility is designed and operated under acceptable risk and no further risk reductions measures are necessary at this time."
