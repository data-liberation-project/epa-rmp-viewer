      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWestRock CP, LLC Mill (the Mill) management is committed to providing the optimum in employee and public safety and health.  It is the policy of Mill management to assure, as far possible, that every employee has a safe place in which to work.  The Mill management provides the resources necessary to fulfill these commitments.  It is also the policy of the Company to expect each employee, contract employee, and visitor to live up to the responsibility of following all safety rules and committing to safety.\r\n\r\nIt is Mill policy to ensure adequate emergency response capabilities exist to handle an on-site emergency involving RMP-covered chemicals.  The Mill maintains an emergency response plan that addresses how to respond in the event of chemical releases.  The key is prevention.  The Mill executes RMP policies through employee training, equipment purchases and maintenance, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nMill Description\r\n\r\nThe Mill is located along the northern bank of the Pamunkey River at 1901 Main Street, in West Point, Virginia.  The Mill started operations in 1913 with the construction of a pioneer mill at the head of the York River.  In 1914, Chesapeake Pulp & Paper Company began making pulp, which was sold to other mills.   St. Laurent Paper Products Corporation purchased the Mill in 1997.  In 2001, Stone Container Corporation purchased the Mill from St. Laurent Paper Products Corporation. Rock-Tenn Company purchased the company in 2011, and the company changed names to WestRock in 2015 when it merged with Mead Westvaco.\r\n\r\nThe Mill handles chlorine dioxide and aqueous ammonia, which are chemicals listed in 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  The Mill operates under the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 2611, now recognized under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 32211, one of nine highly hazardous SI"

In addition, these processes are subject to requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore, the processes are subject to RMP Program 3 requirements, and are considered RMP Covered Processes.\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide is manufactured on site for use in the Mill bleach plant.  It is produced by combining sodium chlorate, methanol, and sulfuric acid.  The Mill produces a 10 gram per liter chlorine dioxide solution, which is stored in three aboveground storage tanks.  These tanks have total capacities of 101,500 gallons, 126,900 gallons, and 144, 000 gallons.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia (aqueous, 29.5%) is purchased for use in the Mill wastewater treatment plant.  Ammonia is delivered to the site via tanker truck.  The ammonia is stored in a 15,600-gallon tank, which is the maximum intended inventory of aqueous ammonia.  \r\n\r\nPollution Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Mill has a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, an Emergency Action Plan that contains an Emergency Response Plan, and an Operations Manuals for Offloading Chemicals.  These plans outline the procedures in place at the mill to prevent pollution and respond to releases or emergencies.  Prevention measures include training, inspections, integrity testing and engineering controls.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information relating to the RMP Covered Processes is divided into three categories:  chemical hazards, process technology, and process equipment.  Process Safety Information relating to the chemical hazards is included in Safety Data Sheets that are kept in readily-accessible locations for Mill employees. Process Safety Information relating to the RMP Covered Processes is generally indicated on process drawings and is referenced in application operating procedures and Process Hazard Analyses reports.  Process Safety Information relating to RMP Covere"

PHAs for both the chlorine dioxide and ammonia processes were last re-evaluated in April 2017.  PHAs are conducted by a team of knowledgeable individuals representing, at the minimum: operations, maintenance, engineering, and safety.  PHAs address the hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents that had a likely potential for a catastrophic release, engineering, and administrative controls applicable to the hazards.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nWritten operating procedures are maintained by the Department responsible for the RMP Covered Processes.  Copies of the procedures are reviewed regularly by operations personnel and are readily available on the Mill Electronic Data Management System (EDMS). Standard Operating Procedures and Policies relating to the Mill RMP Covered Processes are available electronically on the EDMS.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Mill provides on-the-job and/or classroom training to employees responsible for operating the RMP Covered Processes.  The trainees must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the supervisor that they posses the skills and knowledge to perform the required duties prior to being assigned the responsibilities.  Hazard Communication and Chemical Training are provided to each operations employee.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Mill maintains written instructions for inspection and testing of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping, emergency shutdown systems, controls, alarms, and interlocks that are part of the RMP Covered Processes.  Tests and inspections follow applicable and acceptable codes and standards.  Inspection and testing is performed at a frequency called for by the applicable codes and more often if test data indicate it is warranted.  Maintenance procedures are house"

Critical safety and environmental pieces of equipment are given top priority.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Mill has a Management of Change policy and guidance procedures to implement a review process when any component of the RMP Covered Process is modified, replaced, or upgraded beyond replacement in kind components or design.  Quality control procedures reside on an electronic database available to operators and are tied into interlock protection mechanisms built into the process so operators cannot willingly make changes to quality control operating procedures without prior approval.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\r\nThe Mill has a policy indicating the necessity to perform pre-startup safety reviews for new RMP Covered Processes and prior to implementing a significant modification (as detailed at 40 CFR 68.77(a)) to a RMP Covered Process.  Documentation is in place to demonstrate that a pre-startup safety review was completed prior startup of a new, or significantly modified, RMP Covered Process.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe Mill conducts audits of RMP Covered Processes at least every three years.  The most recent audit was conducted in 2015 and one is scheduled for 2018.  The audits consist of a records review and evaluation of on-site conditions, which are performed by third-party consulting companies with qualified auditors.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nIncident investigations are conducted for incidents that result in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a RMP Covered Process chemical.
