ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nFC Tracy Holdings conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\r\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nFC Tracy Holdings uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. Drawings in RMP Binder Chapter 8 - Appendix 8.1 show the facility location map and site plan.\r\nFC Tracy Holdings has over 10,000 lbs. of ammonia in any single refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in product storage cooling, glycol chilling, water chilling and ice generation operations. There are two (2) separate standalone refrigeration systems at the facility. These processes are Main System and the Ice Generator Trailer (IG-1). Only Main System has ammonia quantity that is above federal threshold quantity. Ice generator trailer has less than federal threshold quantity but still more"

Main System equipment includes high- and low-pressure receivers, suction accumulators, screw compressor packages, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporators, evaporative condensers, and plate frame heat exchangers w/surge drums and hydrocooler coils with surge drums. The ammonia charge of the Main is approximately 42,410 lbs., during the times ice generator trailer is not on site and 40,910 lbs. when the ice generator trailer is brought on site. \r\n\r\nIce Generator Trailer : (IG-1) equipment includes low-pressure receiver, screw compressor package, ammonia pump, ice maker and evaporative condenser. IG-1 will be on site seasonally April through November and will be transferred to Brawley facility at the end of the season. This system has approximately 1,500 lbs. of ammonia. Ammonia charge for the IG-1 will be provided from the main system. Trailer will be charged from the main system at the beginning of the season and ammonia will be unloaded back to main system once the season is over.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of ammonia currently at the site is approximately 42,410 lb. Public receptors are located within the worst-case accidental release toxic endpoint area.\r\n\r\nFacility will be operational initially April through November seasonally, but facility will be operational throughout the year within next two years.

Cold rooms house evaporators, and pressure cooler bunker coils and vessels. Ice maker area inside the cold room has two plate in frame water chillers with surge drums. Processing room and box mezzanine has glycol units instead of ammonia evaporators to minimize to exposure of employees to ammonia equipment.\r\n\r\nThe compressors have safety cutouts that will shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All pressure vessels and the compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. System has Emergency Pressure Control System (EPCS) composed of solenoid valve  and pressure sensors acting as automatic cross-over valve that relieves the excess pressure from high side to low side and shuts down the compressors. All low side vessels that are connected directly to the suction of compressor is installed with high level float switches that shuts down compressor upon detection of high liquid level in the vessel. All cold storage rooms with ammonia evaporators and the refrigeration machinery room are installed with ammonia sensors that triggers an alarm upon detection of ammonia vapor in the vicinity of the sensor. Exhaust fans are activated in the engine room and refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temp or ammonia detection.\r\n\r\nRefrigeration drawings are located in RMP Binder Chapter 8 - Appendix 8.1-Refrigeration System Drawings.

In general, the process chemistry for each system is described in RMP Binder Chapter 8-Appendix 8.3.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See RMP Binder Chapter 8-Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nFC Tracy Holdings maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see RMP Binder Chapter 16-Incident Investigation.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the refrigeration machinery room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms with ammonia evaporators and the refrigeration machinery room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nFC Tracy Holdings is a new facility. There is no accident history.\r\n\r\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nIn the event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in RMP Binder Chapter 20.\r\n\r\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, priority level and implementation deadlines are also recommended.\r\n\r\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."
