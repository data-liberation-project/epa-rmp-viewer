While our principal business is the production of bulk Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), the facility also produces sodium lasalocid, (the active ingredient in a line of animal feed additives), as well as finished forms of Vitamins A, D3, E, B1, B2, B6, B12, biotin and beta-carotene.\n\nThe facility  was established on a 500 acre site bordering the Delaware River in rural Warren County in the late 1960\u0012s. Today Roche Belvidere includes over 50 buildings, which includes four major production operations and a complete utility systems infrastructure, including co-generation of electricity and steam and onsite water and wastewater treatment facilities.\n\nRight from the very beginning safety and environmental stewardship has been a \u0013matter of course\u0014. Protecting people and the environment is a serious business at Roche Belvidere. Roche has reduced emissions to the environment by 90% through continuous improvement of our operations and a capital investment of several millions of dollars. These improvements have been recognized by both local and federal regulatory agencies. Roche is proud of these accomplishments. This site has PSM covered processes. We follow OSHA, EPA/NJDEP and Roche Corporate Safety, Environmental and Industrial Hygiene Standards, Guidelines and Directive. Senior Management at the site, through a site Leadership Team that includes all operating units and support functions ensures that these initiatives are visible and implemented throughout the site.\n\nChlorine is one of two RMP regulated chemicals on the plant site. The other one is chloroform. The Worst Case Scenario modeling for chlorine produces the largest impact area of the two chemicals we use at the plant site. Roche uses chlorine to purify process, potable and waste water. It is not used in the production of our products. Chlorine has a sharp, disagreeable o"

High concentrations could cause more serious problems, such as convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, and, in extreme cases, death. Contact of the eyes and skin with liquid chlorine is serious requiring prompt medical attention.\n\nChloroform is a building block used in the production of other products. It is ranked among the top 50 chemicals with the highest production volumes in the US. We use chloroform as a media in the rearrangement process. Chloroform is a colorless liquid with a strong odor. The vapor can be extremely irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages when inhaled. This irritation warns us to avoid it before we encounter higher concentrations. It also causes headaches. High concentrations could cause more serious problems, such as difficult and painful breathing and, in extreme cases, death. For repeated exposures, other potential health effects may occur. Employees or contractors who work around chloroform take the following extra precautions:  Wearing appropriate safety equipment and undergoing special OSHA training to ensure safe handling of the product.\n\nRoche Vitamins Inc. (Roche) uses a variety of safety equipment and procedures to prevent accidental releases of chlorine. The Chlorine Institute produces standards for safety regarding the production and handling of chlorine. Roche follows these standards. Relief valves handle unexpected rises in temperature or pressure. Safety controls, including warning alarms and leak detectors and employee monitoring provide multiple lines of defense. Frequent monitoring of  pressure in vessels and piping prevents problems.  An extensive preventative maintenance program and monthly equipment inspections ensure proper operation.

Passive mitigation considered in this release scenario is  a concrete dike (secondary containment) large enough to contain the entire contents of the tank.\n\nFor chloroform, there are no offsite consequences for any alternative release scenarios. Therefore, no alternate case is presented.\n\nThe following is a five year history of reportable incidents. There were no incidents involving chlorine or chloroform which impacted the community or the environment during this time frame. \n\nTo be prepared for potential chemical accidents, Roche communicates regularly and works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) and local community responders.
