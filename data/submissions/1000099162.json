Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWe at Sysco Pittsburgh are committed to the safety of our employees, the public and protection of the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Should a release occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We also work closely in planning with the Harmony Fire Department and other local response agencies.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nSysco Pittsburgh utilizes a state-of-the art anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at Sysco Pittsburgh. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia that is expected to be present in this system is 20,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.
