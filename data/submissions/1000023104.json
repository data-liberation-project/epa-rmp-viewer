These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nWawona Packing Company LLC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWawona Packing Company LLC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. Any incidents that release a reportable amount of Ammonia require updating the 5 year Accident History and filing a revised RMP with the EPA.\n\nEmployee Participation\nWawona Packing Company LLC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n \nHot Work Permit\nAt Wawona Packing Company LLC Hot Work Permit procedures are in place and enforced.

Wawona Packing Company LLC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\nWawona Packing Company LLC has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to a catastrophic reciprocating compressor component failure a reportable release occured in 2010. Any reportable release requires updating the Accident History within 6 months.\n\n6.Emergency Action Plan\nWawona Packing Company LLC has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes defensive emergency actions including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency equipment it's regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is regularly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Any changes in Emergency Contact information is reported within 30 days.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.

Wawona Packing Company LLC Main Facility at 12133 Ave. 408 Ave in Cutler California has 3 independent refrigeration systems with anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. This is Update is to comply with the 5 year update requirents. Most sections were updated in 2010 in conjunction with an incident investigation for a reportable release.\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Wawona Packing Company LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around processing and storage of tree fruit.  This activity is consistent with SIC 0723/ NAICS 115114 post harvest crop activities. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system. Only one of the systems has an estimated inventory more than 10,000 lbs., and two are slightly less than 10,000 lbs.. We have developed and implemented a program level 3 based on anhydrous ammonia > 10,000 lbs. at the facility for all processes. \n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.

According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  To perform the required offsite consequence analyses for other substances we have used.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking.\n\nAlternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. It was revised to reflect the recent reportable release scenario. There was no change in the distance to toxic endpoint.\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Mechanical Code. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWawona Packing Company LLC maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated wit"
