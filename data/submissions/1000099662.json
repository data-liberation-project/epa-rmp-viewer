We have developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with the regulations stipulated by Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 296-67. The PSM program includes elements to help prevent accidental ammonia releases. UniSea has implemented a hazardous materials management plan and coordinated with the Redmond Fire Department to ensure prompt and coordinated emergency response in the unlikely event of an ammonia leak.    \n\n\n\n1.2 Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\n\n\nUniSea processes, packs, and stores seafood. Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of foods, and UniSea uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. Access to the facility is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nUniSea's written PSM plan addresses system design requirements, process hazard analysis (PHA), written operating procedures, operator training, contractor management, pre-startup safety review, systematic inspection and maintenance, safe work practices, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning, and periodic audits. This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every three years, and updated as necessary by UniSea.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating the refrigeration system understands the refrigeration process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only qualified personnel operate and maintain the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the UniSea facility in the past five years. \n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Planning and Response\n\n\n\nUniSea has a written hazardous materials management plan to ensu"

The plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties, such as the Redmond Fire Department. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at UniSea and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, UniSea has trained personnel to immediately respond and notify the Redmond Fire Department. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release.\n\n\n\nAll UniSea personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\n\n\nThis plan shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nUniSea conducts periodic inspections as part of the preventative maintenance program. If necessary, repairs are scheduled promptly and tracked by the maintenance department. Upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will comply with codes and standards applicable at that time.\n\n\n\nUniSea completed a PHA in 2017 and is scheduled to update the PHA in 2022. UniSea completed a compliance audit in 2021. UniSea will track assigned target dates and the completion status of PHA and compliance audit recommendations to ensure items are addressed promptly.\n\n"
