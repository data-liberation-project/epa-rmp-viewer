      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n11496 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\nLouisiana Pigment Company, L.P. (Louisiana Pigment) is one of the world\u00bfs newest titanium dioxide manufacturing plants, beginning production in April 1992.  The facility, located near Lake Charles, Louisiana, is comprised of a 40-acre \u00bfstate-of-the-art\u00bf plant site with an additional 100 plus acres used for parking, administrative offices, training area, and an industrial waste landfill.\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nLouisiana Pigment is dedicated to operating a manufacturing facility that maintains a strong respect for our environment and a safe work place for all employees.  Louisiana Pigment takes great pride in our efforts to continuously evaluate the operation of our process, equipment function and efficiency, and procedures, both management and process, to find ways of improving our ability to prevent accidents from occurring and to minimize the impact if the worst occurs.  \n\nProcedures have been developed to enhance our ability to evaluate events that have a potential for unfavorable results.  Computer tracking databases have been purchased and developed that provide management; an overall view of the process and maintenance activities.  Management has required the initiation of an internal auditing system that reports any non-conformance issues for immediate action. \n\nChemical Manufacture Process \n\nProduct Utilization\n\nLouisiana Pigment manufactures in excess of 100,000 metric tons per year of titanium dioxide by utilizing the chloride process.  Titanium dioxide is used in industry for generating brilliantly hued paints, in the manufacturing of primers and base coats, in automotive finishes, and in coatings for the exterior of buildings.  Beyond this, titanium dioxide can be found in materials such as high-quality papers, color plastics, furniture panels, textile fibers, glass, ink, porcelain, toothpaste, cosmetics, candy, food coloring, PVC, white sidewall tires, and a g"

Titanium dioxide also improves the physical properties of many plastics.  It absorbs ultraviolet light, making the material more resistant to weathering.\n\nManufacturing Process\n\nThe chloride process at Louisiana Pigment uses high-grade titanium ores (natural rutile, titanium ores, or synthetic rutile) to recover titanium dioxide (TiO2).  This is done by first producing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as an intermediate product, then oxidizing it to form TiO2 particles to the purity required for further processing and finishing treatment.\n\nThe two steps that most characterize the Chloride Process are the continuous chlorination of ore in a fluidized bed chlorinator and the continuous oxidation of titanium tetrachloride in the gas phase to titanium dioxide using a burner.  These two steps are completely dependent upon each other since the chlorine released by oxidation is recycled to the chlorinator.  Through the use of analytical measurement and computer control technology, it is possible to optimize essential production variables, reduce down time to a minimum, and operate machinery at maximum safety standards.  On the premise that operating conditions are kept at an optimum for every step of the chloride process, 90-95% of the titanium dioxide contained in the original ore can be recovered and used in the end product.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 added Section 112(r) to the CAA, which mandated the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a regulatory program to prevent serious chemical accidents that may potentially affect public health and the environment.  The resulting regulations referred to as EPA\u00bfs Accident Prevention Program (Risk Management Planning), required certain companies, municipalities, and ind"

The program starts with sound incident investigation procedures that utilize root cause analysis to define and correct the direct and indirect causes of incidents or events that could have had a strong potential for an incident.  Furthermore, Louisiana Pigment has increased emphasis on employee participation in improving the safety of our employees, resident and non-resident contractors.  The current Safety Program includes elements such as performing Job Task Observations to review an employee\u00bfs performance of a specific task, and review of written procedures for accuracy and inclusion of required safety precautions. \n\nLouisiana Pigment\u00bfs Risk Management Program is complemented by workplace health and safety programs as well as waste and release reduction programs, which address and minimize releases, review and implement projects or raw material changes to reduce emissions, and decrease the generation of waste.  All of these programs, combined with our commitment to our employees and our community, provide a strong system to minimize the potential for chemical accidents that would have a detrimental impact.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nSince January 1999, Louisiana Pigment has incurred only three incidents involving titanium tetrachloride, which are included in the five-year accident history.  On June 9, 1999, an estimated 2204 pounds of titanium tetrachloride was release.  A shelter-in-place for the area was issued for less than one hour.  On June 15, 1999, an injury occurred when a small amount of titanium tetrachloride was released in the unit during maintenance activities.  The third incident occurred on August 30, 2002, when a shelter-in-place was requested for an area south of the plant during a release of an estimated 62.2 pounds of titanium tetrachloride from a hole that developed in a process vessel.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAt Louisiana Pigment we work hard to en"
