Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies [?2745.3(a)]\n\n\n\nThe CMWD's LBWFP is located at 2100 Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks, California 91360.  This facility includes the Treatment Plant, eight million gallons of storage in the clearwell, a 10,000 acre ft. water storage reservoir and chemical storage.  This plant uses ozone, chlorine and ammonia to disinfectant the water from Lake Bard to meet regulatory standards prior to distribution.  Chlorine is stored in a scrubber protected; cement block building located below the treatment plant at Lat 34.24559 degrees (North) and Long -118.83090 degree (West).  \n\n\n\nThe CMWD Board of Directors, management and all employees are committed to the safe operation of the LBWFP. This commitment is reflected in the design, operation, maintenance, and procedures used to operate the plant. CMWD has used chlorine gas safely at this facility since it was constructed in1964 and aqueous ammonia safely since 1995.  The focus of CMWD policies are to operate and maintain the chlorine disinfection system of the LBWFP in such a way as to protect CMWD employees, the surrounding communities and the environment from a chlorine or ammonia leak.  The policies incorporate the highest level of commitment to establishing safety by insuring multiple, redundant and parallel layers of safety.  The equipment is engineered for safety, procedures are developed for safe operation, safety is incorporated into training, employees are provided personal protective equipment, and emergency response procedures are coordinated with the local responding agencies. \n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances [?2745.3(b)]\n\n\n\nCMWD uses and stores chlorine.  Chlorine is the only federally regulated substance at the facility.  Since the amount of chlorine stored on site exceeds 10,000 pounds, the facility is required to prepare a Risk Management Plan per state and federal regulations.  The maximum quantity stored on site"

      "SummaryText": " is 40,000 lbs.  The chlorine gas is stored and used directly from Department of Transportation certified one (1)-ton containers.\n\n\n\nCMWD also uses and stores 19% aqueous ammonia.  Aqueous ammonia is regulated by the State of California at quantities greater than 500 gallons and requires the development of a Risk Management Plan.  The maximum quantity capable of being stored on site is 4,500 gallons.  However, the quantity normally stored on site seldom exceeds 4,000 gallons.   The aqueous ammonia is delivered to the site in certified chemical delivery trucks and is injected into the water directly from the 4,500 gallon storage tank.\n\n\n\na)    Chlorine worst case and alternative case scenario analysis \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario involves the release, within ten minutes, of one container containing 2000 lbs. of chlorine gas, liquefied under pressure.  This scenario assumes that the release occurs inside the concrete storage building without mitigation by the scrubber. Based upon this worst case scenario the area of toxic concern would extend out from the storage building and impact the surrounding communities within 2.3 miles of the LBWFP.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a more realistic release mitigated by physical and mechanical means.  This scenario assumes a pigtail failure with activation of the automated Halogen valve shut-off system.  Under this scenario, the area of toxic concern would be limited to 87 yards and would not impact the surrounding communities.\n\n\n\nb)    Aqueous ammonia worst case and alternative scenario analysis\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario involves the release, within ten minutes, of a tank containing 4,500 gallons of 19% aqueous ammonia, at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. This scenario assumes that the release is contained in the secondary containment area without mitigation.  Based upon this worst case scenario the area of toxic concern would extend out from the storage area 0.14 miles.  This release extends slightly beyo"

However, the area of toxic concern would primarily impact the uninhabited open space surrounding the District property and would not impact the surrounding communities.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from a cracked two inch pipe. This scenario assumes a full 4,500 gallon tank is released without mitigation into the secondary containment area.  The area of toxic concern in this scenario would extend 0.07 miles from the storage area.\n\n\n\n3.     Administrative control and mitigation measures\n\n\n\nCMWD Staff, in conjunction with design engineers have developed a series of operational, and maintenance checklists and procedures.  These procedures insure the proper operation of the disinfection system.  These procedures insure that the equipment is calibrated, inspected and maintained at a level of safe operational efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe system is designed to prevent the release of chlorine and ammonia by including layers of safety.  The chlorine is stored in a concrete block building, located away from and remotely monitored by the 24-hour operations center.  The chlorine storage building has automated valves that will close if a chlorine leak is detected.  The building has a scrubber incorporated into the design of the building. The scrubber is designed to absorb and neutralize approximately one full container of chlorine gas.   Distribution of the chlorine gas outside of the scrubber protected building is through buried vacuum pipelines designed to stop the flow of gas if a break occurs in any pipe.  Any break in the distribution piping will break the vacuum distribution system and stop the flow of chlorine gas.  A break in the vacuum distribution system will cause an alarm to be sent to the on-duty operator who will immediately investigate the situation and insure that a release does not occur.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia portion of the disinfection system includes the s"

The aqueous ammonia tank is located outside of the chemical building.  The storage location provides secondary containment for the aqueous ammonia.  The piping connecting the stored aqueous ammonia to the injection point is contained in underground concrete trenches and concrete structures.  This prevents a break in the delivery piping from releasing the chemical into the environment.  The ammonia injection point is located at the south end of the clearwell gallery.\n\n\n\n4.    Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps [?2745.3(c)]\n\n\n\nThe prevention program includes a full range of preparation and chemical specific measures available to prevent and prepare for an incident.  All information concerning the disinfection process and the detailed engineering design information has been consolidated and is available at the facility.  An independent engineering consultant completed the process hazard analysis.  They have reported that, \"The facility was found to be well designed with many safety systems in place to prevent and/or mitigate potential chlorine releases.\"    \n\n\n\n5.    5-Year Accident History [?2745.3(d)]\n\n\n\nSince 1964, CMWD has used chlorine gas as a disinfectant for the water treatment process.  In 1995, CMWD began using aqueous ammonia to create chloramines used in the disinfection process.  CMWD has never had an accident having offsite consequences and within the last five years has not had an accident involving chlorine gas or ammonia at this facility.\n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program [?2745.3(e)]\n\n\n\nCMWD has a very active emergency response program.  The facility actively participates with the local Hazardous Materials Response Teams to prepare for emergencies at the facility and provide resources for emergency responses throughout the county.
