Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information developed through implementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors - TVA develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and operate generation facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, TVA evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including their safety performance.  Procedures are in place to ensure that contractors are properly informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process involved, including the emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nV.

Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response plan requirements including adequate first aid and medical treatment, safe shelter-in-place locations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency response plan.  In addition, periodic emergency response drills are conducted to keep employees, contractors, and local responders familiar with the plan."
