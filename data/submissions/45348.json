      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nGolden Road Water Treatment Plant lies inside the city limits with boundaries delineated by a chain link fence.  The site has appropriate buffers from residential areas.  The Golden Road Water Treatment Plant remains an essential facility for the City of Tyler.  The plant treats and pumps approximately 80% - 90% of the city's potable water.  This treatment plant is the primary source of drinking water for the City of Tyler's estimated 100,000 residents.\n\n     Water treatment is the regulated process at this facility.  Chlorine gas disinfects the water making it safe for public consumption.  Chlorine gas for disinfection in water treatment results in one of the most cost-effective methods for meeting state and federal disinfecting rules and regulations.  The plant safely stores 36,000 pounds of chlorine.  In addition, the plants stores approximately 9,340 pounds of ammonia.\n\n     The Golden Road plant manger drafted the written operating procedures around safety.  In addition, all operators must have a surface water operator's license from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  All employees who handle chlorine and ammonia know about the dangers of the two chemicals and how to safely handle the gases.  The plant manager has safety meetings on a regular basis.  At these meetings overall plant safety is discussed with employees.  Employees can voice their opinions on how to improve plant and chemical safety.\n\nThe Golden Road Water Treatment Plant complies with the rules and regulations of the EPA RMP.  The most important preventative measure for avoiding accidental release involves the gas feed systems.  Due to the design of the chlorine process, the gas will cease to flow when a gas piping breaks.  This ensures that any failure in the process equipment will cease gas flow which helps to eliminate the chances of a chlorine or ammonia release.  A building with proper ventilation and fire resistant walls encloses the process area.  In addition"

      "SummaryText": ", gas detectors in the process area will alarm personnel that a leak has occurred.  Also as of 2004, a scrubber for the chlorine process was installed at the facility.\n\n     All operators are trained in the written operating procedures.  Preventative maintenance procedures aid in changing out wearable parts before they fail.  For example, pigtails are changed out annually or at any sign of deterioration and all gaskets are replaced after any servicing.  Inspections of the storage area and process area help to ensure that all valves and components are quite capable of proper shut down to isolate and stop leaks.  Any valve that turns with difficulty gets replaced.  In addition the SCBA's are tested on a routine basis for proper functioning.\n\n     The City of Tyler Golden Road Water Treatment Plant has not had any accidental releases within the last five years that resulted in personal injury or property damage offsite or onsite.  This is due to an exceptional training program and the overall design of the feed systems.\n\n     Under the City of Tyler Emergency Management Plan, response procedures exist where by emergency evacuation measures will be implemented as required.  Any incidence of toxic or hazardous chemical leak or spill subject to off-site contamination will result in a 911 call by Department personnel requesting Tyler's HAZMAT Team respond to the emergency.  Tyler Water Utilities complies with Federal and State HAZCOM reporting requirements, thus all chemical quantities and storage locations are on file with the Tyler Fire Department and Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (LEPC).  Tyler's HAZMAT possesses mobile communication capabilities enabling them to access the LEPC's CAMEO software (located at the County Fire Marshall's Office in the Smith county Office Building). Thus, the evacuation area is clearly defined and City of Tyler Emergency Response personnel will implement evacuation procedures in accordance with the Emergency Management Plan.  The St"

      "SummaryText": "ate Emergency Response Commission has approved the emergency management Plan.  In addition the same firm which has prepared this report was also hired by the City of Tyler to perform the mandated vulnerability assessment.  All of the findings were reported to and communicated with the City of Tyler and the Smith County emergency response plan.\n\n     The Golden Road Water Treatment Plant has improved safety and offsite impacts with improved mitigation.  As of November 2004, the chlorine cylinder storage area is now totally enclosed in a building.  This building was designed to meet all current rules, codes, and regulations. Also, due to the close proximity to residential housing and parks, the City of Tyler has spent the money to include a chlorine gas scrubber in this building.  The scrubber will remove the gas from the air thereby not allowing any chlorine gas with toxic concentrations to escape into the surrounding environment.  In addition, the feed system has been designed with an automatic chlorine gas shutoff system.  If the process area detectors detect a certain concentration of chlorine, a signal will be sent to actuate the valves on the one ton cylinders and automatically turn them off.  This offers a redundancy of safety features to protect the citizens of Tyler, Texas.  Plant personnel involved in the chlorine disinfection aspect of the plant shall be thoroughly trained in the use and inspection of this equipment."
