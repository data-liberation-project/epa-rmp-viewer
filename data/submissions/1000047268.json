The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\r\n\r\n- Increasing the maximum on-site inventory for Isopentane (Process 3) based on the number of Isopentane rail cars that can be simultaneously held on Stolthaven Houston's rail car storage tracks.\r\n\r\n- Deleting n-Pentane (previous Process 2) and Pentane Blend (previous Process 4) Intermodal Transfers from Stolthaven Houston's RMP.  These operations will no longer occur at the facility according to current customer requirements.\r\n\r\n- Updating the RMP based on Stolthaven Houston's five-year Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation, which commenced in October of 2014.\r\n\r\n- Minor RMP data element updates based on recent revisions to Stolthaven Houston's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and our Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) found in the terminal's Local Training Manual (LTM), and \r\n\r\n- Updating the contact information for the new Terminal Manager responsible for RMP implementation at Stolthaven Houston Inc.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a7 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes related to bulk chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.

As a result of this third-party audit, a RMP/PSM Team was formed to address the audit findings.  This team is currently performing a comprehensive review and revision of Stolthaven Houston's RMP/PSM program to better align the program with our current work practices.  As part of this comprehensive internal review, individuals at the facility have been assigned to each of the specific RMP/PSM program elements to promote responsibility and ownership. \r\n\r\n- In 2014 a new role, Emergency Response Coordinator, was created and filled to the streamline the terminal's efforts in the event of a significant incident at the facility.\r\n\r\n- Stolthaven Houston contracted with a safety consulting firm to facilitate the five-year Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation of the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.

Stolthaven Houston Inc. currently has over 18-years of experience in the storage and handling of TDI. \r\n\r\nAs part of the recent changes associated with additional TDI storage in Low-Pressure Storage Tank D-15-19, significant modifications were performed such that TDI is handled safely and efficiently in this tank, including installing a liner on the storage tank's floor and shell, installing a new line constructed of 316L stainless steel from the storage tank to the existing marine dock line in D-Manifold that is used exclusively for TDI marine-based transfers, replacing all existing gate valves on the Tank D-15-19 system with new ball valves for ease of operation, installing a new stainless-steel pump for TDI at Storage Tank D-15-19, installing new hot water external heating panels, a water tank, and associated heating panel supply/return lines for Storage Tank D-15-19 while in TDI service, insulating Tank D-15-19, installing internal eductors at the tank's recirculation line to improve product mixing, installing electric tracing and insulation on the tank's lateral line t"

On the evening of August 23, 2013 nitrogen pressure was being used to unload a rail car containing TDI into one of Stolthaven Houston's on-site TDI storage tanks.  As the rail car was being unloaded, the rail switching crew on-duty coupled the terminal's locomotive to a string of rail cars, including the working TDI rail car, and began to pull the cars away from the rail rack.  As the rail car being emptied of TDI was moved, the TDI cargo hose released from the car, and the car's 1-inch valve connected to the plant nitrogen hose was sheared off.  Residual nitrogen pressure in the rail car caused approximately 4,500-gallons of TDI to be released from the sheared 1-inch valve opening on the rail car into the Rail Rack R-2 concrete containment area, with a small amount of TDI released onto an in-plant concrete road adjacent to the rack in the center of the facility.  There was no off-site release of TDI liquid.  A Stolthaven Houston"

      "SummaryText": "operator on duty at Rail Rack R-2 immediately closed the rail rack TDI product line valve leading to the storage tank, and the TDI liquid release from the rail car stopped once the residual nitrogen pressure in the car reached atmospheric pressure.  A third party environmental response contractor was contacted within an hour of this release to assist with the necessary clean up efforts, which were completed on the late afternoon of August 27, 2013.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this incident, the following corrective actions were implemented by Stolthaven Houston Inc. after review by the terminal's Management Steering Committee:  (1) the TDI incident was discussed in detail at a mandatory meeting conducted at Rail Rack R-2 for all facility Operations, Waste Water, and Maintenance Department personnel, (2) Standard Operating Procedures related to rail car switching were formally updated on September 20, 2013, and (3) operator training related to the revised rail car switching and blue flag procedures was conducted during Operations Departmental meetings held according to shift in September of 2013.  \r\n\r\nNote that this incident did not result in any on-site deaths or injuries.  Similarly, there have been no accidental releases from any RMP covered processes in the past five years which resulted in known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nAll incidents at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal are formally investigated as part of our facility's ISO Quality Management System (QMS) to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the events, and to implement appropriate corrective actions for continuous process improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a7 68.155(e):  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

Vapors generated during these intermittent Isopentane transfer operations are directed to the terminal's Tank Farm Vent Flare for pollution control.  \r\n\r\nVINYL ACETATE MONOMER STORAGE AND TRANSFERS\r\n\r\nStorage Tank P-50-5 is an existing internal floating roof (IFR) tank at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with a maximum working capacity of approximately 50,142-barrels, which corresponds to a maximum VAM storage capacity of approximately 16,400,000-pounds.  Tank P-50-5, which represents the facility's worst-case release scenario, was placed into VAM service for the first time on February 25, 2010.  VAM is received into this tank via barge delivery using a dedicated marine dock line.  Product is stored and then shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.  VAM may also be transferred periodically directly from barges to rail tank cars with no intermediate product storage, and VAM slops can also be received from marine vessels berthed at Stolthaven Houston.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of the 2010 VAM storage project for Tank P-50-5, piping modifications were completed in various facility manifolds and at Tank P-50-5 to eliminate the use of hoses in VAM service to the greatest extent possible within the terminal.  A VAM filter-pot was also installed adjacent to the sto"

Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems in the immediate area of Tank P-50-5 were also upgraded to provide additional cooling water as-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving any of the the facility's flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks in close proximity.  Existing portable water delivery systems also remain available should they be needed in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nEmployee training related to the specifics of VAM storage and transfer at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was first conducted in December of 2008 and then again in April of 2009 in preparation of receiving this RMP regulated substance into the facility's A-Tank Farm in 2009.  Although current facility employees have been trained and are experienced in the procedures necessary to safely handle VAM, additional safety training related specifically to VAM storage in P-Tank Farm was conducted in December of 2009.  Specific topics covered during this employee review of safe VAM handling procedures included, but were not limited to, the following information:  product transfer modes and affected facility equipment, VAM technical and physical properties, inhibitor specifications and periodic verification, nitrogen blanketing to maintain low oxygen levels, special product hazards and warnings, required personal protective equipment (PPE), and environmental/regulatory considerations.
