If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire & rescue department and ECPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\nFacility Information\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application of fertilizer for crop production.\n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 156,000 pounds in our 2 18,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 156,000 pounds, which represents the volume of our storage tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario would be a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .41 miles.\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has been previously inspected several times by the State Fire Marshall and the deficiencies have been corrected and reinspected.  The local fire department and rescue members have toured the facility and have become familiar with the location of values and the hazard and safety of the system.\n     Management and key employees have attended NH3 safety school and other employees are trained as to the hazards, safety, and how the plant should be operated.\n\n\nThe Five-year Accident History\n\n     There have not "
