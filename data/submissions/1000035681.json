LyondellBasell Acetyls actively participates in the La Porte CitizenA\u00bfs Advisory Council and La Porte Local Emergency Planning Committee through funding and commitment of plant personnel time to these activities. LyondellBasell Acetyls has hosted plant tours for concerned citizens. The facility has an established, and tested, method for notifying our employees and surrounding community of an event which could, or would impact them. The complex has standard operating procedures in place which define responsibilities and reporting requirements, depending upon the nature of the emergency. The manufacturing complex has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to respond to fire, release of hazardous materials, medical and rescue emergencies. Additionally, the complex is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid organization and can call upon all of their expertise, manpower and equipment if needed. LyondellBasell Acetyls falls under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\nLyondellBasell Acetyls produces three final products at the La Porte facility: methanol, acetic acid, and Vinyl acetate monomer. Methanol is sold into the merchant market as well as being a feedstock for our production of acetic acid. Acetic acid is sold as an intermediate to customers who use it to manufacture other final products. Acetic acid is also used as a feedstock for the manufacture of Vinyl acetate monomer.  LyondellBasell Acetyls has two chemicals that fall under the RMP regulations. These are Vinyl acetate monomer and propane.  Vinyl acetate monomer is stored in a purpose-designed tank with a maximum capacity of 24,000,000 pounds. Propane resides in a closed loop refridgeration system with a maximum c"

The OCS evaluates both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternate release scenario (ARS). LyondellBasell Acetyls does not anticipate a WCS to occur, but has planned for and communicated the information concerning a WCS to the public. The ARS is a more realistic scenario. Alternate release scenarios are based upon a more likely set of circumstances.  \r\n\r\nThe WCS for a toxic material at our site is a failure of the Vinyl acetate monomer storage tank which allows the entire contents of the tank. This plume could impact offsite environmental receptors and the public. The WCS for flammable material at our site is the failure of a nozzel on the bottom of a storage tank.  This would allow the contents to excape to the atmosphere. This vapor cloud explosion could have offsite impact to public receptors, such as industrial areas.\r\n\r\nLyondellBasell Acetyls maintains an active accident prevention program consisting of many elements. The La Porte site falls under the Risk Management Program (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The La Porte facility has an in-depth training program for technicians. This program includes standard operating procedures, mentoring, on-the-job training, and testing. Our SOPs are reviewed annually by professional staff and technicians. LyondellBasell Acetyls utilizes contractors for plant maintenance and other projects. A qualification procedure has been established for these contractors which examine their safety records, procedures and training. All on-site contractors participate in the facility safety programs. LyondellBasell Acetyls maintains a Process Change Authorization (PCA) and Management of Change (MOC) process. Employees and contractors participate in both these programs. LyondellBasell A"

The site has a comprehensive work permit procedure covering all types of work including; hot work, confined space entry, cold work and excavation. LyondellBasell Acetyls uses third party auditing to verify safety, health, environmental and mechanical integrity throughout the facility. Additionally, the facility conducts weekly safety and housekeeping audits of all plant areas. Safety information is a priority communication to employees. \r\n\r\nLyondellBasell Acetyls La Porte facility has had one significant release of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (7699lbs)in the last five years.  This release did not result in any fatalities, injuries, or significant damage onsite or offsite.\r\n\r\nLyondellBasell Acetyls has a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the protection of employees, contractors, visitors, the public and environmental receptors. The ERP details how employees and contractors should report a variety of emergencies, including fire, hazardous materials release, medical and rescue situations.  Actions to be taken by all onsite personnel are detailed in the ERP. The La Porte Complex maintains an Emergency Response Team with personnel trained (to the applicable standard) to respond and actively mitigate in fire and hazardous materials emergencies. Additionally, the ERT has medical and rescue trained personnel for these situations. The complex is a member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which gives the facility access to all the manpower, expertise and equipment of the other 100+ members.
