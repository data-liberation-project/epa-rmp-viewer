              "Description": "The epichlorohydrin (\"epi\") system design is based on widely recognized industry best practices, codes and standards, a depth of knowledge of the hazards and properties of epi and a thorough process hazard analysis by a team including members with considerable experience with epi and its use in manufacturing surfactants.  The epichlorohydrin storage tank is built to code API 650 and is constructed of corrosion-resistant 316L stainless steel.  Piping is also constructed of 316L stainless steel.  Redundant liquid level measurement devices, a high level interlock and redundant alarms prevent accidental overfill.  A closed-loop vapor recovery system prevents the emission of epi vapor.  Nitrogen is used to inert the system and is monitored by a pressure transmitter and alarms.  Fail-closed valves connected to Emergency Stop pushbuttons can be used to remotely shut down and isolate the system.  An automatic heat-activated foam deluge system is employed to extinguish fires and can also be manually activated to blanket a spill with foam to prevent evaporation of toxic vapors.\n\n\n\nColonial uses management of change, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, employee participation and training, and detailed safe operating procedures to maintain an effective prevention program.  A detailed emergency response plan provides scenario-specific procedures for personnel to follow to minimize and mitigate the consequences of an accidental release of epichlorohydrin. Colonial has never had an accidental release of epichlorohydrin, but has procedures for timely and effective incident investigation should a near-miss or accident occur involving the epichlorohydrin system.",

      "SummaryText": "Colonial Chemical Inc. located in rural Marion County, TN is a leader in the manufacture of surfactant products based on renewable ingredients.  Colonial is committed to manufacturing safe products and to protecting the safety of its employees and the community. Colonial receives epichlorohydrin, derived from plant-based glycerol, in bulk containers.  The epichlorohydrin is transferred from the bulk container to a closed atmospheric storage tank incorporating a full vapor recovery design to prevent the release of vapors.  Safety systems for epichlorohydrin include multiple layers of overfill and overpressure prevention, nitrogen inertion, remote emergency shutdown and isolation devices, interlocks/alarms, spill containment structures and an automatic foam deluge system.  Spills of epichlorohydrin can be isolated remotely and blanketed with aqueous fire-fighting foam to suppress the evaporation of toxic vapors and prevent fire.  The storage of bulk epichlorohydrin is in a dedicated containment dike remote from the manufacturing area. Piping containing epichlorohydrin is 100% within impervious containment.  \n\n\n\nOff-site consequence analysis for the hypothetical worst-case scenario involving epichlorohydrin indicates that the potential effects are limited to a small localized rural area adjacent to the Colonial facility.  Analysis of more realistic scenarios involving failure of unloading or transfer equipment shows that no hazardous exposure is expected outside of the Colonial facility. \n\n\n\nThe robust design and safety features in the epichlorohydrin system, resulting from thorough process hazard analysis and application of industry best practices, along with well-trained and engaged employees has resulted in the safe operation of the process with no accidental releases of epichlorohydrin since startup in 2015.
