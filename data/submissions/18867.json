The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (CSDLAC) Joint Water Pollution Control Plant (JWPCP) uses chlorine for disinfecting wastewater to provide safe effluent discharges to the environment.  Digester gas, on the other hand, is one of the by-products of the sludge digestion process at wastewater treatment plants.  Digester gas is used as an energy resource at JWPCP, instead of flaring it as a waste gas as would be done at a number of wastewater treatment plants.  JWPCP's chlorine and digester gas processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility.  This includes a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions that must be taken by the facility in the event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nGeneral facility and regulated substances information.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis results.\n\nSummary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nFive-year accident history summary.\n\nEmergency response program summary.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the JWPCP Chlorine and Digester Gas Systems are provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe JWPCP accidental release prevention policy involves an integrated approach that provides proven technology, staff training in operation and maintenance practices, and tested and proven management system practices.

The EAP also provides information on escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments.  JWPCP EAP was prepared for the chlorine and digester gas systems to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Joint Water Pollution Control Plant treatment facilities are located on a land area of approximately 215 acres within the City of Carson.  The property is bounded by the Harbor (110) Freeway on the west, Sepulveda Boulevard on the North, Main Street on the east and Lomita Boulevard on the south. The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County has operated the JWPCP facility since 1928.  The JWPCP serves a population of about 3.5 million people and many industries in southern and eastern Los Angeles County, providing advanced primary and partial secondary treatment for a design flow of 385 million gallons of wastewater per day. \n\nThe purpose of the chlorine system is to provide disinfection to the primary and secondary effluent.  The disinfecting medium is calcium hypochlorite, which is obtained by on-line reaction of chlorine with lime slurry.   The chlorine system consists of the railcar chlorination system, chlorine containment and treatment system, auxiliary systems, including instrument air, pad air, chlorine leak detection, caustic absorption, and a caustic scrubber.  Liquid chlorine is delivered to the chlorine station by railcars.  Six double-walled and insulated tank cars of 90-ton chlorine capacity are usually present on two rail spurs with two cars piped and one actually delivering chlorine.\n\nDry compressed air is supplied to the railcar being unloaded at 175 psig to provide pressure to m"

A flexible monel hose connects the railcar to a 3-ft deep pipe gallery that is located directly underneath the three unloading stations.  Three expansion vessels are provided; they protect the liquid chlorine piping from rupture because of pressure buildup from liquid chlorine being trapped between two closed valves and absorbing ambient heat.\n\nChlorine flows into the pipe gallery to the Injection Room, where liquid chlorine and lime slurry are injected into a process line with water acting as a transport medium.  Two chlorine sensors in this room provide leak detection, warning, and scrubber activation.  An automatic caustic scrubber system provides containment and neutralization of possible chlorine releases in the Injection Room by sealing off external ventilation and recirculating the chlorine-contaminated air through a caustic scrubbing tank and venturi.\n\nIn case of a major chlorine leak, the chlorine railcar can be isolated by emergency shutoff valves that are located on the piping downstream of the railcar manway.  There are emergency shutoff switches (push buttons) located at the unloading rack and at chlorine control room.  The emergency shutoff switches are also activated by the plant computer control system.\n\nThe full containment building and caustic scrubber system is able to neutralize the release of 90 tons (one railcar load) of chlorine.  Upon detection of chlorine gas by containment building chlorine detectors, the scrubber system is activated; chlorine leaking into the containment building is ducted into a venturi and packed tower scrubber, and neutralized with recirculating caustic solution.  The scrubber system is a once-through design; the maximum design discharge chlorine concentrations from the scrubber stack would be 5 parts per million by volume (ppmv).\n\nGas analyzers are used to sense a chlorine gas leak in the railcar storage room.

If the selected duty recirculation pump fails to start, the standby recirculation pump starts automatically and an alarm is annunciated at the control panel.  A chlorine analyzer is also used to determine the chlorine concentration in the scrubber exhaust.  The scrubber system is also equipped with an emergency generator set.  After the loss of regular power the emergency generator will automatically start and will continue to run for 5 minutes after regular power is restored.  The emergency generator powers the Containment Building and Injection Room scrubbing systems including local alarms, the scrubber fan, recirculation pumps, electrically operated valves, and the Bailey computer.\n\nThe purpose of the digester gas system is to use the digester gas produced at the JWPCP as an energy resource, instead of flaring it as a waste gas.  The sludge collected from the primary and secondary settling tanks is pumped into sealed digesters and heated, by steam, to approximately 96 degrees F to encourage growth of mesophilic anaerobic bacteria.  The bacteria consume as well as stabilize the sludge and in the process produce digester gas that is approximately 65 percent methane and 35 percent carbon dioxide.  The digester gas collects in the headspace of the digester and flows via pipelines to the following pieces of equipment for combustion: (1) gas turbines, (2) boilers, (3) IC engines, and (4) flares.\n\nThe digester gas system consists of 24 rectangular and 17 circular anaerobic digesters, gas distribution system, compressors, and flares.

Both the circular and rectangular digesters are identical in process, operation, and control strategy.\n\nAccess to the JWPCP facility is through gates, which are closed after regular hours.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario.\"  The first scenario for toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10- minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  For the flammable substances, the worst-case release scenario is also defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel vaporizes resulting in a vapor cloud explosion\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"\n\nChlorination System\n\nRMP and CalARP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes.  For the worst-case release scenario analysis for the JWPCP, one scenario was considered.  Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under this scenario to reduce offsite impacts.

The release rate reduction from the enclosed building is estimated to be approximately 87 percent of the release rate from the railcar, per guidance from EPA regarding control efficiencies levels for buildings storing chlorine.  The release rate for chlorine was thus estimated to be 2,304 pounds per minute.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of bulk storage tanks would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (111 degrees F), and average relative humidity (66 percent) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the air dispersion modeling indicate that this scenario will result in offsite impacts.\n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.

A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no such chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the JWPCP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the Process Hazard Analysis, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \n\nSince chlorine is the only regulated toxic substance used at the facility, only one alternative scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nThe scenario selected for the JWPCP chlorination facility involves the release of chlorine from the monel flexible hose that connects the railcar to the chlorination process.  This scenario can occur if a flex hose is used, that is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine from the railcar.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (1-inch diameter) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16 inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine leak by the chlorine detectors installed at the chlorination facility.  Therefore, when the operators receive a leak alarm, they must assume that it is not a false alarm when responding.  Response procedures call for three people to investigate the leak.  It is assumed that a maximum of 60 minutes would be required for operators to respond, determine that the leak was real, locate the source and respond by activating the remote controlled shutoff valves that are installed on the flex hoses.

However, the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.01 lb/min. Since the chlorine release from the scrubber stacks would be neutrally buoyant, EPA's SCREEN3 model was used for the air dispersion analysis.  The meteorological conditions used for the alternative release scenario analysis were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 61 degrees F, and average humidity of 66 percent.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the maximum ground level one hour average concentration for chlorine would be less than 0.1 ppm (0.02 ppm). This concentration is significantly lower than 3 ppm, the toxic endpoint, and will have no offsite impacts.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of this scenario is highly unlikely, because the flex hoses are carefully inspected during each connection/disconnection operation, and during operator rounds.

A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion was used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.
