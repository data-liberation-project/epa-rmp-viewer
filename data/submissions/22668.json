      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention\n\nLindberg Heat Treating Company's overall intent is to minimize, where possible, the storage and use of highly hazardous chemicals in our heat treating facilities.  When highly hazardous chemicals are required to properly perform our heat treat processes, facility management is expected to ensure the safety of Lindberg associates and protection of the environment. All managers must comply with Lindberg Corporation's Policy on Environmental Issues.\n\nFacility and Substances Handled\n\nLindberg Heat treating Company operates a 83,400 square foot facility that provides heat treating services to the metal working markets throughout central Michigan. The facility uses ammonia in gaseous form along with hydrocarbon gases to create a hard, wear resistant surface on steel parts. Processes that require the use of ammonia are carbonitriding and nitro-carburizing. Ammonia is used to supply nitrogen in a form readily absorbed by steel surfaces. Commercially available nitrogen cannot be readily absorbed by steel and therefore is not a less hazardous substitute. The ammonia is stored in a pressurized 40,000-pound above ground storge tank in liquid form. Vaporized ammonia is drawn off the tank and delivered to the heat treat process via a piping system.  The supplier fills the ammonia tank approximately once per month.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nFor Lindberg Heat Treating, the worst-case release scenario involves the release of the entire contents (40,000 pounds) of the anhydrous ammonia tank within a ten-minute period. The RMP-Comp program (version 1.06) was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia. This estimated distance to endpoint was 2.3 miles based on the mandated assumptions of a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec and an atmospheric stability class of F.\n\nBased on 1990 census data obtained from the U.S. Census web site, the estimated residential population located within a distance of 2.3 miles from the facility is 55,000. \n\nT"

      "SummaryText": "o minimize the potential that this worst-case release would occur, Lindberg Heat Treating stores the anhydrous ammonia in a ASME pressure vessel designed for a maximum pressure of 250 psia. The ammonia is stored at a maximum pressure of 140 psia. This tank is regularly inspected as part of the facilities accident prevention program.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nDuring the past five years, the facility has not had a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia. Due to the lack of a spill history, Lindberg selected a pipeline leak as the most realistic significant spill scenario for its facility. This scenario is based on the complete rupture of a 2\" pipeline. Lindberg estimates that the valves needed to stop the flow from the tank would be closed within a maximum of ten minutes. \n\nWith these assumptions, and using the OCA Guidance, Chapter 7, Formula 7-1, the estimated ammonia release rate during this scenario is approximately 369 pounds per minute. The RMP-Comp program (version 1.06) was used to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoint for this release rate and duration. This estimated distance to endpoint was 0.2 miles based on the mandated assumptions of a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec and an atmospheric stability class of D.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility maintains compliance with OSHA standard 1910.119, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\". Also the supplier of the chemical, LaRoche Industries, has supplied the facility with recommended practices for the storage and handling of ammonia. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has never had a reportable release or accident.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, personnel are expected to evacuate the facility and meet at a\ndesignated area outside the facility. The plant manager or shift supervisor will contact the Lansing Fire Department (911).  Fire Department representatives are aware of the on-site ammonia storage and perodically conduct "
