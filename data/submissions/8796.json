It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to provide an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our facilities.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the South County Regional Water Treatment Plant (SCRWTP) is municipal water treatment.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility is 20 tons.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario according to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document is \"the greatest amount held in a single vessel.\"  The worst-case scenario is the complete release of chlorine from a one-ton container.  The worst-case scenario may not consider the use of active mitigation such as emergency scrubbers.\n\nThe chlorine toxic endpoint defined by 40 CFR Part 68 is 0.0087 mg/l which is equivalent to 3 parts per million by volume (ppm).  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2, this toxic endpoint is specified as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"\n\nThe SLAB computer model was used to simulate the worst-case scenario.  The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 2.93 miles.  This distance considered the mitigation provided by the building but did not include the use of "

In addition, a comprehensive risk management program has been developed to prevent accidental releases.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario modeled is the worst-case scenario with the emergency scrubber in operation It is assumed that a one-ton container reputes and releases all of its contents within the Process/Chemical building.  When the release is detected, the emergency scrubber is activated. There is no off-site impact for the alternative release scenario.  This alternative release scenario is not likely to occur; however, it demonstates that off-site impacts do not occur even for the worst-case scenario when the active mitigation system is used.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCollier County is in compliance with 40 CFR 68.  The County has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the regulations.\n\nThe County has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building, and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber, to minimize the consequences of an accidental release.  The Risk Management Program addresses actions to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release and to minimize the impact if one occurs.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe SCRWTP has not had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by 40 CFR 68.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program that is coordianted with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state and federal regulations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe hazard review resulted in the development of a list of improvements and an implementation schedule.

A sign \n  indicating a 10 mph speed limit should be posted along the roadway.  Additionally, all    construction \n  contract documents should require the contractor to maintain the roadway in suitable condition for safe \n  use for chemical delivery.\n\n  The chlorine piping system should be modified to isolate the pressure gauge from the header to prevent a \n  potential leak at the header pressure gauge.\n\n  Request Standard Operating Procedures and certification that chlorine meets AWWA specifications from \n  the chlorine supplier.  \"Cherry Pickers\" cranes should be required for chlorine delivery by October 2000 \n  to minimize handling and rolling of the ton container.\n\n  Spare injectors and check valves should be purchased and kept on site for backup in case of a failure.\n  \n  The emergency evacuation plan should be revised to include a second egress route as well as a \n  reassembly area for personnel to meet. A site coordinator should be assigned on every shift.  Additional \n  revisions are to be addressed in May 2000.\n\n  Due to the chemical nature of chlorine, any work performed in the chlorine areas that involves heat or \n  sparks should be closely monitored.   Hot work permitting should be implemented.\n\n  A program for respirator maintenance and training that provides for purchase of spare parts and \n  cartridge replacement should be implemented.\n\n  The monorail used to move chlorine containers has a potential of sticking in place.
