The purpose of the PSM/RM Program is to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. The PSM/RM Prevention Program contains thirteen elements, tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the Program requirements. These thirteen elements consist of the following:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review Program, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Contractor Qualifications, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\nReddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-Plant City management are committed to operating safe and compliant facilities for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include exhaust purge fans, controls that shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting down the entire system if required. Ammonia detection units are installed to notify employees in the event of an ammonia leak. Administrative controls are in place that limit the utilization of vessels at less than their intended maximum capacities.\n\nThe company has also developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel.\n",

The facility utilizes an estimated 27,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) as a refrigerant for their ice manufacturing and storage.\n\nThe refrigeration system design is a direct ammonia process.  The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, low oil differential on all compressors, level control switches on all applicable vessels and approved pressure safety relief valves on all applicable equipment that discharge into a common header, which vents into two 20,000 gallon deluge tanks located outside the facility.\n\nThe system consists of four thermosyphon cooled rotary screw compressor packages, three induced draft evaporative condensers, one thermosyphon receiver vessel, one controlled-pressure receiver vessel, eight 80-ton tube ice machines, two liquid ammonia pump recirculator packages, eleven air-cooling axial fan evaporators and a plate and frame heat exchanger water chiller system.  A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) monitors the system and controls system operations.  \n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to replenish the ammonia in the system as required.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent.  Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through employee training, an increased knowledge base of the equipment, and the development, maintenance and implementation of effective operating and maintenance procedures for all ammonia equipment.\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Plant City facility is committed to operating a safe and compliant ammonia refrigeration system for the protection of its employees, the general public and the environment.

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice Group corporate management and Reddy Ice-Plant City management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA?s Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets.

The plant manager has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. Monthly safety meetings are conducted to present various safety topics and discussions and to address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Plant City facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-Plant City facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-Plant City facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect change"

The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\nThe Reddy Ice-Plant City facility is a newly-constructed state of the art plant. No significant changes are planned to the facility or operations. Reddy Ice facilities operate an ongoing program of preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. On a corporate level, Reddy Ice is continuing to implement ammonia diffusion/neutralization system installation at all plants and supporting the installation of additional ammonia detection, alarm, ventilation, and safety systems at its larger facilities."
