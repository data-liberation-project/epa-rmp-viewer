We manufacture more than 100 chemical products, 85 percent of which are consumed in the U.S. and the rest are sold on the international market, contributing significantly to the U.S. gross national product.\n\n\n\nOur products include colorants and chemicals used to produce pigment dispersions for paints and inks, dyes for technical applications, food colors, cosmetic colors, and specialty products. The Hilton Davis plant has been doing business in Cincinnati since 1922. We have 141 employees with an annual payroll of $9 million. Each year, we buy about $29 million in goods and services, with a significant amount from local suppliers, and pay about $3.0 million for utilities and $1.0 million for freight services. Our plant uses one chemical as a raw material that brings us under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule. This is 65% oleum which is used in our sulfonation process, and is classified as a toxic under the RMP. The types of programs recently required by the RMP to prevent serious accidents and to plan emergency contingencies have long been in place at our plant. We have long understood and appreciate the essential relationship between good safety and environmental performance, with good business. Nevertheless, we welcome the EPA's RMP initiative and see it as an opportunity to continue and expand dialog with our community.\n\n\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nPOLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nIt is the policy of Emerald Hilton Davis, LLC to meet or exceed all requirements established by applicable safety, health and environmental regulations promulgated by Federal and State agencies.

It is our policy to maintain at a practical minimum, the potential for harm to on-site employees and contractors, the public, and the environment, and to have in place contingency actions coordinated with local responding agencies, for the unlikely event of a serious accidental chemical release. The success of this policy is exemplified by having received the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce Corporate Environment Award, and the Ohio Chemical Technology Council's (OCTC) Commitment to Excellence in Safety and Environment Award 7 years running.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\n\nPREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe have in place a thorough, ongoing program of process safety management (PSM). This program calls for implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to eliminate or reduce the effects of any release that might occur. We have invested and continue to invest substantial effort and capital in maintaining our strong safety and environmental performance. Some recent examples include the investment of over $200,000 for the installation of sulfonation equipment another safety improvement is our plant wide safety management program with a cost of over $700,000 in 2015 alone. We also have an ongoing investment in an employee safety incentive program. We are involved in day-to-day safety-focused activities under our program that include elements such as:\n\n\n\n(1) Process Hazard Analyses - we routinely perform and maintain up to date, systematic and thorough studies of our operations to identify what could go wrong, identify means of eliminating or reducing design or procedural weaknesses, and implementing improvements.\n\n\n\n(2) Process Design - our processes and equipment are designed for sa"

Designs include, as appropriate, emergency shutdown systems, pressure relief devices, ventilation systems, and release sensing systems. Our storage vessels, which contain the greatest inventories of hazardous chemicals, are contained in concrete dikes and mainly indoors. (3) Training - our operations and maintenance personnel are trained thoroughly on their job tasks, on safe work practices as they apply to their jobs, and emergency contingency actions, before they may operate or maintain equipment. They also receive refresher training periodically. Our procedures for operating and maintaining processes, general safe work practices and emergency response, are fully documented and maintained up to date in light of any changes at the plant. We have recently implemented a Computer-Based training program for all employees that provides training and verification on of understanding for Safety related topics including Safe Work Practices.\n\n\n\n(4) Maintenance - Each item of equipment at our plant that is involved in maintaining safety or in responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested and/or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition.\n\n\n\n(5) Management of Change - no change to equipment or procedural practices can take place at the plant without a thorough review of the implications of that change to safety. No change must adversely impact the safety built into the design and operations of our processes.\n\n\n\nOur PSM program is tuned to reflect the specific hazards of the chemicals we use. For example, our operating, maintenance, safe work, and emergency procedures address personal protective equipment appropriate to the chemicals being handled. Also, equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposures, including release detection devices.\n\n\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have NOT had any events at our plant that qualify for incl"

This performance reflects the positive impact that our ongoing preventative process safety programs have had on the safe handling of hazardous chemicals at this plant site.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe have in place a written emergency response plan that we coordinate with the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Commission, the Cincinnati, Golf Manor, and Norwood Fire Departments, the Metropolitan Sewer District, and other local responders. New personnel are trained on the plan, we conduct refresher training annually, and we train on any revisions to the plan.  The plan is in compliance with the RMP requirements, as well as other applicable EPA and OSHA requirements.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we have an employee staffed Emergency Response Team of 18 members, that are fully trained in Hazardous Materials response. Members of this team are onsite 24/7 during active plant operations, trained and equipped to respond immediately in the unlikely event of a release.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur safety program is ongoing, involving the identification and implementation of numerous means of incremental safety performance.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe RMP provides a detailed prescription for what should be considered a worst case scenario (WCS). Under that prescription we have identified a WCS. It involves a large indoors spill of oleum. Based on use of the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, this scenario is calculated to have offsite impacts. A more credible scenario, called an alternative release scenario (ARS), was also analyzed.\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP Rule, we chose a hypothetical ARS that is severe enough to have effect beyond our fence line. The selected ARS is a highly unlikely scenario of the type our process safety management program protects against. Our ARS involves the rupture of a flexible hose during the transfer of oleum from the delivery tan"

The spilled liquid begins to evaporate resulting in the production of vapor which, based on the use of EPA modeling tools, is predicted to have impact beyond our fence line. The hypothetical oleum spill is predicted to disperse about 0.3 miles from the tanker - up to about 420 yards beyond our fence line. There are several safeguards that protect against this scenario from occurring. First, our procedures require that the hoses be thoroughly checked before the hose is used to transfer liquid. Second, we pressure test each flexible hose before it is used to transfer a hazardous material. Any leaks or poor connections would be detected during the pressure test. Third, because our operating procedures require an operator to be present during unloading, the operator would in reality turn off the transfer pump within seconds, not minutes (as assumed to achieve an offsite impact, per RMP Rule specifications) of a spill occurring. In the unlikely event of an oleum leak at the storage tank, a foaming spray system has been developed to blanket any spill to greatly reduce off-site exposure.\n\n\n\nWe expect scenarios such as this ARS to continue to be highly hypothetical and unlikely due to our ongoing program of process safety.\n\n"
