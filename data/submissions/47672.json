      "SummaryText": "The City of Clearwater East Advanced Pollution Control Facility uses two regulated toxic substances.  The first substance is chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5) which is used as a disinfectant to treat water during the chlorination process.  The second substance is sulfur dioxide (CAS 7446-09-5) which is used during the dechlorination process to remove the residual chlorine from the effluent and maintain discharge compliance.\n\nThe chlorination process consists of chlorine storage and the chlorination system used to disinfect the water.  The chlorination process begins with the withdrawal of chlorine from the chlorine cylinders by a vacuum created by vacuum regulators mounted on the cylinders.  The chlorine gas travels through pipes to chlorinators, where the chlorine supply is regulated and measured.  From the chlorinators, chlorine is mixed with reuse water by chlorine injectors to produce a solution which is injected into the effluent water for disinfection. \n\nThe dechlorination process is similar to the chlorination process.  It consists of the sulfur dioxide storage and the dechlorination system.   Sulfur dioxide is withdrawn from the sulfur dioxide cylinders by a vacuum created by vacuum regulators, passed through pipes to the sulfonators, finally to the sulfur dioxide injectors where sulfur dioxide in solution is injected into the chlorinated effluent.  \n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), we have developed and maintain an accidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for our facility. The accidental release prevention program satisfies the requirements for the EPA RMP and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention program ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of an accidental relea"

      "SummaryText": "se due to human error, or equipment failure at our facility.  In order to prevent the release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide due to human error, our prevention program ensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in our program.  Employees and contractors working near or on the chlorination and dechlorination processes are required to be trained in the processes and the hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in an accidental release, our program ensures that equipment inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance in accordance with accepted engineering practices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  All chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are examined upon delivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage.  In addition, equipment pertaining to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are visually inspected daily.  The potential for a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release is greatly reduced in the chlorination and dechlorination processes due to the use of a vacuum system from the point of withdrawal to their points of application.  In the event that there is a failure in chlorination or dechlorination equipment, the system will automatically shutoff (i.e. failsafe).  \n\nAll existing and proposed future chlorination and dechlorination equipment have been designed according to applicable standards and codes.  The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspection and tests.  Precautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested, that all changes on the process are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the chlorination and dechlorination processes and to evaluate and control where the potential for chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases exist.  Employees were involved in determining hazards of the proce"

The chlorination and dechlorination processes were found to be operating safely and no changes were recommended. \n  \nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at our facility.  Employees have been assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.  We have developed many different forms to assist employees in recording and documenting the various elements of the RMP. \n\nAt the time of submittal of this Risk Management Plan, there have been no reportable releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide at our facility in the past five years.  However, in the event that there is an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, an Emergency Action Plan has been written in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The Facility is also included in the community LEPC emergency response plan.  Employees at our facility do not respond to accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, but coordinate with outside responders.  In the event that a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release occurs, all employees are required to evacuate the process area and report the incident.  The emergency action plan consists of evacuation procedures, facility emergency numbers, and coordination with the local Fire Department.  The plan also addresses notification procedures to the public and the local emergency response agency."
