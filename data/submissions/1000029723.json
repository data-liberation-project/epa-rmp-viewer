The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.  \r\n\r\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group - McFarland, California to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility is located at 31795 Whisler Road in McFarland, California.

The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of agricultural and sparse residential areas.     \r\n\r\nIn order to conduct operations, The Wine Group - McFarland, California maintains a refrigeration system that contains a total of approximately 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California ammonia system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  The staff at the facility is trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia system.  All pressure vessels in the ammonia system are equipped with relief valves that vent to the atmosphere at a certain pressure set point. A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are inspected regularly to ensure proper operation.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds for ammonia) in the past five years (September 2007 through September 2012).

The facility was evacuated and the fire department was notified.  The facility also notified the California Emergency Management Agency, and the Kern County Environmental Health Department.  As a precautionary measure, the National Response Center was also notified since the facility did not know the  of the release.  Recommendations resulting from the incident investigation included replacing the oil pump and adding a copy of the piping diagrams in the Emergency Action Plan binder.  The facility also conducted a meeting with affected personnel to review the lessons learned from the incident.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.) To save lives.\r\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.) To protect the environment.\r\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group - McFarland, California facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated Emergency Coordinator for the facility.
