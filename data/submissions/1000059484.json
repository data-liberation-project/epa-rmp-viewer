      "SummaryText": "ill Coils\r\n(4) AcuAir Units with Integral Surge Drums\r\n\r\nThe CST Ammonia Refrigeration process operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a liquid feed solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the main suction accumulator and then the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system was built in 2015-2016 by Cold Storage Technologies. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Each entrance to a machinery room contains emergency refrigeration shutdown and ventilation controls for use during an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nThe CST Ammonia Refrigeration process at Sanger Poultry consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, Sanger Poultry has one (1) refrigeration process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.
