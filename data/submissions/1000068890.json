Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response policies\n\nThe facility's emergency response follows the policies outlined in the chlorine institute's pamphlet 64 (emergency response plans for chlorine facilities). The plan includes notification of the local fire department. \n\n\n\n2.    Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis facility handles two chemicals above the RMP threshold limits: Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. They are both stored in 150 lb. and ton sized cylinders. Neither chemical is packaged or used at this facility. \n\n\n\n3.    Accidental release prevention program\n\nA third party general duty audit was recently performed at the facility and corrective actions are in the process of being closed.  With the addition of chlorine and sulfur dioxide a Process Hazard Analysis was conduct and those corrective actions are also in the process of being closed.  The facility checks all of the cylinders that cross their docks for tampering and damage as per their standard operating procedure. A separate Harcros facility is the sole provider of Chlorine to all Harcros facilities. That site performs all of the required hydrostatic testing and changes out the valves each time the cylinders are filled. The sulfur dioxide is purchased from a vendor that adheres to the guidelines set forth by the Chlorine Institute. \n\nAccess to the storage area is limited to Harcros employees and contractors/visitors that both have a need to be in the area and have had a background check meeting the requirements set forth by DHS. \n\n\n\n4.    5-year accident history\n\nNo RMP process related accidents have occurred at this facility within the last five years\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response is outlined in their Emergency Action plan w"

The facility's RMP chemical storage area is equipped with an analytical camera that sends notification if an intruder enters that area.  Harcros works closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and the Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.   \n\n\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe facility will be installing chlorine gas detectors which will be tied into the alarm panel in 2018.   This is in addition to the security upgrades already made to the facility.  \n\n\n\n"
