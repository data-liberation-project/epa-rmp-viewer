This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.   It is company policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies. Safety is an essential part of facility operations as evidenced by the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source\n\nThe facility's primary activities include distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals including compressed gases for use in water and wastewater treatment.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management Program\n\nThe Company has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes "

Through implementation of PSM/RMP program, DPC has utilized several different methodologies over the years to complete these analyses including the What-if, Hazop (Hazard and Operability Study), Checklist as well as a Hazop/Checklist (combined) approach.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years as required or as necessary.  Findings and recommendations assigned from the hazard analysis are documented within the electronic management system and completed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that all Company employees and any contractor employees, if appropriate, involved in production for covered processes are subject to the Company training program.  All maintenance training for these covered processes is addressed in the Mechanical Integrity Policy.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  A maintenance procedure and associated checklist(s) are attached to work orders that are printed out of the electronic management system.  A documented review of the procedure is required prior to the start of each job.  This review is to ensure the employee has the knowledge and skills necessary to complete the task and that he/she understands "

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are documented and completed work orders are uploaded into the electronic management system.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. MOC will address both permanent and temporary changes.  Temporary changes will be considered in the same manner as permanent changes.  To ensure affected personnel are aware of changes made to the facility, MOC(s) will be reviewed and documented through the training roster.  MOCs will be initiated and completed through an electronic management system.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) will be performed for significant MOCs, for new processes regulated under OSHA's PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and  processes covered under EPA's RMP Program under 40 CFR 68 as well as modified existing covered processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  Records of the PSSR shall be maintained in the electronic management system.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Company conducts an audit at the facility using an audit template which serves as the verification sheet providing the auditors with the necessary information to expedite the review of the program and ensure all requirements of the standards are met.  The audit is completed every 3-years and is certified as required.  All deficiencies and recommendations will be completed and tracked within the electronic management system.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Company"

An incident investigation shall be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident.  The incident investigation and report will be processed through the electronic management system.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Company believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Facility employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of a regulated substance from this facility this period.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nLocal responders are invited to tour the facility and meet facility personnel on a regular basis.  In addition, it is Company policy for site personnel to participate in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A copy of the emergency response plan is offered to the fire department and LEPC.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThrough our ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP program, the Company looks continuously for possible system changes to improve our operations.  This is demonstrated in our active participation in Chlorine Institute programs which many regulators consider Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) for our operations."
