      "SummaryText": "This executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Las Vegas Street Wastewater Treatment Plant (Las Vegas Street WWTP), one of several facilities owned and operated by the Colorado Springs Utilities.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nColorado Springs Utilities has determined that this facility is required to comply with RMP Program 2.  Colorado Springs Utilities believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Colorado Springs Utilities has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. \n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nColorado Springs Utilities takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Las Vegas Street WWTP) and actively participated in comprehensive hazard review.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the cover"

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for emergency response, Colorado Springs Utilities has established and maintains emergency procedures.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Las Vegas Street WWTP is located at 825 Las Vegas Street in Colorado Springs, El Paso County, Colorado.  The Las Vegas Street WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical, biological, and chemical treatment operations.  The facility provides service to over 300,000 people residing within a 150 square-mile area.  An average of 45 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater is treated daily;  the maximum treatment rate of the facility is 75 MGD (wet) or 65 MGD (dry).\n\nThe Las Vegas Street WWTP utilizes chlorine as a disinfecting agent in the treatment of wastewater and sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The Las Vegas Street WWTP is regulated under Program 2 of the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used at the facility.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\u00b7 Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n\u00b7 Hazard review, which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the c"

In the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the storage rooms, the normal ventilation system shuts down and the contaminated air is sent to the scrubber for neutralization.  The scrubber is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chemical release event.\n\nPrevention Steps for Sulfur Dioxide\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP manual.
