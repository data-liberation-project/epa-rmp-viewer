L. Adams Plastics, Inc. is a producer of polystyrene foam using Difluoroethane and Isopentane to produce various products using tandem extrusion lines. The extruded product is in sheet form. This sheet is converted into various products.\n\n\n\nThis facility has strict no smoking and hot work policies in effect campus wide. No smoking signs are posted inside and outside the campus. Only trained and qualified personnel are allowed to off load Difluoroethane and Isopentane. The Difluoroethane and Isopentane tanks are located in an isolated area surrounded by concrete block wall with a locked fence gate to restrict access. The Isopentane tank has a dike for secondary containment.  The tanks have an earth ground to protect the tank and for the bonding of offloading trucks. Both tanks have a bulk load delivery system to insure safety of the unloading process and eliminate the risk of spills from delivery hoses.   Both tanks are inspected at the end of each shift. All employees are trained annually in the safe handling and flammability of the product. New employee orientation procedure includes safeguards to Difluoroethane and Isopentane. The building has LEL monitors at 12 points throughout the building, with alarms and automatic phone call list at specific LEL alarm points.  \n\n\n\nThe overall safety program at R.L.
