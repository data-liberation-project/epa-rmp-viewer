The quick freezer is used for the initial freezing of vegetables.  The plate chiller provides cold water for cleaning and cooling the fresh vegetables. \n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Cebro facility due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario.  A worst-case release scenario is defined in the regulations as \u00bfthe greatest amount held in a single vessel\u00bfreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA.\n.  \nThe RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Cebro has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Cebro ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n\u00b7 emergency"

Seq.  The regulations are also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 68.\n\nCebro prepared the RMP program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Cebro has incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Cebro personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the local fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team.  Cebro will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP program.\n\nCebro is located at 2100 Orestimba Road in Newman, California.  The area is zoned for agricultural and industrial use.  The facility is approximately 2 miles west of Highway 33, which runs north and south through Newman.  Cebro is a family owned business that produces frozen vegetables.  Cebro constructed the facility in 1993 with all new refrigeration system components. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 17,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to: formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lock-out/tag-out program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program and an RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility.  The SOPs will provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nCebro is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.  The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  The Cebro facility at 2100 Orestimba Road reported no accidental release of ammonia during the past five years.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.
