      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nUpton Assets, LLC owns and operates the Pecos Liquids Handling Facility, a natural gas liquids processing plant, located approximately 5.75 miles west of Pecos, Texas.  The incoming Natural Gas Liquids and condensate streams are stabilized and treated to meet sales specifications and routed to pressurized tanks for storage.  Based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, the Pecos Liquids Handling Facility is subject to the requirements of OSHA\u2019s Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard codified under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Further, the facility is subject to US EPA\u2019s Risk Management Program Level 2. \n\nStorage of Hazardous Material and Potential Exposure:\nThe regulated flammable substances identified at the facility are NGLs and un-stabilized condensate. For the purpose of identifying the maximum release quantity for use in determining potential off-site impacts, it is assumed that the entire contents of the vessel or the system are released to the atmosphere, presenting a worst-case scenario (WCS) of release through vapor cloud explosion.  NGL (Off Spec) stored in TK-103 (Off Spec NGL Storage Tank) with a level of 54,000 gallons was determined to result in the WCS.  The distance to the endpoint of 1-psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable mixture was calculated to be 0.50 mile using the EPA\u2019s RMP*Comp.  An alternative scenario of release type of BLEVE was used to calculate an endpoint distance of 0.6 miles at which exposure may cause second-degree burns.  Within 0.6 miles of the facility, approximately 50 mobile homes are parked in the man-camp setting that are considered to be receptors potentially impacted by exposure through the wort-case and alternative scenarios.\n\nFive-Year Accident Facility:\nThe Pecos Liquids Handling Facility is a new facility; therefore, this facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed"
