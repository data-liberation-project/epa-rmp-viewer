As \nit is Camp Frio Inc.'s policy to comply with all applicable governmental \nregulations, the cold storage facility was designed and constructed in 1997 to the \n1991 Uniform Building Code/Uniform Mechanical Code.  Personnel at Camp Frio \nCold Storage monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration system.  All service, \nmaintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to \na qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  \nUtilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, \nmaintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating \ncondition. \n\nWhile it is Camp Frio Inc.'s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community \nin all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility \nprecludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan \nhas been prepared for Camp Frio Cold Storage and a chain of command to \nrespond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nCamp Frio Inc. owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 31792 \nMerced Avenue.  Shafter is the closest city to the Camp Frio Cold Storage \nfacility.  The rural plant was constructed in 1997 utilizing all new equipment at the \ntime of construction. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for \nthe Camp Frio Cold Storage facility.  The refrigeration system consists of a \nsuction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, three compressors, an \nevaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver, and several flooded \nevaporators.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the \nrefrigeration syste"

However, during major maintenance activities, the entire \nrefrigeration system can be \"pumped down\" to evacuate the ammonia from the \nsystem and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of \nammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 15,390 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define \nthe toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This \nconcentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene \nAssociation as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or \ndeveloping irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could \nimpair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response \nplanning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary \nsource to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \nanalyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nSince the ammonia-based refrigeration system at Camp Frio Cold Storage is \nconsidered a Program 3 process, both release scenarios were evaluated in the \noffsite consequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential \npopulation within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenario.  \nThis area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the distance the \nrelease would travel with concentrations at or above the toxic endpoint.  The \ncircle also defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be \nidentified.\n\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA a"

For liquefied \ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \nworst-case release scenario.  For Camp Frio Cold Storage, the alternative \nrelease scenario was selected based on the results of the Process Hazard \nAnalysis (PHA) for the ammonia-based refrigeration system. A credible release \nevent with a high discharge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite \nimpact.  A leak from a valve packing was identified in the PHAs as having a \nmedium probability of occurrence with a discharge rate high enough to cause an \noffsite impact, and therefore, was chosen as the alternative release scenario.\n\nCamp Frio Cold Storage has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-\ncase and alternative release scenarios.  For the worst-case release scenario, the \nrelease of 15,390 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minute period outside of the engine \nroom, the plume would travel 1.5 miles at concentrations at or above the \nendpoint.  Using 1990 Census data, the population potentially affected within the \nworst-case release scenario circle is 75 persons.  Due to the rural location of this \nfacility, the population potentially affected by this worst case release is \nsubstantially overstated by the 1990 Census data.  There were no environmental \nreceptors within the worst case release scenario circle.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, a packing leak from an isolation valve located \noutdoors was modeled as a release of liquefied ammonia stored under pressure.  \nFor a release of 22 lb/min of anhydrous ammonia, the model calculated that the \nplume would travel less than 0.1 mile at "
