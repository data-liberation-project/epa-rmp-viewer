Description of the Buda, TX Facility\n\nThe Buda, TX facility is located at 1235 B South Loop 4, Buda, TX 78610. The facility provides\n\ntransportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged\n\nspecialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as\n\nspecified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Buda, TX Warehouse include\n\nchemicals containing toxic hazards. Hydrochloric Acid 37% is the only RMP regulated substances handled at the site.\n\n1.2.2. Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\n\nRinchem receives Hydrochloric acid 37% by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the material passes quality and safety inspection, it is placed into the hazard specific storage area until it is shipped to the end user. The storage location of each material is tracked in an electronic inventory management system.\n\nAfter an order is received, Rinchem ships the above listed chemical as ordered by the end user.

The Emergency Response Program\n\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Buda, TX Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to\n\nprevent accidental releases of Hydrochloric acid 37% from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above mentioned material. Rinchem has developed an emergency action plan to minimize the effects of accidental releases of hydrochloric acid 37% to employees (vapordispersion modeling demonstrates no impact public receptors). Rinchem management has opted not to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.\n\nThe Buda, TX Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\n\nEmergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n\nChemical Exposure and Chemical Spill Cleanup Procedure\n\nEmergency Evacuation Plan\n\nThe Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to\n\nfire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise.
