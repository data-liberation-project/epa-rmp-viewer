Those\r\nrecommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in Planned Changes to Improve\r\nSafety. \r\n1.4. The Five Year Accident History\r\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Hydrochloric acid 37% or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc, Buda, TX Warehouse.\r\n1.5. The Emergency Response Program\r\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Buda, TX Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to\r\nprevent accidental releases of Hydrochloric acid 37% from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above mentioned material. Rinchem has developed an emergency action plan to minimize the effects of accidental releases of hydrochloric acid 37% to employees (vapordispersion modeling demonstrates no impact public receptors). Rinchem management has opted not to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup.\r\nThe Buda, TX Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\r\nEmergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\r\nChemical Exposure and Chemical Spill Cleanup Procedure\r\nEmergency Evacuation Plan\r\nThe Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to\r\nfire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise. The emergency action plan\r\nand documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to\r\ncontent and structure of the plan."
