      "SummaryText": "The AVIKO USA facility located in Jamestown, North Dakota is a potato processing facility that  handles ammonia which is considered toxic by EPA. The primary purpose of this facility is to process potato into food products such as french fries for distribution to retailers and restaurants.  The facility started up the ammonia refrigeration system in October 1996.\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since the start up of the existing facility in 1996. The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with state codes.  This food processing facility complies with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nFurthermore, the facility has a dump tank where the ammonia for the refrigeration system can be directed to purge the system in an emergency.  This dump tank is full of water and is of a capacity to receive the entire ammonia capacity of the system.  Also, all Saf"

      "SummaryText": "ety Relief Valves, except those on four of five condensers, are piped to the dump tank as a added safety feature.  \n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using on the job training and a formal training program based on materials such as from IIAR a nationally recognized authority in ammonia refrigeration.  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  The facility plans to replace  Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.  \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Jamestown Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Jamestown Fire Department visited this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to minimize any ammonia release.  These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThe facility has had two ammonia releases, both occurring in 1997 as a result of mechanical failure of new equipment.  No one off site was injured.  Also no one on site was injured and as a result of the release there was no property damage.  \n\nIn regards to the worst case release scenario for ammonia as defined by EPA, the worst case release scenario for ammonia from the high pressure receiver (located inside) could extend beyond the AVIKO property.  An alternative, more likely, release scenario could just extend beyond the property but not in all directions"
