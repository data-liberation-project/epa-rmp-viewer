All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAslan Cold Storage Reedley has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and publicsafety. Nevertheless, Aslan Cold Storage Reedley continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Aslan Cold Storage Reedley\u0092s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Aslan Cold Storage Reedley\u0092s management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nAslan Cold Storage Reedley has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Aslan Cold Storage Reedley has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Aslan Cold Storage Reedley now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Aslan Cold Storage Reedley employees, but allows for feedback"

The ammonia processes contain a total charge of approximately 29,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use.
