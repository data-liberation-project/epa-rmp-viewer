Lorain takes water from Lake Erie and treats it and pumps finished drinking water to over 71,000 customers and businesses.  Chlorine is used in this process to disinfect the water.\n\nChlorine is stored in ton cylinders.  The chlorine inventory varies from less than 4 tons to 11 tons.\n\nWe are dedicated to plant safety and are constantly striving to increase our personnel's knowledge of plant safety.  We are constantly updating our emergency plans to ensure the safest possible plans are in place in the unlikely event of a chemical mishap.\n\nWe have chlorine detection devices in place to detect a chlorine leak.  Our chlorine detection system has audio alarms.  We have recently installed an automatc chlorine shut-off.  Feed equipment is in place and is constantly being monitored by a computer system.  All supervisors and plant personnel review our emergency contingency plan annually.\n\nThe management of the Water Plant is committed to plant safety.  The system has and are currently developing procedures for monthly drills.  These drills include:\n        * Use of air packs\n        * Safety inspections of the chlorine feed system\n        * What to do in the unlikely event of a chlorine leak\n        * Review of fire Department ( county HazMat call-out procedures)\n\nAnnually we have:\n        * Chlorine safety workshops attended by plant personnel\n        * CPR and First Aid classes\n        * Use of chlorine \"B\" kit drills\n        * Books and videos on chlorine safety are always available\n\nWe have had no accidental chlorine releases in the past five years.\n\nA chlorine leak is unlikely based on our safety and maintenance procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in the unlikely event of a discharge.  They can act quickly to minimize the leak.  Our safety program is coordinated with management and employees with cooperation all around.   This is one of the main reasons that there has "
