Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture prepolymers.  Toluene diisocyanate, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  COIM USA manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections,  safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur site response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and outside responders so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68) and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe and Prevention Act (N.J.A.C. 7:31). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in these regulations.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture of prepolymers.  Toluene diisocyanate is used to manufacture the prepolymer products and is received and stored on-site in an aboveground storage tank. \n\n\n\n3.

This full inventory of the largest container is assumed to be all released in 10 minutes. The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint for this WCS does not reach public receptors.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such a release and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nThe \"alternative case scenario\" (ACS)  for toxic toluene diisocyanate at this facility is a process leak.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined toxic endpoint for this ACS does not reach public receptors.   No active or passive mitigations were considered in evaluating this ACS. \n\n\n\nThe actual release rates for the WCS and ACS for the toxic material is less than the release rate entered into Sections 2 or 3 of the RMP resubmission.  The release rates entered in Sections 2 and 3 are the minimum entries that can be inputed into this field. \n\n\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements  based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe and Prevention Act ( NJ TCPA).  This facility was designed and constructed to comply  with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving accidental release of TDI within the last 5 years that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage..\n\n\n\n6.
