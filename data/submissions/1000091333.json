Contractors have a representative on this team.\r\n \r\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained and uses the Houston Area Safety Council as a tool to provide the basic HSE training required of a contractor prior to entering a chemical manufacturing facility. All contractor workers must attend the Houston Area Safety Council training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant. In addition to basic training, CVON site specific training is required prior to entering the plant.

Additionally, this facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict internal engineering standards and is subject to the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, kept up-to-date, and made available to all workers.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs): A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or changes to existing processes at the design stage is utilized, with the overall thought of identifying and mitigating health, safety and environmental issues before installation or operation. Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly through a review during any operator training opportunity.  They are also reviewed every five years.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified as a result of management of change activities or after completion of a process PHA. Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\r\n\r\nOperator Training / Qualification Program: A trainin"

Butadiene is further utilized on the Poly-Butadiene process within the Mid Plant as well as sold as a finished product.\r\n\r\nEthylene:  Approximately 450,000 lbs. is produced in the Olefins processes.  It is sent to external customers.\r\n\r\nPropylene:  Approximately 570,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site. Propylene is refined in the Olefins units.\r\n\r\nFlammable Mixtures:  Approximately 230 million lbs. of flammable mixtures are stored and utilized throughout the Olefins and East/Mid Hydrocarbons units.  These include Naphtha, OP-400, and other condensate feeds stored and used in the Olefins units.   Also included are various hydrocarbon mixtures that are incoming feed stocks and/or intermediate streams for the Olefins and East/Mid Hydrocarbons units.  Regulated substances in these flammable mixtures are:  1,3-Butadiene, Butane, 1-Butene, cis- and trans-2-Butene, Ethane, Ethyl Acetylene, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isobutylene, Isopentane, Isoprene, Methane, 2-Methyl-1-Butene, 3-Methyl-1-Butene, 1,3-Pentadinene, Pentane,  1-Pentene, 2-Pentene, Propadiene, Propane, Propylene, Propyne, and Vinyl Acetylene.\r\n\r\nThe site is installing an additional 24,000,000 lbs. of storage capacity for Crude C4s, containing a flammable mixture of many of the regulated substances listed above.  Therefore, this submittal includes predictive filing.  Installation of these new storage spheres includes protective measures such as a remote impoundment basin and fire-fighting safeguards including a new firewater tank with pumps, fixed monitors and hydrocarb"

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the risk for all stakeholders.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent and mitigate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. We also coordinate with the Houston Ship Channel Area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nOur facility cracks Naphtha, OP-400, and condensates into a number of products that include Ethylene, Propylene, Butadiene, Isoprene, Isobutane, and other olefins. In addition, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) and an assortment of products are produced in the East Plant / Mid Plant unit, including Isopropanol. There are two Olefins Cracking units and one East Plant/Mid Plant manufacturing unit.   These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of their substantial accidental release: \r\n\r\nToxics - \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  Approximately  140,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is stored in pressurized tanks for use in the Methanol and Olefins 1 and 2 units air pollution abatement equipment to reduce emissions"
