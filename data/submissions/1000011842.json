      "SummaryText": "Endicott Island is the first continuous operating offshore oilfield in the Arctic and is classified as NAICS code 211111, Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction.  Current production is approximately 20, 000 bbls per day.\n\nEndicott is located approximately 2.5 miles from Alaska's northern coast in the Beaufort Sea.  A three-mile man-made gravel causeway connects Endicott's two man-made gravel islands.  The 45-acre Main Production Island (MPI) was constructed as a self-contained facility and can house up to 150 employees and contractors.  The MPI has its own operating and processing, living facilities, life support systems, medical clinic, firefighting and spill response equipment.  An operating and support crew of about 50 employees and contractors work on the MPI at any one time.\n\nPipelines are supported above ground on steel support structures.  Oil and gas liquids are transported from production wells on the MPI where oil, water and gas are separated.  Sales oil is then shipped down a 26-mile pipeline where it enters the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n\nEndicott is a PSM covered facility and participates in the VPP program at the Star level.  Endicott also has an ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System in place.\n\nEndicott utilizes a regulated substance, propane, in a dry gas refrigeration system.  The propane refrigeration system is a closed circulating loop.  Liquid propane is purchased commercially,  trucked to Endicott and added to the surge drum as needed.  The propane system consists of the following equipment and approximate inventories:\n\nV-1405 propane suction drum provides vaporized propane to the propane compressor.  At normal operating level, the suction drum contains approximately 1,450 gallons @ 4.8 lbs/gal = 6960 lbs.\nK-1405 propane compressor raises the system pressure and forces the propane vapor through a condenser.\nV-1406 propane surge drum provides storage for the condensed propane and supplies liquid propane to the flash drum.  At normal "

      "SummaryText": "operating level, the surge drum contains approximately 3,390 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 14240 lbs.\nV-1407 propane flash drum provides liquid propane storage.  At normal operating level, the flash drum contains approximately 1,315 gallons @ 4.8 lbs/gal = 6,315 lbs.\n\nTotal propane inventory onsite is approximately 27, 500 lbs.\nV-1405, V-1406, and V-1407 are located outside of module 303 in the NW corner.\n\nCatastrophic loss of inventory of the propane surge drum V-1406 is the basis for the Worst Case Scenario calculations.  The model used was EPA's OCA Guidance Reference tables or equations.\n\nEndicott Operations has its own professionally-trained fire department which responds and serves as the local fire department.  There is no other jurisdiction providing emergency response at Endicott, with the exception of mutual aid provided by the fire departments of other nearby  North-Slope Alaska oil fields."
