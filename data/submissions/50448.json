The Dallas Chemical Center is assisted by the Air Liquide Electronics US LP HAZMAT team.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nAs is our policy at Air Liquide, we continue to audit our process(es) for possibilities of improvement to process, operational methods, and new technology to lower risk. In conclusion to our most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Air Liquide\u00bfs Dallas Chemical Center location plans to:\n1. investigate additional leak risk mitigation for single walled pipes within containment areas\n2. expand emergency action plan and safety shower inspection procedure to clarify actions performed if plant water supply is compromised\n3. verify emergency shutdown alarm can be clearly heard in all outside locations\n4. investigate backup power supply for lighting exterior to the building(s)\n5. investigate options for quickly knowing if a worker is incapacitated in the event a person was working alone in the process area\n6. re-label valves for process for identification purposes\n7. investigate possibility of additional valve to limit the potential for leakage on lines containing single isolation valves\n8. expand and clarify shutdown procedures in SOPs\n9. add \u00bfas built\u00bf process and instrumentation diagrams to document retention\n10. investigate additional spill containment options in case of primary containment failure\nto improve our process to be implemented by January 1, 2008."
