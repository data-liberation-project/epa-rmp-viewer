The Wilson Facility repackages a variety of water-based  chemicals and warehouses others. Safe handling and shipment is critical for our employees, our customers, and the surrounding communities. We employ 31 including 13 highly trained hazmat drivers.  These drivers also handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders for delivery. These gases, which can be toxic in high concentrations, are critical to providing safe water for many localities in NC. The facility operates approximately 12 hrs. per day and has 24 hr. surveillance.  The proximity of the facility to the other commercial areas and residential areas requires a high level of care. The risk of off-site effects are extremely unlikely, and  in the past twenty years there have been no facility accidents involving a reportable release of these chemicals. Less than catastrophic releases would be minimized within the building.\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are received from the supplier, leak checked, and stored in secured cages.  The products are liquefied gases under low pressure (25-125 psi).  The cylinders are DOT specification heavy-walled cylinders that are not opened or modified by Water Guard . They are built to withstand normal and accident conditions incident to transportation. Our supplier inspects the cylinders each time they are filled and hydrostatically pressure tests the cylinders every 5 years to 500 psi. Chlorine Institute training materials are used and are the source of the written procedures, Safety Data Sheets and Safety checklists are used by the supplier and Water Guard Inc .\n\nSince there are no inter-container transfers, the only threat of release from these transportation cylinders would be from a release from the fusible valve plug that activates at 160 deg F in a fire.

      "SummaryText": "ion, trace leaks may result from faulty supplier procedures. The isolation of the cylinders from flammable materials, valve seals, and leak check inspections control these possibilities. Employees have also been trained in the use of the full face respirators for leak checking. Respirators are maintained in different areas of the plant outside of the chlorine storage area. The facility has never had a site accident with these chemicals since construction of the facility.\n\nAll employees have received training on the standard operating procedure to follow if a chlorine leak were to occur. Evacuation drills are held. Response coordination with the local Wilson city FD is conducted and is backed up by the NC Regional Hazardous Material Response Team.
