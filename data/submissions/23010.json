              "Description": "This system is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit  the amount of ammonia held in the storage tank. The unloading of ammonia tank trucks is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\nAmmonia pump (10-110-045A)\nTested Pressure Relief Valves\nStorage Tank Inspection (10-110-044)\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. All nozzles on the tank are fitted with excess flow valves except for nozzles with pressure relief valves. A local level indicator is available on the tank with a transmitter conveying  the level measurement into the control room. This instrument is used to monitor and control the tank level.\n\nThe pressure relief valves are tested annually. The entire system undergoes annual maintenance which includes: external inspection, checks for any leaks, bolt tightness on the manway. Wall thickness tests are done every five years - the last test was 1997. An internal inspection of the welds was done in 1991.\n\nAmmonia is transferred to an ammonia / water mixer to prepare a solution that is pumped to a surge tank . The solution is then pumped to the chemical processing equipment and used to manufacture an agricultural product.\n\nAll changes to this system fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted for all changes.",

Operators are trained and certified.\nPump 02-140-002A & B\nPump 02-130-009A & B\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. The tank contents are maintained at  about 40 degrees F. This tank vents via a conservation vent to a seal pot and then to an incinerator where the fumes are destroyed. Two flare systems are used to back up the incinerator for odor control.\n\nThe tank is equipped with emergency relief devices to protect against overpressurization. Redundant level instruments and a high level switch are used to monitor and control tank level. During railcar/tank truck unloading, an excess flow switch in the unloading system is used to close the automatic valve if high flow is detected. Remote emergency shut off stations close the unloading valve if activated.\n\nThe mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to produce an agricultural product. This equipment is equipped with a high level alarm and a high level switch that is interlocked to shutdown the feed and close the automatic valve. The reactor fumes are vented via a seal pot on their way to the incinerator for destruction. This system is also governed by operating procedures used by certified operators.\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.\n\nThe entire mercaptan handling system undergoes annual maintenance and inspection as well as a five-year, vessel and piping thickness testing program and a 20 year internal inspection.",

              "Description": "Anhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCl)  is transported to the plant site in unique cylinders (600 pounds of liquified HCl per cylinder). These cylinders are transported by truck. They are unloaded using a towmotor.\nReactor (130-051)\n\nHCl is transferred from the cylinders to the process via a pipe line. Unique pipe fittings are utilized to ensure that only HCl is transferred to the process. The piping system is designed to minimize potential leak spots by using the latest equipment such as an excess flow valve on the cylinder discharge, rupture disks followed by relief valves, low emission packing valves, and fully welded piping except for valve and fitting connections.\n\nHCl fumes that are released while breaking hose connections to the cylinder or for maintenance purposes are captured, sent to a scrubber and neutralized. The scrubber has multiple layers of redundancy including emergency power to ensure continuous operation.\n\nThe HCl transfer system and processing equipment are equipped with instruments for monitoring the process. The system is designed to prevent events such as tank overfilling and over pressurization. The process is monitored  continuously by control and interlock systems as well as trained operating personnel.\n\nThe HCl building is inspected regularly for leaks and other potential problems. It is also monitored continuously for HCl leaks. If a leak is detected, the system will alarm, shutdown the transfer equipment, and automatically start ventilating  equipment. \n\nThe process building is also monitored continuously for HCl and other chemical leaks. If a leak is detected, the detection system will sound an alarm. Trained operating staff will respond accordingly .\n\nThis process is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit  the number of cylinders on the plant site. The unloading of raw material delivery vehicles is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.",

We are also concerned with protecting our families that live in nearby communities.  We have designed our facilities to safely manage the chemicals used and produced by our production facilities. It is our policy to not only to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations but also to voluntarily go beyond these requirements to ensure our continued successful and safe operations.  We have developed and implemented the following to help achieve our goals:\n \n* State of the art process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and systems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes\n* Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\n* An extensive safety, health and process safety management system\n* Well-trained production employees coupled to a trained technical staff\n* An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\n* Plant site access is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors\n\nIn addition to these preventative programs, it is the plant's policy to maintain an up-to-date emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergencies involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue. The plant works closely with area community emergency response agencies providing them with information on plant operations and response programs in addition to conducting periodic training with members of the local emergency response agencies.\n\nBASF's Hannibal facility has six substances that exceed the RMP threshold quantities.

This tank is located within a concrete secondary containment system.  The tank is equipped with overpressure protection and is rated to withstand full vacuum. The total ammonia inventory is 41,000 pounds.

During unloading, the truck is stationed in a containment area designed to hold 110% of the truck's contents. Bromine is unloaded via top unloading system into its storage tank. A unique tank truck and unloading station are used to ensure that only the correct raw material is unloaded into the storage tank.

The railcar is positioned inside a concrete secondary containment system in the unloading area and is then connected to the ethyl mercaptan storage tank to unload. Ethyl mercaptan may also be received by tank truck in quantities of approximately 5,000 gallons.  Trucks are also unloaded in concrete secondary containment systems provided for unloading.\n\nThe ethyl mercaptan storage tank is located inside a concrete secondary containment system. The mercaptan is pumped from the storage tank to the chemical processing equipment used to manufacture an agricultural product.

Although the storage tank is designed to store approximately 110,000 pounds, plant administrative controls limit the amount to 95,000 pounds.
