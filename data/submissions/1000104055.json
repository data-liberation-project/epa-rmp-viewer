The flame detectors will alarm at the HMI when a flame is detected.\n2.\tMultiple portions of the hydrogen were susceptible to High-Temperature Hydrogen Attack (HTHA) due to the operating temperature and pressure being below the Nelson Curve. Material upgrades were made to the HTS Converter (C-103), the Quench Pot (TK-202), the Waste Heat Boiler (WH-102), the piping between the HTS Converter and the Waste Heat Boiler, and the piping between the Feed Preheater (HX-101) and the HTS Converter to prevent embrittlement of the metal from HTHA.\n3.\tIn April 2019, a rupture occurred at the flex hose closest to the quench pot. The rupture occurred due to a combination of reasons, however, it was determined that this flex hose itself represents a weak point within the H2 process. The new design eliminates this weak point. The downcomer between the Quench Pot (TK-202) and the Feed Preheater (HX-101) will be replaced by a solid piece of piping. Hydrochem, the original process manufacturer, was hired to complete the new downcomer design by ASME B31.3 Code \u201cProcess Piping\u201d. The design is similar to the current design, but with the flex hoses removed.\n4.\tAdd a hardwired temperature switch D/S of the quench pot to shut down the FSP at 1000 degrees F. This change was an ARA recommendation to decrease the risk of a high high temperature from damaging the D/S equipment"

This resulted in a fire with a duration of 05 minutes.  Dallas Emergency Responders were summoned to the facility.  Approximately 0.125 scf of Hydrogen was consumed in the fire.  The plant was evacuated.  There were no injuries or releases to the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAir Liquide's TI Boulevard location utilizes an Emergency Action Plan, Emergency Response, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and operator training to ensure personnel are trained to identify and respond to accident and emergency situations.\nAir Liquide's TI Boulevard location emergency response to accidental releases from the covered process includes: telephone notification of local fire department; telephone notification of DART; stopping and isolating equipment which may leak flammable gases; and isolation of the bulk propane tank via remote means.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nAs is our policy at Air Liquide, we continue to review our process(es) for possible improvements to process and operational methods and evaluate new technology to lower risk. Evidence of this can be seen by the various safety improvements implemented since the last RMP submission in"

The facility accomplishes this by separating constituent gasses of the atmosphere, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon by process of distillation. The facility manufactures Hydrogen by process of catalytic reformation.  During the process of manufacturing Hydrogen, Propane is combined with steam at high temperatures, which causes a reaction releasing Hydrogen. The Propane is chemically changed, not burned.\nThe stationary source located at 13140 TI Blvd, Dallas, TX, includes an 18,000 gallon (single wall, vertical) propane tank.  Additional flammable gases are also found within the process.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Policies and Steps\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's RMP Prevention Program 3, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  In addition, the propane tank was designed / installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nAir Liquide's TI Boulevard location utilizes the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:\na)  Management of change to ensure the covered process is not altered without a safety review;\nb)  Gauges and internal piping to ensure the bulk tank contains a maximum of 85% capacity;\nc)    Overpressure relief valve on the top of the tank;\nd)    Backflow prevention on the fill line;\ne)  Fail-closed emergency shut-off valves (Valves are held open by propane back pressure delivered through a consumable tubing system. The tubing will burn in case of fire, isolating the tank.);\nf)     Liquid level rate-of-change alarm on bulk tank;\ng)    Relief"
