However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release until the Local Emergency Responders arrive on scene.  Work permits, including Safe Work, Hot Work, Confined Space and Excavation Permits are issued to maintenance workers prior to work beginning.  Each permit identifies the hazards and what safe guards are to be used to prevent incidents.  \n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Hurricane gas processing plant is located just east of Hurricane, WV approximately 1 mile south of highway 60 on highway 34.  The plant processes about 10 MMCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehydrated and propane and heavier hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed to produce a saleable natural gas product. The hydrocarbons that are removed are fractionated into propane and a butane/gasoline mixed product. The plant has inlet compression, dehydration and a straight refrigeration process for product recovery.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such as propane, butane and natural gasolines.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\n\nThis facility is constructed in accordance with appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements of the PSM  program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has not experienced any accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or know"

The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency.  In addition the local fire department/emergency response department is invited onsite annually to tour and discuss scenarios in the event they have to respond.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned.  However, weekly operating meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes proposed.  Our employees also participate in individualized computer based safety training. We strive to constantly improve our safety program."
