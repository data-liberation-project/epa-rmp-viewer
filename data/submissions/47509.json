      "SummaryText": "1.0 Facility Description\n\nShell?s Freeze Wall Test (FWT), located in northwestern Colorado?s Piceance Basin (approximately 60 miles North and West of Rifle Colorado), is a research project designed to test the robustness of freeze wall technology, and its potential for application to future oil shale development in the area.  \n\nThe freeze wall involves drilling holes around a given area and installing a closed circuit system of pipes that are filled with chilled aqueous ammonia.  Circulating the chilled fluid through the pipes cools the groundwater immediately surrounding the pipes until an underground ice barrier forms around the circumference of the target area.  Water is then pumped out of the isolated zone while groundwater flows around the outside of the freeze wall.  Freeze walls have long been used in the building of tunnels, building foundations and in mining.\n\nThe FWT cooling package is comprised of two main processes, the refrigeration units and the aqua ammonia circulation system.  Three independent modular refrigeration units each utilize a two-stage cascade refrigeration system to chill aqueous ammonia.  The refrigerants used in this process are anhydrous ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2).  \n\nThe aqueous ammonia circulation system is a closed loop piping system in which pumps circulate <30% aqueous ammonia from a Surge Tank, through chillers located in the refrigeration modules, though surface circulation piping, through a pattern of  freeze holes, designed to freeze underground water.  The aqua ammonia then returns to the Surge Tank via circulation piping on the surface.\n\nFWT?s RMP regulated substances, and approximate quantities maintained onsite are:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  30,000 lb\nAqueous Ammonia:  1,500,000 lb\n\n \n2.0 Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Procedures\n\n2.1 Regulatory Requirements\nThe inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the FWT site makes the process subject to the OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management  (PSM) standard.

Trade Secrets\n\n2.2 Industry Practices, Codes, and Standards\nThe design and operation of the FWT?s refrigeration units comply with the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditoning Engineers industry standard ASHRAE 15-2004, ?Safety Standard for Refrigeration Systems?.  This standard is the result of over 80 years of learning and innovation in the refrigeration industry.\n\nASHRAE-15 sets forth requirements and guidance regarding refrigerant selection and quantity, materials of construction, design parameters, relief systems, safety testing, etc.\n\nWhere applicable, Shell has applied other industry standards and best practices from such organizations as the American Petroleum Institute, National Fire Protection Association, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American National Standards Institute, Instrument Society of America, etc.\n\n2.3 Company Policies\nShell?s commitment to the safety is expressed at the highest level by Shell?s Golden Rules:\n\n1.  Comply with the law, standards and procedures\n2.  Intervene on unsafe or non-compliant actions\n3.  Respect our neighbors\n\nThe Rules provide a framework for how Shell?s employees and contractors must behave all the time, in every operation and activity.\n\nNumerous more focused Shell safety requirements have also been applied in the design, construction, and operation of the FWT, including (but not limited to):\n\n-    Shell EP Safe Practice"
