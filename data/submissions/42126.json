Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\nPreferred Foods, Inc. /a.k.a. Koch Foods, recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment. The safety and health of all personnel are highest priority. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish Preferred Foods, Inc.'s goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes governmental mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and practices that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of Preferred Foods, Inc.'s Safety Program is to achieve maximum safety performance, as individuals as well as a highly efficient manufacturing team.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with Preferred Foods Inc.'s Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program.  These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68).

As a whole these programs are designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injures and illnesses, and any physical property damage.\r\n\r\nB. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility operates a [NAICS #311991 (Perishable Prepared Food Manufacturer)] perishable meat manufacturing plant and freezer warehouse at 4100 Port Union Road, Fairfield, OH 45014.  A two-stage ammonia refrigeration plant is employed to freeze the manufactured product, maintain the storage, and holding freezer's temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates a two stage (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, which provides general cooling throughout the facility. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7) contained in this refrigeration system is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds to initiate OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan.  Preferred Foods Inc.'s maximum inventory in the refrigeration system is 27,000 pounds.  Due to the volume of ammonia and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, which could pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.
