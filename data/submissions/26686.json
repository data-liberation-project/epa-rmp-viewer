Excellence in health, safety and environmental protection is essential to our continued success and is, therefor a shared responsibility and a common goal for all Shieldalloy Metallurgical employees.\nOur Environmental Health and Safety Policy reaffirms this.\n\n\nFacility and regulated substances handled\nThe facility is located in a mostly rural area between the cities of Byesville (to the south) and Cambridge (to the north).  The facility is approximately 1 miles south of Interstate 70 on State Route 209 (Southgate Road) situated directly north of State Route 209.  The property encompasses approximately 245 acres and contains numerous buildings and paved access areas.  Approximately 75 percent of the property is not used for industrial operations and remains undeveloped wetlands and forest.\n\nTwo distinct operations occur at the facility, ferrous and non-ferrous metal products, and vanadium chemical production. Metal products include vanadium alloys and co-products include iron-nickel-molybdenum slabs and calcium aluminate slag conditioner (Revan?).  \n\nOne raw material used in the manufacture of vanadium alloys is spent petroleum catalyst obtained from hydrotreating, hydrorefining, and hydrocracking refining processes. Hydrotreating and hydrorefining catalysts are regulated as hazardous wastes by EPA; therefor the facility is regulated as a Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF).\n\nChemical production occurs in a separate building located between the main facility and State Route 209. Chemical production consists of the manufacture of vanadium oxytrichloride and vanadium tetrachloride and small quantities of vanadium chemicals such as sodium metavanadate. In the manufactu"

At any given point in time approximately 10 cylinders of chlorine are stored at the facility. Both the worst case and alternative scenarios involve these chlorine cylinders.\n\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a one ton cylinder of chlorine. In an extremely unlikely scenario, the chlorine cylinder is damaged either from falling off of a transport vehicle, a collision of some sort, or a total failure of the cylinder valve mechanism. The entire contents of the cylinder, one ton (2000 pounds) is released in approximately 10 minutes.\n\nThe chlorine monitor in this area would immediately alarm, alerting operating personnel of a leak in this area. The existing emergency procedures would be followed to alert the local authorities.\n\nThe computer software provided by EPA, RMP*Comp, version 1.07 was used to perform the off-site consequence analysis for the Worst-case release scenario. It assumed a release of the entire contents of one cylinder in ten minutes (200 pounds per hour) It would impact an area 3.0 miles in radius from the chemical plant.\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenario\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release at the feed station, where chlorine from the cylinders is feed into a piping manifold, which transfers chlorine into the reactor vessel. In this scenario this ? inch diameter pipe fails by some mechanical means, resulting in a ? diameter ?hole? by which chlorine would be released. \n\nThe chlorine monitor in this area would immediately alarm, alerting operating personnel of a leak in this area. Personnel would close the cylinder valve thereby stopping the release. The"

It calculated a release rate of 112 pounds per minute based on a ? inch hole in the pipe at 150 PSI at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

We expect our employees to work safely to eliminate accidents and emergencies.  An emergency is defined in this program as a fire, explosion, accident, or a spill or release of a hazardous material, which may result in injury to one or more persons, or result in contamination to the local environment.

The County Dispatcher will contact the ambulance company for injuries; and contact the fire department or the sheriff for fire, explosion, and/or release of chemical.  On day shift, the administrative assistant or replacement will contact the designated Emergency Coordinator (EC).\n\n3.

Emergency notification in the Mill is through a whistle alarm. The Yard Service and Maintenance departments have localized alarms in their respective departments.  The Roaster uses radios to communicate an emergency.  The Chemical Plant uses a red emergency wall switch plus radios.\n\n7.
