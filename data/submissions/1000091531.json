The OCA was conducted in accordance with the requirements of EPA's Chemical Accidental Release Prevention Regulations found at 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nSeatex will manufacture liquid fertilizer in batch reactors; the covered process of ammonium phosphate production uses anhydrous ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 15,000-gallon tank.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.25 defines a worst-case scenario as the maximum quantity of the stored material released in 10 minutes, assuming no passive mitigation exists. The worst-case scenario will result in the largest distance to an endpoint specified in the 40 CFR Part 68 Appendix A.\n\n\n\nThe EPA-approved model, RMP*COMP, was used to model the worst case and alternate case scenarios to determine the distances to end-point concentrations. The end-point concentration for anhydrous ammonia is 0.14 mg/L, as specified in Appendix A, 40 CFR 68. 40 CFR 68.25(a)(2) specifies a worst-case scenario as the maximum quantity of the stored material that is released in 10 minutes, assuming no preventive and active mitigation exists. Following this guidance, the worst-case scenario distances to end point were determined.\n\n\n\nThe alternative case scenarios were also modeled based on the upper flow rate tolerance of the transfer line automatic shut-off valve. This means that a fracture with an equivalent diameter of up to 2.15 inches could occur without causing the valve to automatically shut-off. With these assumptions, the alternate case distances to end point were determined.\n\n\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThis document was prepared in accordance with the EPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions 40 CFR Part 68, in particular, Subpart B Hazard Assessment, 40 CFR 68.20-42.

The following is a description of the release scenarios and the meteorological data used in the modeling.\n\n\n\n2.1 Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe regulations require consideration of worst-case assumptions and allow no credit for preventive and active mitigation measures. The following discussion assumes the entire contents, 15,000 gallons (79,300 pounds) of the anhydrous ammonia tank released instantaneously. The discussions below, therefore, follow regulatory guidance and disregard any in-place safety measures.\n\n\n\nThe storage tank stores anhydrous ammonia under pressure. Anhydrous ammonia, with a boiling point of -28.03?F, is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure. The worst-case scenario models the instantaneous loss of the entire contents, 15,000 gallons of the anhydrous ammonia stored. Following EPA guidance on the worst-case OCA, the anhydrous ammonia is released at ground level as a vapor.\n\n\n\n?68.22 specifies that t"

EHS Insight also utilizes applications covering management of change and corrective actions.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n5.2 Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Seatex 239 facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Seatex 239 facility primarily uses the Management of Change and the Job Safety Analysis (JSA) for evaluating potential hazards. These evaluations provide  Operators and Supervisors with an understanding of the processes and logistics in production.

In addition, procedures include key process parameters and guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available in the facility for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. Refer to the Seatex PSM Manual.\n\n\n\n5.4 Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Seatex has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. An experienced operator will mentor new employees with blending operations, truck charging or discharging, and drum and tote filling. In addition, all operators periodically train on the operating procedures, MOCs, JSAs and Lessons Learned from incidents or near misses.
