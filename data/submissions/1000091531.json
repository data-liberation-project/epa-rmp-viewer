The OCA was conducted in accordance with the requirements of EPA's Chemical Accidental Release Prevention Regulations found at 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nSeatex will manufacture liquid fertilizer in batch reactors; the covered process of ammonium phosphate production uses anhydrous ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 15,000-gallon tank.\r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.25 defines a worst-case scenario as the maximum quantity of the stored material released in 10 minutes, assuming no passive mitigation exists. The worst-case scenario will result in the largest distance to an endpoint specified in the 40 CFR Part 68 Appendix A.\r\n\r\nThe EPA-approved model, RMP*COMP, was used to model the worst case and alternate case scenarios to determine the distances to end-point concentrations. The end-point concentration for anhydrous ammonia is 0.14 mg/L, as specified in Appendix A, 40 CFR 68. 40 CFR 68.25(a)(2) specifies a worst-case scenario as the maximum quantity of the stored material that is released in 10 minutes, assuming no preventive and active mitigation exists. Following this guidance, the worst-case scenario distances to end point were determined.\r\n\r\nThe alternative case scenarios were also modeled based on the upper flow rate tolerance of the transfer line automatic shut-off valve. This means that a fracture with an equivalent diameter of up to 2.15 inches could occur without causing the valve to automatically shut-off.

A fertilizer manufacturing unit adjacent to the existing facility at 239 Highway 36, Rosenberg, Fort Bend County, Texas is under construction. Ammonium phosphate will be produced using anhydrous ammonia in this new manufacturing unit. Certain measures to protect human health and the environment are specified for the equipment and in the standard operating procedures. This report summarizes the results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) performed for the worst-case and alternate accidental release scenarios for the covered processes.\r\n\r\nSeatex will manufacture liquid fertilizer in batch reactors; the covered process of ammonium phosphate production uses anhydrous ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 15,000-gallon pressure tank.\r\n\r\n2.0 DESCRIPTION OF RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative-case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia storage tank were determined in accordance with \u00a768.25 and 68.28, respectively. The following is a description of the release scenarios and the meteorological data used in the modeling.\r\n\r\n2.1 Worst-Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe regulations require consideration of worst-case assumptions and allow no credit for preventive and active mitigation measures. The following discussion assumes the entire contents, 15,000 gallons (79,300 pounds) of the anhydrous ammonia tank released instantaneously. The discussions below, therefore, follow regulatory guidance and disregard any in-place safety measures.\r\n\r\nThe storage tank stores anhydrous ammonia under pressure. Anhydrous ammonia, with a boiling point of -28.03\u00b0F, is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure. The worst-case scenario models the instantaneous loss of the entire contents, 15,000 gallons of the anhydrous ammonia stored. Following EPA guidance on the worst-case OCA, the anhydrous ammonia is released at ground level as a vapor.\r\n\r\n\u00a768.22 specifies that t"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Seatex 239 facility primarily uses the Management of Change and the Job Safety Analysis (JSA) for evaluating potential hazards. These evaluations provide  Operators and Supervisors with an understanding of the processes and logistics in production. The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards and develops a plan to mitigate those risks. The JSA uses a color-coded risk ranking for potential accident scenarios: red for highest risk; orange for significant risk and yellow for low risk that calls for caution.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Seatex incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. Refer to the Seatex PSM Manual.\r\n\r\n5.6 Management of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nSeatex has implemented an MOC process to cover operational and process changes as the result of plant expansions. Employees (operators), supervisors, EHSS, and leadership continue to review equipment upgrades and the processes for streamlining production. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment and facility information, as well as procedures, are updated"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. Maintenance reviews and verifies the soundness of construction in accordance with design specifications and mechanical / electrical codes. The MOC underpins the PSSR with field verification of process equipment and procedures essential in implementing related safeguards.\r\n\r\n5.8 Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nA compliance audit addressing all OSHA PSM and EPA RMP requirements is conducted at least every three years. The audit team documents findings, develops recommendations, and provides the overall results to facility management in a written report. All corrective actions are tracked until they are completed, and the two most recent audit reports are retained at the facility in EHS Insight. Refer to the Seatex PSM Manual.\r\n\r\n5.9 Third-Party Audits\r\n\r\nIn the event of a release of ammonia that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury, as required by RMP regulations, Seatex will retain the services of a third-party to complete the next scheduled compliance audit as required by 40 CFR 68.80. Refer to the Seatex PSM Manual.\r\n\r\n5.10 Incident investigation\r\n\r\nSeatex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. Most important, Seatex conducts investigations of significant near misses that could potentially result in a major event. The goal of each investigation is to determine the causes of the incident and develop corrective actions. The investigation team docume"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) in the form of Lessons Learned delivered in the monthly safety training. Incident investigation reports are retained in the EHS Insight Management System for future reference when reviewing past events or expanding operations to ensure that similar events and near misses do not occur.\r\n\r\n5.11 Employee Participation\r\n\r\nSeatex Operators participate in all aspects of Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating operating procedures and other documents to participating in the industrial hygiene program aimed at evaluating potential exposures to hazardous chemical. Industrial hygiene reports have documented best practices and enhancements to lower and eliminate potential exposures. These reports chronicle the lessons learned and continual improvements implemented by Operations. Employees are informed of their potential exposures when using personal protection, best practices and engineering controls.\r\n\r\n5.12 Hot Work Permit\r\n\r\nMetal cutting, grinding, oxygen-fuel gas cutting, brazing, and welding are considered \"hot work\". Any time hot work is to be performed on or near a covered process, a written hot work permit must be generated by either employees or outside contractors, as required under Occupational Health & Safety Administration (OSHA) 1910.119(k). All Hot Work Permits must be reviewed, approved and closed out by the PSM/RMP Coordinator or Director or above, to ensure understanding of work to be completed.
