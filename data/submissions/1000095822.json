While the design of the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, safe handling procedures, maintaining mechanical integrity, and appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to safety at our facility. Ajinomoto Foods has implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with the regulations stipulated by Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) ?1910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the emergency action plan, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions of OAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\nAjinomoto Foods is a frozen food manufacturing facility that processes, stores, and distributes frozen ready-to-eat foods. Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods, and Ajinomoto Foods uses ammonia as the refrigerant. Access to the facility is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nHazard Assessment/Off Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Ajinomoto Foods facility.\n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAjinomoto Foods' written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work perm"

This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every three years, and updated as necessary by Ajinomoto Foods. Training is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating the refrigeration system understands the refrigeration process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only qualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the Ajinomoto Foods facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program\n\nAjinomoto Foods has a written emergency action plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the provisions of Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OR-OSHA) emergency planning requirements in OAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been provided to and reviewed with Portland Fire and Rescue. The approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Ajinomoto Foods and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, Ajinomoto Foods has trained personnel to immediately notify Portland Fire and Rescue and take defensive actions to mitigate the release. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release.  All Ajinomoto Foods personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an eme"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAjinomoto Foods expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of its PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations from Process Hazard Analyses and compliance audits were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Ajinomoto Foods evaluates each PHA and compliance audit recommendation in a timely manner and implements, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.\n\n"
