      "SummaryText": "The Town of Yadkinville Waste Water Treatment Plant (  WWTP ) cleans used water and sewage so it can be returned safely to the environment. The WWTP uses chlorine ( CL2 ) to disinfect the used water and sewer. We also use sulfur-dioxide ( SO2 ) to dechlorinate the water at the end of the process. The facility is located on a plot of approximately five acres. Buildings and equipment consists of a automatic bar screen, grit classifier, lift stations, oxidation ditch, airation basin, three clarifiers, chlorine contact chamber, dechlorination chamber, and two sludge digesters. Enclosed structures consist of a lab, maintenance building, three blower buildings, chlorine and sulfur-dioxide chemical room. The Town of Yadkinville started using ton cylinders of CL2 and SO2 in June 1998 after the plant was expanded to treat more used water and sewage. A concrete storage platform, open on all sides with an overhead roof, is used to store the ton cylinders of CL2 and SO2. It has a storage capacity of eight ton cylinders but only six are stored at any given time. We have two CL2 cylinders and two SO2 cylinders connected to the gas supply but only one each is used at any given time on demand. The other CL2 cylinder and SO2 cylinder are kept with steel hoods covering the valve until they are needed.\n  The WWTP complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Other safety rules and regulations are listed and explained in the Employee Safety manual which is given to each new employee. Each new employee signs a document stating he/she read and understood the manual. The employees at the WWTP plant do daily,weekly,monthly,and annual inspections and maintence on the chemical equipment. The list of procedures and what is checked and maintained is found in the Process Safety manual under maintenance procedures. With the use of our PSM program, proper operating and maintence procedures, knowledge of the chemical being used and proper training we hope to prevent a release."

With the use of our Process Safety program, proper operating procedures, proper maintenance procedures, knowledge of the dangers and consequences of the chemicals used and proper training we hope to avoid any type of accidental release, small or large. We also have several safety policies which are stated throughout our Process Safety and Employee Safety manuals that if followed will aid in avoiding an accident of any type. The Town Safety Director schedules safety training classes. We have classroom and on site training. If the town or an employee has a safety concern the Safety Committee, which consists of a employee from each department ( streets, water/sewer operations, sewer plant, water plant etc. ) meets and discusses the issue. If needed they will implement a new procedure or safety policy. \n  In case of an emergency the operator on duty will call 911. The operator will describe what type of emergency exists, if possible. The employees of the WWTP are to meet at the top of the hill at the entrance gate to the plant if there is an emergency situation. There are two positive air flow respirator hoods and three NIOSH/MSHA breathing apparatus ( for escape only ) located at different locations around the plant. The ranking emergency official on the scene will assume control and determine if there is a hazard to human health or the enviroment. All rescue and medical duties will be handled by emergency services personnel. \n  The Town of Yadkinville Safety Director has coordinated with the Yadkin County EMS Director in case of an accidental release. The Safety Director has given the EMS Director the town's emergency procedures, in turn, the EMS Director has given the Safety Director the county's emergency procedures for hazardous materials. If there is an accidental release the EMS Director or the ranking emergency official will take"
