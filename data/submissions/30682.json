The Sanitation Services Representative administers the district's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections of the district's two locations to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nCrestline Sanitation District has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the Crestline Sanitation District Emergency Response Team.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, Crestline Sanitation District has chosen to maintain a team that will handle releases of chlorine.   The Emergency Response Team is trained to respond in a timely manner to chlorine releases.  Their mitigation efforts will stop a chlorine release prior to exceeding a maximum of 10 pounds of chlorine.  In the event of a chlorine leak, operators are trained to retreat and to call the Crestline Sanitation District Emergency Response Team.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Crestline Sanitation District was formed on January 21, 1946 to provide sewer service to the Lake Gregory area of California.  The District\u00bfs collection system has three lift stations.  These stations pump raw sewage up to higher elevations and allow flow by gravity to the Seeley Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe chlorine systems owned and operated by the Crestline Sanitation District utilize chlorine to disinfect cleaned/treated water prior to discharging (this is also known as final disinfection of the effluent).\n\nOne to"

Before the containers and/or cylinders are accepted, plant operators inspect the containers/cylinders and valves for any signs of leakage or improper alignment of the valves.  Once accepted, the one ton containers are off-loaded utilizing the hoist, placed in special cradles, chained to the floor, dated, and the cylinder identification numbers are recorded on the chlorine inventory forms maintained in the storage room.  \n\nOne ton containers and 150-pound cylinders are connected to the plant chlorine system.  The one ton container is the primary supply while the 150-pound cylinder is placed in \u00bfstandby\u00bf service.  The primary supply of chlorine is via the one ton container.  The 150-pound cylinder will only supply chlorine to the system when the one ton container is exhausted and during change out of the one-ton.\n\nChlorine gas travels (under vacuum) from the container, through the container-mounted regulator, and into an automatic switchover module.  From there the chlorine gas travels (under vacuum) to the gas feed unit, where fixed and paced rotometer units measure out the proper amount of chlorine.  The fixed rotometer is set manually while the paced rotometer is tied to the plant effluent flow meter and increases or decreases with water flow.\n\nChlorine gas then exits the rotometers and enters a hard piped injector.  The injector mixes chlorine gas into the water stream.  As a result, the water contains elevated levels of diluted chlorine.  The chlorine solution is then transferred via piping to the three end-use points where it is mixed with the primary water treatment system.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 2 one-ton containers and 2 150-pound cylinders).\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five year accident history (May 1999 \u00bf May 2004) revealed that there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the applicable Federal Reportable Quanti"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Crestline Sanitation District vigilantly maintains tight control of its chlorine systems through various process controls and monitoring.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the stations fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are multiple mechanisms at each station to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine leak detector, 2) audible/visual leak indicator sirens/lights located outside each plant, and 3) remote alarm monitoring.  If a leak detector senses a chlorine release at 3 ppm inside the chlorine room, a blue visual light is activated, and an alarm signal is simultaneously transmitted to the Plant\u00bfs controls room and the district office. The alarm signal activates an auto dialer system that calls a pre-determined list of District personnel advising them of an alarm after normal working hours.  Upon arrival at the plant the responding operator sees the blue light indicating a chlorine leak, the Crestline Sanitation District Emergency Response Team is notified.  Chlorine alarms occurring after hours and on weekends are transmitted directly to the on call operator.  If the leak occurs during a maintenance activity, operators evacuate the chlorine building and notify the Crestline Sanitation District Emergency Response Team.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCrestline Sanitation District has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety at the Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The annual emergency response drills are documented and mitigation measures to improve the Team\u00bfs response are continuously being reviewed. Crestline Sanitation District has implemented all recommendations from the initial technical studies.\n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their c"
