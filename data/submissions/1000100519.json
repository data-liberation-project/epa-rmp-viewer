(2017)\r\n* Replaced copper coiled tubing with Hastelloy Hoses, as recommended by the Chorine Institute, to connect chlorine rail cars to process piping. (2017)\r\n* Added ejector to evacuate chlorine unloading lines to prevent emissions during railcar switching. (2018)\r\n* Construction of a new building with caustic scrubber where two chlorine railcars are staged when connected to the process.  This significantly mitigates any significant chlorine release that might occur at the connections. (2019)\r\n* Construction of a new staging area where up to 4 railcars are enclosed in a restricted access fenced-in area and under camera monitoring. (2019)\r\n* Purchase and install high-definition camera for flare operation of visible emission monitoring. (2019)\r\n* Replace older slide gate valves in the ZDDP P2S5 feed system with newer models equipped with inflatable seals to reduce H2S leaks (a NJDEP TCPA covered substance).

They also include specific external notification instructions.\r\n\r\nMembers of both staffs are trained in various phases of emergency response procedures.  A separate staff of trained emergency medical technicians is available 24 hours/day and trained medical resources in the Medical Department are staffed about 50 hours/week and available on call 24 hr/day.  Arrangements are in force with Trinitas Hospital to provide medical services at other hours.\r\n\r\nPeriodic meetings are held with the Linden Fire Department (LFD) to coordinate procedures and inform LFD officers about the site.  The LFD Commander, who arrives at the site for any emergency, will be escorted to the scene to communicate with the Bayway Incident Commander, give advice and render an independent judgment of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Plant Shift Team Leaders (STLs) oversee any Chemical plant emergencies until operations management arrives.  Our STLs have been trained to identify incidents that require agency notifications and have the authority to call out the Chemical Plant Emergency Response Organization (ERO).

This system requires that changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and/or to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change and that these changes are properly authorized.  This system also ensures Process Safety Information (PSI) are updated when incorporated into these changes.  In addition, the system ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training before the change is implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe BWCP investigates all Safety and Environmental incidents.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident, or a similar one.  All incident reports are documented and reviewed by the Production Manager and relevant Business Unit Leader.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation are tracked to completion.  Investigation results are reviewed with colleagues and Contract employees who could be affected by the findings.  Reports are retained for at least five years and are reviewed during relevant PHAs.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe BWCP periodically conducts an audit of the accident prevention program and the OIMS to determine whether the procedures and practices of the program are being utilized and are affective.  Self-audits are conducted quarterly, and internal audits may be conducted on an annual basis.  Every four years the BWCP undergoes an extensive, external audit made up of both Infineum colleagues from other sites and ExxonMobil colleagues.  Findings, including follow up items are provided to Plant Management.  Corrective actions taken in response to the findings are tracked to completion and documented.

Inspectors are API 510, 570, and 653 certified, and attend outside training courses to facilitate the implementation of new technology.

The intervals between inspections of these devices are set based on criticality of service and analysis of the historical data.  The list of safety and environmentally critical instrumentation is periodically reviewed to ensure effective coverage.  Monthly reports are generated showing the status of equipment that is scheduled for inspection that month and year-to-date, and any equipment whose inspection may be overdue.\r\n\r\nSemiannual HSSE metrics for each operating area are reviewed with the BWCP Site Operations Integrity Committee (SOIC).

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup and personnel are trained prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review procedure provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the approved Management of Change and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  PSSRs are also conducted on field changes as part of the Management of Change process when PSI is revised.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity/Preventative Maintenance\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Preventive Maintenance and Inspection Program is centered on a computer data base and software called SAP R3.

This training information includes familiarization with the hazards of regulated substances found at the BWCP and the Emergency Response Plan.  Work procedures as prescribed by the HSE manual (e.g., Work Permit System) are also covered.
