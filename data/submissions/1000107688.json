Effective September 1, 2019, the assets of Nexeo Solutions LLC were transferred to Univar USA Inc. and the legal name of Univar USA Inc. changed to Univar Solutions USA Inc. There was no material change in the day-to-day operations and personnel overseeing compliance under the above referenced facility. The purchase of Nexeo Solutions LLC's assets and company name change do not constitute a transfer of ownership for the above referenced facility address.\n\nThis RMP Plan was submitted as a correction on September  21, 2020 t update the facility contact in Section 1.7 and 1.8 due to a change in Operations Manager.\n\nThis RMP Plan was submitted as a resubmission on October 26, 2023 as the 5 year resubmission of the plan.  During this submission, cyclohexylamine was removed from the RMP Plan because on-site inventories and customer forecasts have decreased below the Threshold Quantity."
