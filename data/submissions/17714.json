      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that the City Of Chandler, Public Works Dept. is complying with OSHA/Dept of Labor's Process Safety Management Standard. Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations , Title 40 CFR Part 68, have developed policies, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall worker and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent occurance, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.   Our Safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vesses which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.   Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improves as necessary. They are also communicated to an accepted by all employees at the facility.  The worst case scenario would involve a vehicle or other device striking the ton container and causing a tear in the high pressure container causing it to rupture releasing chlorine rapidly  into the air, causing harm to the personnel and the citizens within 1.5 miles in all directions of the water plant before dispersing into the atmosphere where it would no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst case weather conditions are u"

      "SummaryText": "ncommon; the ton containers are positioned with in a fence compound, and protected by being elevated to a height of 4 ft. and vehicles are not allowed to park and/or move within the area.  All personnel are trained in the proper use and storage of chlorine.    The alternative release scenario would involve failure of the connecting hose leading from the container to the chlorinater inside a enclosed area. Under common weather conditions, chlorine could travel no more than 1.5 miles and would be dissapated in the air before that distance is reached.  The alternative release scenario is unlikely due to fact that all hoses, connectors, and valves are enclosed and checked daily.  There are MSDS sheets are  available within 20 feet of the containers. Personnel are highly trained in all aspect of chlorine and chlorine release.In the event of a release the personnel are take necessary safety precautions, and notify their supervisor(s), and emergency services to respond the the scene with the necessary equipment to deal with the release. The emergency services consist of: the Chandler Fire Department, Police Department, Emergency Management/Safety Department and personnel of the Public Works Department.  It is estimated that the total time from inital release to emergency services responce is 4 min. In the event of a release the Emergency Operations Plan will then take effect to mitigate the situation, and coordinate all activities.  In the event of a release all personnel within the area will be evacuated and moved to the command post. Injuries will be handled by the Chandler Ambulance Service, and Fire Department for decon. This plan is used to ensure the safety of our city personnel and the citizens of the City Of Chandler.  It is also noted that this plan may be updated as needed to keep the information current.   This plan will be on file for all city departments to evaluate or as needed copied to keep in file."
