Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide immediate corrective response to any accidents.\r\nLake Draper WTP staff are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response to accidental releases is also coordinated with the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Lake Draper WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the drinking water treatment process.  \r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and written process safety information have been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand hazards posed by processes involving extremely hazardous chemicals. Process safety information includes chlorine and ammonia information, technology of the process information, and equipment information.\r\nThe City of Oklahoma City Utilities Engineering Division verifies that C"

All employees involved in working with and around the chlorine or ammonia system are trained annually in process and safety procedures, including emergency response.\r\nThe mechanical integrity of chlorine and ammonia process equipment is documented and maintained through maintenance, inspection, and testing programs. In addition, a Management of Change program has been established to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine or ammonia system.\r\nA pre-startup safety review is performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications, procedures and training have been implemented, and hazard analysis recommendations have been resolved.\r\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been implemented. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong RMP is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel. Staff have developed a formal, documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up. Each incident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated, and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP. \r\nLake Draper WTP manageme"

The following elements involve employee participation with the RMP/PSM Plan: \r\n?\tInvolve employees in the hazard review, compliance audits, and RMP/PSM Plan reviews and updates\r\n?\tProvide employee access to the RMP/PSM Plan\r\n?\tPresent an overview of RMP/PSM Plan requirements to staff annually \r\n?\tInvolve employees in development and updating of training\r\n?\tInvolve employees in incident investigations as appropriate\r\nAn authorization and permit program for hot work operations near or around the regulated chlorine or ammonia process has been implemented by the WTP. Contractors performing maintenance or repair on or adjacent to the chlorine or ammonia process are instructed in hazards of materials onsite, and documentation is maintained on contractor understanding of training provided as described in the Plan. Emphasis is placed on knowing how to respond and evacuate in the event of an emergency. The WTP chlorine and ammonia system technology is not confidential and information regarding the process is available for review in the RMP/PSM Plan.\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases within the past 5 years from the covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe RMP Emergency Response Plan for the WTP includes the following elements:\r\n?\tProcedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\r\n?\tDocumentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposures\r\n?\tProcedures and measures for emergency response compliance after a reportable accidental release of a regulated substance\r\n?\tProcedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance\r\n?\tTraining for all employees in relevant procedures"

WTP personnel are trained to take action to control a minor release. Trained responding staff will attempt to control a release within their capability. However, in the event the release is beyond the control of plant staff, they would immediately call 911. \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe WTP planned changes to improve safety include the addition of bollards at chlorine and ammonia fill points, increased signage in process areas, purchasing of additional Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) equipment, and coordinate more robust onsite drills with local responders."
