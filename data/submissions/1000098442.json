Pharmasol is located in an industrial park and is bounded on the north, east, and south by man-made ponds and on the west by other commercial or industrial properties.  There are no adjacent or nearby residential areas or environmental receptors.  There are no adjacent or nearby public receptors, other than commercial buildings to the west in the industrial park.\r\n\r\nPharmasol is committed to complete compliance with all federal, state and local environmental, health and safety statutes and regulations.  The company's objective is to provide a facility and working environment that is as safe, clean and pollution-free as possible for its workers and neighbors.\r\n\r\nPharmasol uses raw materials that pose a major hazard (flammability).  These include gas propellants used to manufacture aerosol products and denatured alcohols used in both aerosol and non-aerosol products.  The propellants: propane, butane, isobutane, and difluoroethane, are regulated substances that may at times be present above the threshold quantities listed under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\r\n\r\nPharmasol has implemented programs to assure compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program standards.  The initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), completed in the fall of 2004, were the basis for preventative maintenance procedures; standard operating procedures to reduce and respond to flammability and explosion hazards; procedures for safe alcohol and propellant deliveries, contractor safety, hot work permits, gas house safety and lockout/tagout; employee safety and hazmat training; and emergency preparation and response. \r\n\r\nPharmasol reviewed, updated and revalidated the PHA/HAZOP in December 2021.
