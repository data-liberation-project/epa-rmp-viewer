The system has equipment both inside and outside of the facility.\r\n\r\nPeracetic acid is onsite and used as an antimicrobial agent in the organic chicken process. It is applied to the chicken via dip tanks, sprays, chillers, and various other methods approved by the USDA. There is one 5,500 gallon tank at the facility. However, the vapor pressure of the peracetic acid is below 10 mmHg @25C; therefore, not subject to the threshold determination and not included in the RMP.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Peracetic Acid are regulated under CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nAccidental  Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very s"
