      "SummaryText": "    LEWISBURG WATER PLANT\n    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nA.  The Lewisburg Water Treatment Plant (LWP) accidental release prevention policy involves a united approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention program are adhered to.  The LWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB.  The LWP chlorination system has been installed to disinfect the flow in the Lewisburg Water System.  The water serves customers in the city of Lewisburg and some county residents. The Plant is located at 830 Old Farmington Road.  The plant includes a chlorination room which contains ton cylinders of liquid chlorine under pressure, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels and instrument room.  The amount of chlorine handled is six (6) one ton cylinders.   The facility is manned 16 hours per day by on-site personnel and computer telemetry monitoring 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\n\nC.  The offsite consequences analysis includes consideration of two (2) chlorine scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\".  The first scenario as defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes\", due to unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to \"the toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is d"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n\n1.  The worst case scenario at the Lewisburg Water Plant involves total loss of a ton cylinder of chlorine during delivery, dropping a one (1) ton cylinder onto concrete from 5 feet shearing the valve.  The offsite worst case consequence analysis for this scenario was performed by EPA's\nRMP COMP Program including worst case scenario for chlorine.  The conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use the one hour average as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint.  EPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, and temperature 77 F.\n\nWhen atomospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed on chlorine using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles (1.4km) an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 3,720 was obtained.\n\n2.  The alternative release scenario involves the leaking valve of one (1) ton chlorine cylinder.  The chlorine released is 1800 pounds at average rate of one hour, of 30 pounds/minute.  Toxic endpoints were obtained using EPA's RMP COMP Program.  The typical meteorological conditions used were stability Class D, wind speed 3 meters/second, average air temperature 77 F. The estimated distances traveled 0.1 miles (0.2 km).\n\nActivation of the two (2) chlorine detectors should be an active mitigation measur"

      "SummaryText": "e covered.  Both chlorine monitors will detect chlorine and give an alarm at 1 ppm and above.  Both monitors are connected to the telemetry system for a remote monitoring system. A fixed chlorine monitor is located in the chlorine cylinder storage room as well as the feed room.  An additional mitigation system installed is the conversion of the existing chorinators to a remote vacuum type, with all pressurized chlorine piping replaced with vacuum piping.  This will almost eliminate chlorine released in case of pigtail rupture.  The vacuum regulator on chlorine cylinders is designed by the manufacturer to automatically shut off flow of gas upon detection of a vacuum leak within the process feed system.\n\nD.  The LWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n     -High element of training of operators.\n     -Preventative maintenance programs\n     -Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n     -Use of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of \n      operators\n     -Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n     -Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, availability of self-contained breathing apparatus(SCBA),and proper training of onsite personnel.\n\nE.  No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nF.  The facility has an emergency response program coordinated with LEPC, Fire Department, and Police Department depending upon the size of the leak, weather conditions, wind speeds and direction.  If advanced level of technical assistance is deemed necessary to control leak, Chemtrec may be called to give advice and assistance via a 24 hour emergency number.  PB & S Chemical has a team that can be activated with a one hour notice 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nG.  We have in place a chlorine emergency action and proce"
