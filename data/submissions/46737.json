The information changed included the following:\n\n     Facility name\n\n     Parent company name\n\n     Facility location address (the facility did not relocate, but the address of the administration building where personnel are located changed).\n\n     The address of the administration building is 2385 Riverport Road, Memphis, TN, 38109\n\n     The person responsible for the RMP implementation \n\n     The emergency contact\n\n     Date of the last safety inspection\n\n\n\nSite Information\n\n\n\nPremcor operates a variety of processes to produce high quality petroleum products from raw crude oil.  All refinery process units are currently managed under the PSM Standard; therefore, these process units are currently managed as RMP Program Level 3 processes.  The refinery has a thoroughly-trained, experienced, safety-motivated workforce that has achieved an outstanding safety record.  The refinery is in full compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\nPremcor has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the time, money, and effort invested in training personnel and promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Safety tools include engineering controls, real time process monitoring, level, pressure, and temperature alarms, leak detection systems, and automatic and manual mitigation systems.

The Memphis/Shelby County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) was the lead agency.  Twelve area companies, numerous federal, state, and local regulatory and emergency response agencies participated in the symposium.  Each company or agency prepared a booth with informational literature and displays.  Persons ready and willing to discuss RMP, safety programs, or answer public questions staffed the booths.  Expert speakers, emergency response equipment, and live demonstrations of Shelter-in-Place and HAZMAT response were also featured.  Approximately 600 people attended the symposium.\n\n\n\nThe refinery has been working with our Community Advisory Panel (CAP), which meets monthly, to identify effective means for communicating RMP/Safety information to our immediate neighboring community.  CAP members have provided many helpful suggestions, and have offered to distribute our RMP-related printed material at various venues in the community.  Premcor and the CAP members agree that RMP/Safety communication should be an ongoing effort.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Results - Identification of Scenarios\n\n\n\nRelease scenario results were estimated using the RMPlanner software published by JBF Associates.

No incident has resulted in offsite effects (deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage) as defined by EPA's RMP guidelines (RMP-covered process and RMP-covered chemicals).

All of these releases were detected and contained within the plant with no off site impact.

This allows the refinery to determine appropriate safety integrity levels (SIL) for the unit on which the HAZOP is being conducted.  This also meets the requirements of ISA S84.01.  By performing a LOPA analysis, the Memphis Refinery is moving ahead of the industry by performing this analysis before it is required by standard.\n\n\n\nAs safety concerns are evaluated, they are rated according to probability and consequence.  \n\nAll concerns are documented as part of the HAZOP process.

The facility maintains a facility siting plan and map.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe refinery has developed and compiled a comprehensive set of operating procedures to provide instruction in the safe operation of refinery processes.  Procedures must provide a reliable and consistent reference for all phases of process operations including 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, 6) initial startup of a new process, 7) emergency operations, and 8) startups following an abnormal or emergency shutdown.\n\n\n\nWriters from each process unit, the laboratory, and the tank farm develop the procedures with input from engineers, supervisors, and other operators.  Before publication each procedure is reviewed by supervisors, engineers, and management for accuracy, consistency, and completeness.  In addition, each procedure is subject to editorial review to ensure readability.  All operating procedures are available through the PSM database and in hard copy.  Each procedure contains procedure steps, operating parameters and limits, safety and health hazard information, safety control measures, and assignment of responsibility for performing the procedure.

This program has resulted in the contractors at this site going 2524 days (as of 9/22/06) without a lost time accident.  The Contractor Safety Program includes the following:\n\n\n\n* Requires contract bidders to provide information on accident rates and the contractor's safety programs.\n\n* Requires the contractor to verify each employee's knowledge of job safety, craft skills, and equipment operation before assignment to onsite work.\n\n* Restricts bid requests to those contractors who have satisfied minimum requirements.  Those requirements include reviewing of their OSHA 300 log, a documented drug screening program, comprehensive \"Safety Action Plan,\" and English fluency for employees performing safety-sensitive work.
