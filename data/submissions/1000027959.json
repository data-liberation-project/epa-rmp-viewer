      "SummaryText": "MillerCoors, LLC operates a brewing and packaging facility in Golden, Colorado (MillerCoors Golden Brewery - MCGB.  This facility uses chlorine and ammonia.  Use of these chemicals is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning regulations (40 CFR, Part 68) herein referred to as the RM regulations.  Under the CAAA and the RM regulations, this facility is considered to be a stationary source.\n\n\n\nThere are 3 processes within the Golden Brewery Business Unit that require a Risk Management Program:\n\n1.    Brewery ammonia refrigeration process\n\n2.    Water plant chlorine disinfection process\n\n3.    Golden Distribution Center ammonia refrigeration process\n\n\n\nThis submittal addresses the EPA regulatory requirements for a RM Plan, which form the basis of the RM program for the MCGB.  \n\n\n\nThis RM plan is summarized below:  \n\n\n\nManagement Plan\n\n\n\nThe facility has a program in place to manage the implementation of the RM program elements.  The program is under continuous review and improvement with the objective to reduce release risk.  The program engages operations personnel through the employee participation process described in the PSM Program Manual.  All changes are subject to rigorous review prior to approval and implementation following the Management of Change Process also described in the PSM Program Manual.  Compliance with program elements is subject to auditing processes.  Corrective actions are implemented to address audit findings. \n\n\n\nThe MCGB EH&S Group Manager is responsible for assuring compliance with RM regulations.  The MCGB Process Safety Leader is responsible for development and implementation of program changes.   The operations units where RM regulations are applicable are responsible for complying with program requirements.  \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\n\n\nPotential accidental releases of ammonia and chlorine were modeled t"

      "SummaryText": "o evaluate possible offsite impacts.  Modeling procedures followed EPA guidance to identify worst case release scenarios (WCS) and alternate case release scenarios (ACS) as defined by the RM regulations to determine toxic endpoints.  The WCSs were identified by comparing the results for each ammonia and chlorine system and selecting the scenario that resulted in the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The number of offsite permanent residents located inside a circle (centered on the release point with a radius equal to the endpoint) was then estimated using EPA RMP*Comp version 1.07 software .  \n\n\n\nA release of 87,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes was identified as the WCS for the brewery ammonia refrigeration process.  This WCS would produce an endpoint (defined as 200 parts per million [ppm] ammonia) of 5.4 miles.  An estimated offsite population of 89,700 is located within this radius.  \n\n\n\nIn the past five years, none of the processes subject to RM regulations has had releases that have resulted in offsite property damage or offsite health consequences requiring medical treatment for chemical releases.\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention programs for the covered processes were developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119).\n\n\n\nFor the covered processes (which are subject to the PSM standard), EPA requires a Program 3 prevention program with 12 specific elements as listed below and described in Section 3.0:\n\n\n\n1.    Employee Participation\n\n2.    Process Safety Information\n\n3.    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n4.    Operating Procedures\n\n5.    Contractors\n\n6.    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n7.

Security sends a trained officer to the scene to assess the situation, act as the initial Incident Commander, and engage the proper internal and external emergency response personnel and equipment in accordance with National Incident Management System (NIMS) requirements and guidelines.  When external emergency responders are needed, a joint command is then established which is led by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) and supported by CBC personnel.  The AHJ can call additional external emergency response resources to the scene including City of Golden Fire Department, Fairmont Fire Department, West Metro Fire Department, the Jefferson County Sheriff, Colorado State Patrol, Jefferson/Adams County HAZMAT Team, and other agencies, as needed."
