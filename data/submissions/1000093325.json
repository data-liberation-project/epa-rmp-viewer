      "SummaryText": "Alabama Power Company's J.H. Miller Electric Generating Plant (Plant Miller) is located near Porter, Alabama, and consists of four (4) steam electric generating units.\n\n\n\nPlant Miller has a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system at each of the 4 units to control the emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from burning coal to produce electricity. As part of the system, vaporous ammonia is injected into the flue gas and aids in the chemical reaction to convert NOx to harmless nitrogen and water vapor.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks on the plant site for use in the SCR system.  There is additional anhydrous ammonia stored in rail-cars on the plant site used for re-filling the 4 anhydrous ammonia tanks. The total quantity of ammonia on-site in a single process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The main hazard that would be associated with anhydrous ammonia at Plant Miller is a toxic hazard. EPA's RMP COMP was used to determine the distance to the end-point for an anhydrous ammonia worst case scenario release (a total tank anhydrous ammonia release from the largest single storage vessel on-site). The storage tanks are protected from traffic around the plant by bollards installed around the tanks. Trained plant operations personnel conduct the unloading of anhydrous ammonia from the rail cars into the storage tanks. Therefore, a rupture that would result in the rapid release of the gas is unlikely.\n\n\n\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) program under OSHA is in effect for Plant Miller, therefore Program 3 applies.  \n\n\n\nPlant Miller has established environmental, health and safety programs designed to ensure that a safe working environment is maintained for all employees.  The accidental release prevention program at Plant Miller is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility of the indiv"

Additional steps include: accessibility, ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing standard operating and preventive maintenance procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and ensuring periodic compliance audits and incident investigations are conducted including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.  \n\n\n\nPlant Miller is included in the Birmingham/Jefferson County LEPC emergency response plan.  In addition, the plant has in place an emergency action plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The procedures cover the following: evacuation plan, recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities and documenting releases; emergency alarm systems; training; and pre-emergency coordination with the Jefferson County LEPC.\n\n"
