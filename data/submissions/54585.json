If an emergency were to occur, it is KNCs policy to notify\nCrawfordsville Fire Department or the Montgomery County Sheriffs Office.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: The Koch Nitrogen Company, LLC -\nCrawfordsville Ammonia Terminal stores and distrubutes anhydrous ammonia from one 200 ton bullet tank\n(400,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia). The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is\n400,000 pounds.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: The facility\ncomplies with EPAs chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and\nregulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29\nCFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\nFive-year accident history: On April 10, 2006, an operations tech was exposed to an accidental release of\nanhydrous ammonia. The contractor sustained chemical burns to his face and neck and was sent to the\nhospital for treatment. Approximately one pound of anhydrous ammonia was released during the incident.\nThe cause of the release from a pilot valve was attributed to improper procedure and human error. As a\nresult of the incident, KNC modified maintenance procedures and adopted a lockout/tagout protocol for this\nmaintenance activity. The previous RMP was updated in October 2006 as required by 40 CFR 68.42\nregulations.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it\nis the facilitys policy to notify the Montgomery County Emergency Management Agency and request that\nthey respond to the emergency.
