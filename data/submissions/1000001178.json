It is Otto & Sons policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).

      "SummaryText": "y Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\nAlthough ammonia is a listed toxic substance, it is also a ubiquitous material, which is used by farmers for fertilizer. Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125 Exemptions \u00c2\u00bf Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68).\n\nIII.\tFacility Identification\nThe Otto & Sons facility is located at 4545 South Racine Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. The facility processes ready to cook and fully cooked bacon and processes and packages chili, beans and other kettle cooked specialties. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one RMP regulated refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. The system originally contained a charge of 21,000 pounds of ammonia.  The amount of ammonia currently present in this refrigeration system is approximately 26,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. An area map is included as Appendix B. \n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u00c2\u00bf Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\nThe toxic endpoint distance is 1.5 miles for the worst case scenario. Based upon year 2000 census data, the population within a radius of 1.5 miles is 58,317.\n\nV. \tHazard Assessment \u00c2\u00bf Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit"
