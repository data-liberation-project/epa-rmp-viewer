The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of Sun Ag Inc.- Hudson are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by\nutilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, and maintenance and training of all\npersons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has\norientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they\ncan plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to\nfarmers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as\na crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 120,000 pounds in\nthe facility's one tank.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the\nstorage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n2000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as\nlimited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of\ndispersion based on the model used is 2 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 180\ninch transfer hose, with 40 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint\nof dispersion is .32 miles. \n\n4.  The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations\nrelating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions,\nEquipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the\nIllinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 AND OSHA 29 CFR\n1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The five-year accident history: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous\nammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have c"
