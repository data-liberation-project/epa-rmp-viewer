To strive for a coordinated and affective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.

A follow-up report of the audit is created to address any recommendation to improve any program elements.  A process hazard analysis has been done for the entire system, and the hazard analysis will be repeated every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated and all recommendations from the hazard analysis are addressed to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Price Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility intent that the PSM/RMP for the facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  It is expected that by following the work practices that are implemented at the facility only incidental released of ammonia will occur due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear. \n\nThis facility is used for the storage of fruits, using ammonia as the refrigerant for the cold storage rooms.\n\n\n\nRelease Considerations\n\nFollowing program guidelines a \"Worse Case\" release of ammonia was analyzed.

If an actual release occurs or even a near miss, an incident investigation is done to determine the cause, and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\nPrice Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility has a written \"Emergency Action Plan\" that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release.  Company personnel have been trained in notification and evacuation procedures.  The refrigeration operators will do only \"defensive\" actions to control and contain an ammonia release as much as possible without endangering themselves.  Price Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility has also coordinated with the Yakima County LEPC and with the local emergency responders (Gleed Fire Department).\n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Improvement\n\nPrice Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility holds quarterly safety committee meetings with all Management representatives where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment.  There is also a regular staff meeting for all staff supervisors.  Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety and operational improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon.
