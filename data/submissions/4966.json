      "SummaryText": "CITY OF ST. AUGUSTINE\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe management of the water facility is a complex operation which includes a number of programs all directed toward continuous, uninterrupted treatment of the community's water supply to the degree required by regulatory agencies.  If the supervisor and staff understand how an emergency can affect the water facility, and employees understand and are aware of their responsibilities in an emergency, its adverse effects can be eliminated or at least kept to a minimum. Procedures are described in the form of temporary and indefinite period shutdowns and alternate operating procedures which should help plant personnel cope with these emergencies. \n\nAll water facilities experience such common problems as equipment breakdown, leaking pipes, plugged pipes, variations in the volume and quality of the water supply, etc.  The effects of these common problems may be cumulative, and they will affect the operation of the facility, if the necessary repairs or adjustments are not made.  However, the effects of these problems are different, in many respects, from those caused by a natural disaster or civil disorder.  Natural disasters, such as tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and extreme cold, can cause emergencies for which the operations manager can prepare, but one cannot also overlook the increasing frequency of civil disorders like vandalism, sabotage, and riots, even outside of metropolitan areas.  No matter how well the facility is designed and operated, the potential for an emergency is always present.\n\nAlthough natural disasters fall into many classifications and are obviously different from civil disorders, the potential damage to the facility is similar for most of these events.  Emergency operating plans that can be developed to cope with disasters have a common concern: damage assessment and emergency response to the damage to maintain the best facility operation possible.  To assist with meeting this goal, "

      "SummaryText": "the treatment facility has developed procedures for responding to emergencies including a vulnerability analysis, hazardous chemical inventory, emergency notification, worst case scenarios, accidental releases and emergency response programs.\n\nPolicy Statement\n\nThe City of St. Augustine's major objective in developing a process safety management program for highly hazardous chemicals was to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals especially into locations, which could expose employees and others to serious hazards. An effective process safety management program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the process are all addressed in the City's Process Safety Management program. The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals was evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program is a proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program targets highly hazardous chemicals that have the potential to cause a catastrophic incident. This program as a whole is designed to aid the City in its efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace and possibly to the surrounding community. To control these types of hazards, the City has attained the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety management progra"

The City, who merged the two sets of requirements into their process safety management program, will better assure full compliance with each as well as enhancing their relationship with the local community. \n\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe St. Augustine Water Treatment Plant was desined to meet the stringent water quality requirements of today and of the near future.  An Operation and Maintenance Manual has been prepared to provide understanding and guidance in the operation and maintenance of the St. Augustine facility.  Its purpose is to provide the data needed by the plant personnel to obtain and maintain effective and efficient treatment of the community's water.\n\nProper operation of the facilities is obtained by understanding, monitoring, and controlling the equipment and the treatment processes.  Toward this end, descriptions and functions of the equipment are detailed; operational procedures and laboratory controls are specified; and preventive maintenance data is provided.\n\nEquipment failure is likely at any time during the operation of a water facility.  Equipment failure during an emergency compounds the problem.  Various protective measures include mutual aid agreements for spare parts, equipment, and supplies and an evaluation of specialized assistance available from sanitary engineers, - chemists, maintenance experts, and other operators.  Equipment failure response scenarios for the plant's process facilities are provided for in the facility's Operation and Maintenance Manuals.\n\nGeneral Information on Chlorine:\n\nCHLORINE is a greenish-yellow gas with a bleach-like choking odor and is a chemical element used in the manufacture of solvents, insecticides, bleaching of paper, pulp and fabrics, disinfecting and water purification.\nFIRE DATA:  May ignite other combustibles.

Containers may explode in heat of fire.  Reacts explosively or forms explosive compounds with acetylene, turpentine, ether, ammonia, fuels, hydrogen and finely divided metals.\nREACTIVE DATA:  When mixed with ammonia will form a lethal gas.  When mixed with water will form a corrosive acid (HC1). Will react at high temperatures with metals. Copper will burn spontaneously.\nStrong oxidizer.\nNEUTRALIZING AGENTS:\nChlorine can be absorbed into an alkaline solution, i.e., caustic soda, caustic potash, lime, etc.\n\nChlorine gas is contained in 2,000 pound steel cylinders that is stored at the facility, located in the northern section of the plant.  Any leak of chlorine is very dangerous to personnel and to the environment.  Caution should always be exercised when handling either chlorine or ammonia equipment. A complete guide to the use, storage and operating procedures is described in the facility's Process Safety Management, Manual of Practice and the facility's Operation and Maintenance Manual.\n\nThe St. Augustine Water Treatment Facility must be viewed as a dynamic means of collecting, treating, and discharging water that meets regulatory agency requirements, regardless of conditions.  Significant operating differences are encountered under extreme emergency conditions resulting from a tornado, a flood, or a serious civil disorder or other disaster. It is toward these circumstances that a vulnerability assessment is directed.\n\nThe water and conveyance system -- in terms of fixed or physical facilities -- can be described by:\n\nRaw water collection system\nTreatment facilities\nDistribution System\n\nEach of these facilities is complex, including hundreds or even thousands of individual components.  However, to spend money on any physical facility is of no use to the City without achieving acceptable treatment of water. Eve"

Proper operation requires:\n\nTrained personnel\nPower\nMaterials and supplies\nCommunications\n\nManagers and operators must understand both the strengths and weaknesses of an individual system in relation to specific anticipated or design emergencies before attempting to draft emergency operational plans.  In considering an emergency or disaster at a water facility, several additional aspects are involved: \n\nDetermining the status of the system following the disaster\nEstablishing immediate recovery objectives\nDesigning a feasible plan for achieving objectives \nImplementing the plan of action\nCoordinating activities\n\nMaking decisions is an essential part of the total process.  An important role of an emergency plan is to reduce the number of decisions that must be made under emergency conditions by providing for orderly initiation and implementation of predetermined remedial and restoration measures.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Senarios\n\nThe City of St. Augustine has implemented changes in the chlorination system to prevent catastrophic spills from occurring.  The current system is capable of releasing 2,000 pounds of chlorine during a major spill.  The probability of this occurring is low as determined by the St. Johns County Emergency Management Plan for Hazardous Material. The system is constantly monitored by chlorine gas detectors inside the process building and at the outside storage area.  These monitors have an audible alarm as well as being connected to the facility's telemetry system.\n\nThe area of impact or vulnerability zone of these chemicals in case of a spill has been calculated using the USEPA RMP Submit program.  The areas of concern in a worst case scenario includes an area of 0.9 miles in diameter effecting an estimated population of 3,634.
