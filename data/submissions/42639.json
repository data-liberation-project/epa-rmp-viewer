      "SummaryText": "The Department of Public Works for the City of Frederick, Maryland operates a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the southeastern area of the City.  Wastewater from the City and nearby Walkersville, Maryland is received and treated at the facility.  The Walkersville, Maryland wastewater is treated with a minimal amount of chlorine and subsequently directed to the wastewater treatment plant for Frederick County (Ballenger Creek WWTP).  The City wastewater is treated through a series of settling basins, clarifiers, sand filters, chemical treatments and post-aeration before being discharged to the Monocacy River.  Based on an assessment of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems used at the facility (chlorine storage greater than 2,500 pounds and sulfur dioxide storage greater than 5,000 pounds), the WWTP is required under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to develop and implement aRisk Management Plan (RMPlan).  The chlorine treatment system consists of eight (8) 1-ton containers (four (4) in use, four (4) as backup).  Similarly, the sulfur dioxide treatment system consists of six (6) 1-ton containers (three (3) in use, three (3) as backup).  The City operates the chemical treatment systems in accordance with standard industry practices and monitors the performance of each system on a regular basis.  The safety of all WWTP operations are continually reviewed and improved through an internal safety committee that meets at a minimum on a quarterly basis.  It is the policy of the City of Frederick to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nUSEPA?s RMPlan provisions are intended to have facilities 1) prepare for and prevent the potential for a catastrophic release or explosion and 2) coordinate emergency response activities both internally and externally with local emergency planning officials.  The likelihood of the worst-case release described in this plan is very lo"

However, should such an event occur, the City WWTP will follow the contents of this plan in response to the emergency or potential emergency.\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68, facilities are required to comply with the RMPlan requirements for re-submittal of their plan within 5-years after their initial submittal.  Our re-submittal is due on May 19, 2005.  Compliance with this rule includes an electronic submittal to USEPA of required data elements using EPA?s RMP*Submit 2004 software.  The RMPlan and the data elements required in the submittal were developed based on USEPA?s guidance documents including: RMP*Submit 2004 User?s Manual:  Accidental Release Prevention Requirement; Risk Management Program Requirement Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7); Amendments to the Submission Schedule and Data Requirements:  A Checklist for Resubmitting Your Risk Management Plan (RMP) For Chemical Accident Prevention.\n\nAfter determining that the chlorine and sulfur dioxide treatment systems were applicable processes, the City WWTP performed a program applicably assessment to determine the specific RMP requirements for the chemical treatment systems.  This assessment is dependent on the following four factors.\n\n1)    Five-Year Accident History:  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems have never had an accidental release since they were installed in 1987.\n2)    SIC Code of the Facility:  The facilities SIC Code is 4952, sewerage systems.\n3)    Applicability of OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulations:  The treatment process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard outlines in 29 CFR 1910.119.  Since the worse case analysis identified impacted offsite public receptors and the facility is subject to OSHA?s PSM regulations, the treatment processes are subject to Risk Management Program 3.\n\nThe City of Frederick has also ensured that the facility is in compliance with the elements required under Prevention Program 3.  These requirements include implementing an emergency management sy"
