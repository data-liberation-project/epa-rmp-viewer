This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nQuestar\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  Questar\u00bfs Blacks Fork Gas Plant has coordinated with the Lyman Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Blacks Fork Gas Plant is located approximately 5 miles southwest of the town of Granger, Wyoming.\n\nThe plant operates a low temperature, liquid separation process for the production of `Y Grade\u00bf natural gas liquids (NGLs).  These liquids are made of propanes, butanes and heavier hydrocarbons.  Additionally, dehydrated natural gas (methane and ethane) is produced at the facility.  All of these substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  Questar has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.5 miles, for each worst case release scenario, and qualifies for Program 1 due to the plant\u00bfs distance from any public receptors.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nBlacks Fork Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five (5) years.  There have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA\u00bfs General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  \n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Blacks Fork Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of proced"

The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\nQuestar employees receive training in these procedures as necessary.\n\nEmergency Response Plan is updated as needed."
