Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices:\n\n\n\nWe at Sysco Portland, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Unforeseen, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Tualatin Valley Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services. \n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 16,313 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our ammonia refrigeration system is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process op"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nSysco Portland, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nSysco Portland, Inc. completes documented maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel complete maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Portland, Inc. to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.
