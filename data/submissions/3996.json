      "SummaryText": "The Speedway Water Works is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees and protecting the health of the surrounding community.  The Speedway Water Works is a water treatment plant located in the Town of Speedway, Indiana.  Chlorine is the only RMP regulated substance at the facility and it is used for disinfection of drinking water.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was conducted based on the recommended EPA parameters.  The worst-case scenario consisted of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine gas being released in 10 minutes.  A building enclosure was considered in the modeling which limited the release rate to 110 pounds per minute.  The worst-case scenario resulted in off-site impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a bad connection with the 1-ton cylinder.  This would result in gaseous chlorine leaking out of the 5/16-inch valve body opening.  The release rate was 10.5 pounds per minute over a 60-minute duration.  The recommended EPA atmospheric parameters were used in the modeling.  The building enclosure was considered.  The alternative release scenario resulted in off-site impacts.\n\nThe Speedway Water Works accidental release prevention program consists of all the required prevention program 3 elements.  In the past five years, the Speedway Water Works has not had an accidental chlorine release.  The facility is included under the community emergency response plan.  Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders."
