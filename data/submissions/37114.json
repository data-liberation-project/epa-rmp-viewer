Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAK Steel's Policy is to fully comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  This includes compliance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).  \n\nThe Risk Management Plan along with other safety and environmental programs already in-place enables Zanesville Works to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of hydrogen and hydrofluoric acid, including leaks, spills, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nAK Steel's emergency response program is designed to provide rapid response to suspected problems to keep hazardous materials from being released into the environment, minimize the effects of any spills and provide proper clean-up and required notifications as soon as possible following any incidents.\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nAK Steel  - Zanesville Works is a specialty steel processing facility located on Linden Avenue in Zanesville, Ohio.  The facility is subject to the requirements of Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68) of the Clean Air Act, due to on-site processes containing the regulated chemicals, hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen, above the threshold quantities specified by the rules.\n\nHydrogen is stored and used at the facility's steel finishing operations.  It is stored as a liquified gas in quantities greater than the 10,000-pound regulatory threshold.\n\nHydrofluoric acid is stored and used at the facility's steel finishing operations.  It is stored as a 70% water solution in quantities greater than the 1,000-pound regulatory threshold.  \n\nHydrofluoric acid meets the criteria for a Program 2 process as specified in the RMP rules.  Because hydrogen is regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management rules, it meets the criteria for a Program 3 process as specified in the RMP rules.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "ville Works complies with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules for hydrogen and hydrofluoric acid solution.  All elements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Program requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for both hydrogen and hydrofluoric acid at AK Steel - Zanesville Works.\n\nHydrogen\n\nThe hydrogen system meets the requirements of EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program.  The hydrogen system was designed and constructed following good engineering practices with the storage tank being designed to meet ASME standards.  The process hazard analysis was most recently revised on April 24, 2002 using the HAZOP method and all identified potential problems were addressed.  Written operating procedures for hydrogen storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with hydrogen or hydrogen containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A mechanical integrity program is in place for hydrogen equipment and operations.\n\nHydrofluoric acid\n\nThe hydrofluoric acid system meets the requirements of EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program requirements.  The hydrofluoric acid storage tanks were designed and constructed following good engineering practices.  A hazard review was conducted for hydrofluoric acid on April 24, 2002 using a hazard review checklist published in Supplemental RMP Guidance for 70% Hydrofluoric Acid Users, December 1998, developed by AlliedSignal Inc. HF Products and all identified potential problems were addressed.  Written operating procedures for hydrofluoric acid storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with hydrofluoric acid or hydrofluoric acid containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A preventive maintenance, inspection, and testing program is in place for hydrofluoric acid equipment and operations.\n\n\n4."

      "SummaryText": "Five-year Accident History\n\nHydrogen\n\nNo accidents involving hydrogen have occurred in the last five years.\n\nHydrofluoric Acid\n\nNo accidents involving hydrofluoric acid have occurred in the last five years.\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nAK Steel - Zanesville Works has trained employees for emergency response and maintains a written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with Muskingum County (Ohio) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local Fire Departments.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local fire department and outside emergency response personnel as needed.  Emergency responders including employees and off-site emergency and fire personnel have copies of the emergency response plan and are familiar with its use."
