The managerial policy for prevention of the accidental release of chlorine relies upon engineering and administrative controls, as well as implementation of, and training in, the standard operating procedures associated with safe handling, delivery and storage of chlorine.The system O&M, program administration and the emergency response policies are documented in the Facility Emergency Response Plan, the Process Safety Management Plan and our Hazard Communication and Right to Know Plan. Periodic training is provided in-house as well as by the Olean Fire Department.\n\nThe WWTF is a stationary source whose primary activity is treating mixed domestic and industrial wasteswater. Chlorine is used for disinfection of the final effluent. By administrative control, the maximum amount of chlorine stored on site is 10,000 pounds. The chlorination system operates on vacuum rather than pressure to minimize the potential for catastrophic release.Chlorination detection devices are utilized and monitoring information is incorporated into the facility's SCADA and alarm systems. Alarms are also electronically provided to the City's Civilian Dispatch network which is staffed 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The chlorination system, the detection devices and the alarm systems are routinely inspected and tested as part of the facility's maintenance management program.\n\nThe worst case scenario is one in which an entire 2000 pound cylinder releases at 200 pounds of chlorine per minute. The release is mitigated by enclosure which limits the impact distance to 0.9 miles. The most likely alternative scenario is one in which a 7/16 inch cylinder valve is broken. This creates a leak rate of 28.5 pounds per minute. Through mitigation by enclosure and with the Olean Fire Department stopping the leak within 30 minutes, impact is limited to 0.1 mile.
