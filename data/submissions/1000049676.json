Gaseous chlorine contained in one-ton chlorine containers is introduced into the water using a vacuum feed system.  All chlorine distribution lines located outside of the chlorine room are low-pressure vacuum lines. If the vacuum is broken on any of the distribution lines the chlorinators automatically shut down. The facility stores a maximum of eight (8) one (1) ton containers onsite, for a maximum combined total of 16,000 pounds of chlorine.  When Phase III construction is completed (2016) on site storage will be increased to 12 one (1) ton containers and plant capacity will be increased to 21 million gallons per day.  According to the Rule, any facility with greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine onsite is required to develop and implement a RMP.  Therefore, the Williston WTP chlorination system is a Risk Management-regulated process.\r\n\r\nChlorine containers are stored in the chlorine room, which is located in the lower level of the plant in the southeast corner.  The room is equipped with a high volume ventilation system that starts when the room light is turned on. This system is capable of exchanging one complete air volume per minute.  The Williston WTP operates the facility 24-hours per day, seven (7) days per week year round. The chlorine room and its components are visually inspected at least once per shift.  The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times.  In addition to the exhaust system, an observation window between the plant and the chlorine room allows the room to be visually checked before entering. A chlorine detector and alarm system are located outside of the room access door. \r\n\r\nChlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Its boiling point is -29.4&#61616;F.

They are built to meet Federal specifications, and are regularly inspected and pressure tested in accordance with Federal regulations.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nThe owner or operator of a stationary source is required to develop and implement a Management System to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.  This provision requires a clear delineation of the lines of authority, accountability, and responsibility for the overall Risk Management Program.  \r\n\r\nThe Williston WTP Superintendent will have overall responsibility for maintaining and implementing this procedure.  The purpose of the Management System is to ensure that all parties participating in the RMP understand their respective roles and responsibilities, and that responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Williston WTP has examined their chlorination system and the potential hazards it presents onsite and offsite.  The results of this analysis are presented in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (Section 2.0 Hazard Assessment section of the RMP), which is composed of a Worst Case and Alternate Case (most likely) Scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Analysis\r\n\r\nAlthough the USEPA acknowledges that the Worst Case Scenario is not a likely scenario, the Williston WTP has formulated a scenario to alert the public to the worst possible release.  The Worst Case Scenario for this facility involves the release of 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine (the entire contents of one (1) container) directly into the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The facility is located approximately four (4) miles southwest of the City and adjacent to U.S. Highway 85 on the north"

New employee and refresher training will be periodically provided and documented to maintain safe operating and maintenance procedures.  The Williston WTP will continue its practice of documenting all training, and will require operators to be familiar with publications such as the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual and the New York State Emergency Response Commission's Chlorine Safety Manual (For Water and Wastewater Facilities).

The vacuum is created by water passing through the ejector on the chlorinator.  When a vacuum is present and the valve is open, gaseous chlorine may be drawn from the container, through the valve, into the chlorinator, and then injected into the water.  In the absence of a vacuum on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve closes and chlorine cannot escape through the valve on the container.  In the event of equipment failure on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve is designed to immediately close due to the absence of a vacuum.\r\n\r\nBecause the regulating valve is attached directly to the chlorine container, the most likely potential route for escape of chlorine gas from the container is between the valve stem of the container and the pressure-regulating valve.  The alternate scenario modeled for this facility involves a leak from the lead gasket between the regulating valve and the chlorine container.  Each time a new container is connected to the system, a new gasket is installed.  Although the gasket is checked for leaks immediately after installation, the alternate scenario assumes a small leak is not detected the leak continues emptying the entire contents of the vessel over a period of 133 minutes (2.2 hours).  Because the vessel is inside the building with the door closed, the room acts as a passive mitigation measure and contains the release.  The radius of influence for this release is 0.2-mile, which includes some residential properties and the Missouri River.  A population of approximately 12 people reside within this radius.  In recognition of this potential release, the Williston WTP will integrate Risk Management Program training with its existing training program.  Increased employee awareness of the consequences of even a small release is expected to further reduce the likelihood"

The Williston WTP is committed to ongoing employee training to increase awareness of the potential hazards associated with the chlorination process and to further reduce the likelihood of future accidents which may result in injury and equipment or property damage.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe day-to-day result of the Rule is the mandatory implementation of a prevention program.  The intent of the prevention program is to document procedures within the facility that promote safe operation of the regulated process and reduce the potential for an uncontrolled release of the regulated substance (chlorine gas).  Components of the prevention program include the assembly of safety information, the performance of periodic hazard reviews, the establishment of safe operating and maintenance procedures, updating training policies, conducting routine compliance audits, the development of an incident investigation procedure, and the formalization of a management system. Components of the Prevention Program include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety Information\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Review\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining\r\n\u00bf\tMaintenance\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\r\n\r\n\r\nSafety information, such as Material Safety Data Sheets and equipment specifications, have been compiled and attached to the RMP for easy access by employees.

There are rural residential subdivisions north and west of the plant at a higher elevation. Across the Missouri River to the south is a wildlife management area operated by ND Game and Fish under the direction of the Army Corp of Engineers. A boat ramp is located on the south bank of the river directly across from the plant. The analysis estimated that a release of this magnitude would create a radius of influence of three (3) miles.  The radius of influence represents the distance the chlorine plume would travel from the facility, under assumed meteorological conditions, before the concentration is reduced below the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2) level, the toxic endpoint.  The USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance states the ERPG-2 concentration is that below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action. A population of approximately 400 residents resides within this radius.  The USEPA requires that the radius of influence is calculated considering a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, or 3.4 miles per hour.  Historically, average wind speed in the vicinity Williston is 10.9 miles per hour out of the southwest; thus, a release would likely disperse at a faster rate than estimated under the RMP assumed conditions.\r\n\r\nAlternate Case Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Williston WTP has also formulated an alternate, or most likely, scenario as part of its RMP.

Updates to the original plan have been submitted on-line in 1998, 2004, and 2010.  Due to a turnover in personnel in the Public Works Department and at the Williston WTP, staff has been unable to locate their in-house copy of the RMP for Chlorine.  Preparation of this document will serve as revision one (1) to the RMP for Chlorine. As part of this plan, plant staff will complete an offsite consequence analysis and develop and implement a prevention program to promote safe operation of the regulated chemicals at the site.    The facility has also updated emergency response procedures and initiated communication with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department to form a cooperative response to potential releases at the facility.  The prevention program focuses on training employees in safe operating and maintenance procedures and to recognize the potential hazards of the regulated chemical and processes.\r\n \r\nBackground\r\n\r\nThe Williston WTP is located approximately four (4) miles southwest of the City adjacent to U.S. Highway 85 on the north bank of the Missouri River. In 1959 the plant was constructed on side hill with the Burlington Northern SanteFe Railroad tracks located below the plant. Plant capacity was expanded in 1980 and 2005 the pretreatment system was updated and added ultraviolet (uv)-disinfection.  The plant is currently working on the first phase of a three phase project, with Phase I addressing filter capacity, Phase II softening and Phase III chlorine systems. The facility is owned and operated by the City of Williston, with a plant capacity of 14 million gallons of water per day.  The facility is a conventional filtration plant"

The facility is working with the Williston Municipal Fire Department and the Williams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to prepare emergency responders in the event of a major release.  The Williston WTP employees do not respond to releases other than those that can be stopped by closing a valve and will not enter the room to stop a chlorine release if the chlorine concentration is estimated to be above safe levels.  The Williston WTP relies on the Williston Municipal Fire Department and the Williams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Sheriff's Department to manage response procedures in the event of a major chlorine release at the facility.  The results of the offsite consequence analysis have been communicated to the Williston Municipal Fire Department and the Williams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which shares information with the Sheriff's Office.  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Williston WTP is confident that although the potential for a chlorine release that could affect the public or the environment is present, it is slight.  The facility has committed to comprehensive employee training and communication with offsite responders in the event of a major chlorine release.  The facility has examined the hazards associated with the regulated process, identified additional safety measures, and set a schedule for on-going implementation of those safety measures.  The Williston WTP intends to use the Risk Management Program as a means to operate more safely and efficiently and to communicate more effectively with offsite responders and the public it serves."
