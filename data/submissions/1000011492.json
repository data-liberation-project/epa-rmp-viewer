This commitment is demonstrated by our dedication of staff and resources to our accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and audits.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The utility is coordinated with Bamberg County Emergency Services, which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to repond to a release of chlroine, and is currently included in the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe Bamberg BPW Wastewater Treatment Plant is permitted for 1 million gallons per day of sanitary and industrial waste, mostly from the City of Bamberg.  The plant is an aerated lagoon system with more than 225 acres of sprayfields for land application of the treated wastewater.  The effluent must meet fecal coliform permit limits of 200 mg/L geometric mean monthly average and 400 mg/L maximum prior to land application, which is achieved with chlorine disinfection.\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at the plant is 8,000 pounds (lbs) or four one-ton containers.  The 2,000-lb container is the largest chlorine storage vessel on-site and all of the containers are located in a shelter with three walls, providing releases direct contact with outside air.  Although the inventory of chlorine on-site has increased, the vacuum feed system and larger containers are safer due to automatic shutoff during loss of vacuum, less handling, deliveries, etc.\n\nThe Bamberg BPW Wastewater Treatment Plant does not have reportable accidental releases in the previous five-year period.\n\nThe chlorination system must meet Program 3 prevention program requirements, as the covered process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under the Sout"

      "SummaryText": "h Carolina OSHA program.  The elements in the program include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, maintenance, audits, incident investigations, management of change, pre-startup reviews, contractors, employee participation, and hot work permits.  Addressing the requirements of each element provides the foundation of the Bamberg BPW Wastewater Treatment PlantA?s accidental release prevention program.  The program is integrated into the operation of the chlorination system by senior management and operations staff.\n\nThe Bamberg BPW Wastewater Treatment Plant has an emergency response program in place to enable Bamberg BPW to effectively respond to a chlorine release, minimize injuries, lessen the impact to the surrounding community, and provide guidance to emergency response personnel.  The operating staff is trained to respond to minor chlorine releases and to follow established procedures on seeking outside assistance as needed, providing public notifications, etc.  The Bamberg BPW has in place mutual aid agreements with neighboring utilities and is coordinated with local emergency responders (e.g., local emergency planning committee, fire department, etc.).\n\nAt present, no changes to chlorination system to improve safety are anticipated.  However, after installation and startup of the chlorination system, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, etc. will be revised as needed, as we are committed to the full implementation of our risk management program."
