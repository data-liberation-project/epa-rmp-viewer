      "SummaryText": "The Water Treatment Facility consists of approximately 19 acres of land containing various tanks, equipment, and buildings used in the pumping from raw potable water from four on-site wells , storing this water to be used as needed, disenfecting the water by the injection of Chlorine gas, and pumping this water, under pressure, throughout the service area via the distribution system.\n\nChlorine is used in the disenfection of the potable water leaving the plant and is stored in one ton cylinders in the Chlorine Storage building, located  to the Northeast of the office building.  Quantities stored at the plant site vary from less than 2000 to a maximum of 8000 pounds depending on usage and time since last restocking took place.\n\nOur risk management plan states the rules and procedures to be followed for the safe handling, usage, and storage of chlorine.\n\nThe only releases in the last five years have been minor leaks occurring during the connecting of cylinders to the distribution system.  These small leaks have caused no major problems and have been corrected by the plant employees without any injury or damage.  An alarm system is in place and will sound an alarm in event of even a minor leak.\n\nIn case of a major leak, the Police/Fire Department is to be notified, along with the Chief Opeator or Superintendent.  The Fire Department will report to the scene and take immediate control of the situation  until the problem has been corrected and the plant returned to normal operations.\n\nThis plan is available at all times to the plant staff."
