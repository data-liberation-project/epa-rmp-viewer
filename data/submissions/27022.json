      "SummaryText": "I. General Description\n\nDixie Chemical's manufacturing plant is situated on 45 acres in the Bayport Industrial Park, 25 miles Southeast of Houston.   As a leading manufacturer of performance chemicals, Dixie's products find a variety of end uses.  These include:\n   Resins\n   Coatins and Printing Inks\n   Paper Sizing Chemicals\n   Sovents\n   Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics\n   Surfactants\n   Lube Additives\n   Textiles and dyes\n   Agricultural Chemicals\n\nContract chemical processing is also a vital part of Dixie Chemical's operation.  Dixie Chemical performs sophisticated custom processing under contracts with other chemical manufacturing companies.\n\nDixie Chemical produces most of these products via multi-step synthesis operations.  These batch operations include any of the following unit operations:\n  Centrifugation\n  Crystallization\n  Drying\n  Extraction\n  Mixing\n  Solvent Exchange\n  Synthesis Reactions\n\nDixie utilizes the following toxic materials in sufficient quantities to be included under the USEPA RMP regulations: Acrylonitrile, Epichlorohydrin, and Propyleneimine.  Similarly Dixie uses the following flammable materials in sufficient quantities to also be included under the RMP program: 1,3-Butadiene, and Isoprene.  Of the above chemicals only Proplyeneimine is manufactured at Dixie's Bayport facility.  It is sold seperately and is also used as a raw material for the subsequent synthesis of another product.  The remainder of the above regulated chemicals serve as raw materials.\n\nDixie is committed to providing a safe workplace, a clean environment, and continued quality improvements.  All plant operating personnel are required to have classroom instruction as well as equipment specific training prior to being able to independently work in any of the manufacturing areas.  A complete hazard review and operating manual, meeting Process Safety Management regulations, are in place before starting to make any of our products.  A team consisting of production, engineering,"

Risk Involement\n\nBecause of the nature of Epichlorohydrin, 1,3-Butadiene, and Isoprene they are stored in their own dedicated storage tank.  Each of these tanks are located wihtin a spill containment area sufficient to contain the volume of the largest tank within the respective area along with a six inch rainfall.  Since Dixie only uses a small volume of Acrylonitrile it is consumed on a campaign basis directly out of a tank trailer.  The trailer is spotted in a spill containment area sufficient to contain the volume of the entire trailer.  This insures that spills will not leave Dixie's plant site.  Because Dixie's manufacturing efforts are scheduled in campaigns, and not continuously, the inventories of the above hazardous chemicals are kept at a minimum (zero for Acrylonitrile) between campaigns thus reducing the risk associated with these aforementioned chemicals most of the year.  Propyleneimine is packaged into cylinders batchwise as it is manufactured.\n\nIII. Worst Case Scenarios\n\nThe Consequences of a spill or total release of any of the three following chemicals were assessed:  Acrylonitrile, Epichlorohydrin, and Propyleneimine.  In each case the entire contents of the respective storage tank was empied into its respective containment area.  Under the USEPA's very conservative Off Site Consequences Analysis, the area of influence, where the concentration of fumes from such a spill could be hazardous to a person's health, was determined.  Since dixie's Bayport facility is located in an industraikl park, the distance from Dixie plant to the nearest residential neighbor is over a mile.  The calculated areas of influence for each of the worst case scenarios from the three above chemicals did not reach out to any residential neighborhoods.  Similarly, the effects of a worst case release of either of Dixie's two flammable materials followed by a fire would not reach any of these"

Alternative Scenarios\n\nThe consequence of a spill or release of any of the three following toxic chemicals, denoted as Alternative scenarios, based on historical performance were made to more appropriately assess the risk to the community: Acrylontrile, Epichlorohydrin, and Propyleneimine.  In each of the three cases small amounts were assumed either as overflowing from a storage container or leaking from a punctured container.  Passive measures such as dikes were assumed.  In addition, the efforts of personnel were assumed which would minimize the amount spilled or released.  Again the area of influence from these three cases did not reach any of the residential neighborhoods and in fact seldom got beyond the property line of Dixie.  Similarly, the effects of an Alternative Scenario associated with our flammable materials did not reach any of our residential neighborhoods.\n\nV. OSHA PSM Measures at Dixie\n\nOSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been in place at Dixie's Bayport plant for over nine years.  This program which has as its central goal the protection of Dixie's personnel within our plant site has resulted in a safety program which also extends out beyond our plant site to help protect our adjacent industrial and residential neighbors.  This PSM program involves formal reviews of potential process hazards to identify and prevent process accidents prior to and during operations.  In dixie's PSM program regular equipment inspections are performed.  A Management of Change (MOC) program prevents unauthorized equipment or process changes of any PSM and/or RMP regulated operation.  Prompt and detailed investigations of every safety incident are carried out in order to insure that other incidents do not happen.  Audits are performed to ensure that the proper manufacturing and safety procedures are followed.  The following changes have taken place under PSM program which have reduced incidences at Dixie.

Water spray systems for cooling tanks are present in RMP flammable material storage.\n\nVI. Accident History\n\nNo accidental spills or releases of RMP chemicals occured at Dixie chemical which either harmed any employee or the environment during the last five years.\n\nVII. Emergency Response Program\n\nDixie chemical has a fully trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) at the Bayport facility.  This team is made up of volunteers from operations.  Several members of the ERT are on each of the four rotating shifts such that immediate help can occur whenever an accident, spill, or other emergency happens. All ERT personnel receive training as specified by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.156, and the National Fire Protection Association standards.  Annual refresher training is conducted for all team personnel.  Drills are conducted at least annually to certify the current  level of readiness of all ERT personnel.  Drills are evaluated to verify proficiency and to identify areas of needed improvement.\n\nA plant alarm system serves to alert all plant personnel to any emergencies.  A Community Awareness/Emergency Response (CAER) phone line permits citizens to be informed of drills, emergencies, and other areas of interest.  The plant radio network is also used to coordinate the actions during any ERT event.\n\nDixie Chemical is a member of the Channel Industry Mutual Aid organization (CIMA) which provides mutual emergency response from over 50 companies in the event aid is needed.  Dixie's ERT particapates in area emergency drills with CIMA and the local LEPC.\n\nVIII  Possible Changes to Reduce Risk\n\nDixie's product mix changes frequently due to the nature of the speciality chemical business.  These changes provide opportunities for risk reduction.  Equipment must be modified to produce a new product.  We use these changes as a chance to upgrade the equipment by adding additi"
