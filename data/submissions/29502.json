      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt the Nu-Foam Products, Inc. (Nu-Foam) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautions have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees at the Nu-Foam Chattanooga plant, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and in up to seven standby railcars) at our plant is about 750,000 l"

      "SummaryText": "b.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA\u00bfs risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPA\u00bfs threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\nWe performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs can help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which an accidental release might affect the public (the endpoint distance).  The following could occur at the endpoint distance: Most people at the endpoint distance of a toxic substance release like TDI would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\n\t[Note: The following sections entitled Worst-case release scenario and Alternative release scenario are similar to those contained in EPA and industry guidance documents for risk management plans (RMPlans).  The EPA recently decided not to include on the Internet the OCA data submitted in sections 2 \u00bf 5 of the RMPlan.  In January 1999, the EPA also revised its guidance on the scenario sections of the Executive Summary to delete an earlier"

The current guidance remains to describe each of the plant\u00bfs scenarios but it has been revised for the plant to indicate whether the release has offsite impact.  The following scenario sections conform to this latest EPA guidance.]\n\nWorst-case release scenario.  Catastrophic failure of a TDI railcar, having a capacity of 200,000 lb of TDI, would be a worst-case release for a toxic substance because a TDI railcar is the largest outdoor TDI container at the plant.  The TDI vendors limit the quantity of TDI loaded into a railcar to a maximum of 190,000 lb to allow space for thermal expansion during possible heating of the TDI.  During hot weather, the TDI temperature could reach the maximum ambient temperature of 97  \u00b0F.  We assumed the release would occur at 100 \u00b0F to be conservative and allow for a margin of error in release modeling.  We also assumed that the entire contents of the railcar would be released as a liquid, form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately ,000 ft2 with a depth of about 0.4 inches (1 cm), and evaporate to form a toxic cloud that would disperse downwind.  Given the presence of nearby buildings and trees surrounding the TDI railcar, the terrain was considered more urban than rural.  Refined dispersion modeling predicts that the distance from the railcar to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 1.0 ppm (0.007 mg/L) extends beyond the plant\u00bfs property boundary and touches portions of three adjacent properties.\n\nAlternate release scenario.  Rupture of the transfer line from the railcar to the TDI storage tank would release TDI to the ground at a calculated rate of 5,800 lb/min.  We assumed that the TDI temperature in the railcar is typically 85 \u00b0F and that the railcar is pressurized with air at 30 psig to facilitate unloading.  We also assumed that the release would continue for the 20 minutes expected for an employee to be able to stop the release by closing the railca"
