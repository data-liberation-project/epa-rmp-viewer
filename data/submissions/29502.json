      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt the Nu-Foam Products, Inc. (Nu-Foam) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautions have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees at the Nu-Foam Chattanooga plant, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and in up to seven standby railcars) at our plant is about 750,000 l"

      "SummaryText": "b.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA?s risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPA?s threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\nWe performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs can help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which an accidental release might affect the public (the endpoint distance).  The following could occur at the endpoint distance: Most people at the endpoint distance of a toxic substance release like TDI would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\n    [Note: The following sections entitled \"Worst-case release scenario\" and \"Alternative release scenario\" are similar to those contained in EPA and industry guidance documents for risk management plans (RMPlans).  The EPA recently decided not to include on the Internet the OCA data submitted in sections 2 ? 5 of the RMPlan.  In January 1999, the EPA also revised its guidance on the scenario sections of the Executive Summary to delete an earlier"

The current guidance remains to describe each of the plant?s scenarios but it has been revised for the plant to indicate whether the release has offsite impact.  The following scenario sections conform to this latest EPA guidance.]\n\nWorst-case release scenario.  Catastrophic failure of a TDI railcar, having a capacity of 200,000 lb of TDI, would be a worst-case release for a toxic substance because a TDI railcar is the largest outdoor TDI container at the plant.  The TDI vendors limit the quantity of TDI loaded into a railcar to a maximum of 190,000 lb to allow space for thermal expansion during possible heating of the TDI.  During hot weather, the TDI temperature could reach the maximum ambient temperature of 97  ?F.  We assumed the release would occur at 100 ?F to be conservative and allow for a margin of error in release modeling.  We also assumed that the entire contents of the railcar would be released as a liquid, form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately ,000 ft2 with a depth of about 0.4 inches (1 cm), and evaporate to form a toxic cloud that would disperse downwind.  Given the presence of nearby buildings and trees surrounding the TDI railcar, the terrain was considered more urban than rural.  Refined dispersion modeling predicts that the distance from the railcar to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 1.0 ppm (0.007 mg/L) extends beyond the plant?s property boundary and touches portions of three adjacent properties.\n\nAlternate release scenario.  Rupture of the transfer line from the railcar to the TDI storage tank would release TDI to the ground at a calculated rate of 5,800 lb/min.  We assumed that the TDI temperature in the railcar is typically 85 ?F and that the railcar is pressurized with air at 30 psig to facilitate unloading.  We also assumed that the release would continue for the 20 minutes expected for an employee to be able to stop the release by closing the railca"

Prompt response to such a release is possible because written operating procedures require a trained operator, with appropriate personal protective equipment nearby, to continuously monitor TDI railcar unloading.  The resulting pool of TDI on the ground would spread to cover an area of approximately 32,800 ft2 with a depth of 0.4 inches and evaporate to form a toxic cloud that would disperse downwind.  Refined dispersion modeling predicts that the distance from the pool to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 1.0 ppm would not impact any different off-site receptors than the worst-case scenario and would impact one offsite receptor instead of three.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA?s Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst-case release scenario for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is exempt from OSHA?s process safety management standard, and (3) our polyurethane foam process has not been targeted by the EPA for Level 3 coverage.  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n? Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes, and equipment\n \n? Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedures\n \n? Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances\n \n? Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs\n \n?

The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and management system failures.\n \n In addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain or control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.

We have had one small release of TDI over the past 5 years.  That release was less than 100 lb of TDI and was quickly neutralized and remediated.

Our procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.
