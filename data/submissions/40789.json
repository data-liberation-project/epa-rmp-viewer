This hazard assessment also includes maps that delineate the off-site consequence (OCA) analysis.  The OCA analysis has not been included in this executive summary in accordance with EPA restrictions.\n\nThis OCA information has been provided to the general public (e.g. Local/State Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the local fire department/HAZMAT response team) through correspondence dated August 9, 2000 and a public meeting held on September 5, 2000.

A number of PHA items have been completed since December 2000.  These are designated as ?Action Complete? or ?AC?. Several other items will be addressed in accordance with recommended time frames.\n\n6.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS \n\nStandard Operating procedures either existed or were developed for the facility.  These include programs such as lockout/tagout, confined space, hot work permit, propane procedures, etc.  A number of these programs have standard operating procedures and checklist that are requisite for documenting regulatory compliance, particularly for the regulated propane process.  The instructions for completion of the forms are included in the RMP document.  UST completes these (or equivalent) forms and maintains documentation in the facility files.  \n\nTighe & Bond personnel visited the facility on June 18, 2000 to investigate and document standard operating procedures for the hardening furnaces.  Operators at the facility reviewed and commented on draft procedures developed by Tighe & Bond.

This procedure is implemented by using the Management of Change forms (MOC) found in Section 9.5 of the RMP.  \n\nThese forms provide a system that evaluates potential changes to the system and potential effects on the process safety operation.  The forms must be completed any time there is a change to the process that could affect the overall safety of the chemical system.  All RMPC designees are familiar with this process.\n\nSince December 2000, there have been minor changes to the system to include the addition of one generator identical to the two existing generators.  The plan has been updated accordingly. Operating procedures for the new generator are identical to procedures for the existing generators.\n\n10.0    PRE-START SAFETY REVIEW \n\nThe facility performs a pre-startup safety review for new or modified facilities as necessary.  The checklist found in Section 5 (PHA) of the RMP provides the necessary information to review and evaluate potential modifications to the existing process.  This process is started as soon as possible in the conceptual design of the project.\n\nIf there are any renovations or facility changes that would impact the process systems, it is required that the forms found in Section 10.4 (Action Item Documentation) of the RMP be completed and that any action items be incorporated into the project.  Appropriate changes may also be necessary in standard operating procedures (e.g. lockout/tagout, emergency plan, operating procedures, etc.).  These can be made through Section 9 (Management of Change Procedure) of the RMP.\n\nSince December 2000, there have been no significant changes that would require Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews.\n\n11.0    COMPLIANCE AUDITS \n\nComprehensive compliance audits must be performed at least every three years, while some specific p"

We recommend that all accidents be investigated.  The standard investigation system for evaluating these types of accidents is included in Section 12.4 of the RMP.  This includes an investigation form that must be completed at the time of the accident.\n\nUpon completion of this activity, a group of individuals should investigate and determine why the accident took place.  Recommendations for corrective actions should be provided, implemented, and documented.  This should minimize the potential for reoccurrence of future similar accidents.\n\nSince December 2000, there have been no reportable incidents at the facility relative to the propane system.
