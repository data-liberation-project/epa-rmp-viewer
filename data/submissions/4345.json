To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods SEDALIA, MO., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods (insert facility location), has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     Poultry slaughter plant & further processing. \n \n    Regulated substances: Ammonia \n \n    Amount of regulated substance:319,961LBS.\n  \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing 36,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of 36,000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 3.37 MILES before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative release scenario iii. - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before n"
