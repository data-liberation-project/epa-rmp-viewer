The Emergency Response Plan \n(Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was\ndesigned to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe emergency response procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and \nMitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation.  \nThis manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe AmeriCold Logistics Plant #80570 facility is located at 660 Fifth Street in Turlock, California.  The facility is \nsituated at the intersection of Firth Street and F Street, approximately one half-mile south of West Main Street.  The\nimmediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with residential areas primarily to the north and west.\n\nThe facility chills and stores a variety of food products such as fruit, fish, and poultry.  The facility operates the ammonia\nrefrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for storing these food products.  The facility was originally \nbuilt in 1953 Between 1956 and 1989 several additional cold storage rooms and an Instant Quick Freeze were added to \nincrease freezing and storage capacity.  The facility currently covers approximately 6.3 acres.\n\nAmmonia in this facility exceeds the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted\n  on the engine room roof, the diffuser is located outside the engine room, and all of the evaporators are loca"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n     STEPS\n\nThe facility operates In accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines\nand standards including the following:\n\n? IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Maidng Ammonia Refrigeration \n       Tie-ins\" \n? IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \n? IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nIn addition, the AmeriCold Logistics Plant #80570 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for\ncompliance with the Cal-OSHA regulation.\n\nE. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP reportable releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years. \n\nF. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility.\n\n1.      In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will Immediately go to the nearest public address system and announce: \"ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - THERE IS AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION)\". A supervisor in the area will determine whether or not the building must be evacuated.\n\n2. If the building is to be evacuated, the Supervisor will announce over the public address system:\n\"ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - EVACUATE THE BUILDING.  WE HAVE AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION).  WALK ! DO NOT RUN!\"\n\n3.      Upon notification to evacuate the building, the management person closest to the alarm system will begin sounding the evacuation alarm (three short blasts on a portable alarm).  This alarm should be sounded for at least one minute or until it is evident all personnel are aware of the evacuation.\n\n4.      The Su"

Employees will begin exiting  the building as per the published evacuation plan, and report to the proper area outside the building for a head count.\n\n6.       All Shift Supervisors will report to their assigned areas and perform a head count.\n\n7.       After a complete head count, each Supervisor will report the results of the head count to the person in charge of the plant. The person in charge of the plant will give the approximate working area for any persons not accounted for to the Fire Chief.\n\n8. When the alarm is over, the Fire Department will determine the extent of the damage, the clean-up                  \n          procedure and whether or not the shift can be continued.\n\n9. Notify the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources, Hazardous Materials Division. The following information should be relayed                     \n      to the County.\n\n? Address of the plant.\n? Callers name and name of the company.\n? Name of the hazardous material released.\n? Time of the release.\n? Quantity of hazardous chemical released\n\n 10.    If more than 100 pounds of ammonia is released, the National Response Center should be notified at (800) 424-8802.\n\n   11.    Within 48 hours, a complete investigation must be performed and all regulations and requirement of Process   \n       Safety Management must be met.\n\n 12.    Within 30 days of the release, the Emergency Release Follow-up Notice Reporting Form must be completed and sent to the Chemical Emergency Planning and Response Center (CEPRC) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Sacramento.\n\n G.
