The owners, management and employees of Tripoli Fertilizer Company are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonie.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility s storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in two storage tanks (12,000 gallons, 11,740 gallons).\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.   A.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a peiod of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 100,895 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm is 2.1 miles.  B.  The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential accident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provision of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U>S> Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrou"

The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is reference in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n5.  Five Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n6.  Emergency Response Program.  The facility has:  A.  A written plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;  B.  provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Titlte III (EPCRA);  C.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
