              "Description": "The Titanium Production Facility has four process units  that contain titanium tetrachloride.  All of the process units use the same prevention program.  The prevention program elements that are applied uniformly for all process units are as follows:\n\nManagement of Change;  Training Program;  Compliance Audits;  Incident Investigation; Employee Participation; Safe Work Practices, including Hot Work Permit; Contractor Safety Procedures, including Contractor evaluations.\n\nThe process units work in series to produce, refine, store, and use titanium tetrachloride for the production of titanium metal.   Each unit uses different equipment to achieve this goal.  Because of these differences, the application of the remaining prevention program elements is unique to each unit. However, the management of these prevention programs is common for each of the units. These differences are described below:\n\na) Process Safety Information:  the type of Process Safety Information required for each of the units is the same, but the actual information kept, such as MSDS sheets or Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams is unique to the chemicals and equipment in the unit.  The PSI is revised as changes are made; however a scheduled review of all process safety information for all units is done to ensure accuracy, completeness, and uniformity.\n\nb) Process Hazard Analysis:  the PHA for each unit occurs separately.  The method chosen for the PHA depends on the complexity of the unit; the process units use the HAZOP method, which applies to all of the covered process units.  The following is a list of the covered units and the dates of the last PHA.\n\nChlorination Unit: May, 1997\nTiCl4 Storage Unit: June, 1997\nTiCl4 Purification Unit: May, 1998\nVDP Unit: September, 1998\n\nThe expected, or actual, date of completion for recommendations made during a PHA study is 2 years from the completion of the study.\n\nc)  Operating Procedures:  the format and management for operating procedures is the same throughout the facility.  Each unit has its own set of operating procedures, which are used and reviewed in the day to day operations.\n\nd)  Maintenance Procedures:  the maintenance procedures,and the type and  frequency of inspection and testing are dependent on the type of equipment in each unit.  Maintenance, including inspection and testing, is performed daily. Each area maintains an inspection list  to address all equipment.",
