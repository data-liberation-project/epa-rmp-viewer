      "SummaryText": "The Great Bend Coop Executive Summary-Boyd Branch-Prepared by: Dennis D. Neeland\n1.Facility Policy\nThe Management and Employees are committed to the prevention of any type of accidental release of NH3 or any other chemical that is stored at this facility. The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \"AG-21\" member, one of only three in the State of Kansas. AG-21 is a program that is Enviromental Driven. The Coop goes above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customers, employees, and the enviroment.\n2.Facility Information\nThe NH3 plant is located in Boyd Kansas, which is located four miles west of Hoisington Kansas. The town of Boyd has been unpopulated for a number of years. Only one house remains directly north of the facility. The Facility has two tanks of 30,000 and 11,000 gallons each. This facility, once or twice per year,for 24 to 48 hours. Anhydrous Ammonia is used in a process (t-reactor) of blending to make 10-34-0 started grade liquid fertilizer.\n3.The Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenario\nWorst case scenario would release 191,601 in a ten minute period, or 19,200 pounds per minute, with a five mile endpoint. The alternate release involves over filling of a nurse trailer and this would only travel 0.10 to end point. The alternate release that are expressed are estimates.\n4.Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Coop reconizes all safety procedures required by State and Federal Regulations. The Coop also complies with recommendations from Farmland's AG-21 policies and general industry standards. The most common accidental release would be from over filling nurse trailers. An example would be if a trailer would be filled from 85-90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape. The Great Bend Coop's policy is not to fill trailers over 86%.\n5.Five Year Accidient History\nThe Coop has not had a major accidental release within the past five years.\n6.Emerge"

The Committee tours a Branch or Department once per month. All areas are toured at least once in a twelve month period, sometimes twice. Safety is an on going program, changes are made on a as needed basis as new regulations or concerns arise."
