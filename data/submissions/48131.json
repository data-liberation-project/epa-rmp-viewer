      "SummaryText": "II. General Information and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCVC Specialty Chemicals, Inc. (CVC) purchased the Maple Shade, New Jersey facility from Akzo-Nobel Chemicals, Inc. in June 1995.  Full occupancy of the site took place in November 1995 after completion of construction activities to upgrade and convert the site for research and development and small scale manufacturing of specialty epoxy monomers and resins based on epichlorohydrin chemistry.\n\nThe Maple Shade, New Jersey site is the Corporate Headquarters for CVC and serves as the principle site for scale-up, semi-works and small scale manufacturing of epoxy resins and monomers.  CVC handles only one of the listed EPA RMP or NJDEP TCPA listed chemicals above threshold quantities - epichlorohydrin.  Epichlorohydrin is the basic building blocks chemical used in epoxy manufacturing and provides the basis for the site risks management and accident prevention plans.\n\nEpichlorohydrin is handled on site in bulk in quantities that do not exceed 308,700 lb.  Storage facilities include one 15,000-gallon aboveground storage tank for fresh epichlorohydrin storage and one 6,000-gallon storage tank for recycle epichlorohydrin storage.  Process equipment includes four reactors that are 1,200-gallons, 2,000-gallons and two 4,100 gallon reactors in capacity.\n\nThe epoxy resins and monomers (modifiers) produced by CVC are used primarily in the specialty coatings industry.  Applications include civil engineering coatings such as floor coatings, tank and secondary containment linings, and structural steel primers.  Other common uses include adhesives, and specialty automotive and aviation coatings and composites.\n\nIII. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Maple Shade facility is designed and operated to minimize the potential for on-site or off-site safety and environmental impact to employees and the surrounding community.  In 1995, the facility was upgraded with the help of a major engineering/const"

Since the June start-up in 1996, the company has not had an accidental release involving the hazardous chemical.  There have been no incidents to date of an on-site or off-site injury or illness due to epichlorohydrin handling or exposure.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention is managed by CVC using methodology encouraged by OSHA PSM and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophic Prevention Act (TCPA).  The CVC Maple Shade Facility is operated as an RMP Program 3 facility.  Engineering and operational protocols include:\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process, equipment and chemical safety reviews were conducted prior to start-up and as an on-going policy for refresher training and any process changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - Hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) are used for all facility hazard analysis.  Action plans are documented and implemented for all risk reduction items.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOP's are documented and updated on a continuous basis and include start up, shut down and normal operating procedures for manufacturing epoxy resins.\n\nTraining - A training schedule for all operating personnel is planned, executed and documented on an annual basis.  Training includes required regulatory training for hazard communications, hazardous waste, emergency response and process training.  Refresher training is conducted as required.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Preventive maintenance (PM) procedures are in place to assure continuing safe operation of process equipment.  A work order and PM system is utilized to monitor equipment integrity and reliability.  A computer maintenance management system (CMMS) was implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation - CVC actively utilize"

Contractor safety procedures and orientation requirements are enforced for all contact project work.\n\nManagement of Change and Pre-Start-up Review - CVC has in place a Process Change Authorization (PCA) procedure that requires a full safety, environmental and operating review and approval prior to implementation of any material or procedural process change.  Pre-Start-Up safety reviews are conducted prior to any new process start-up.\n\nEmergency Response - CVC has a full Emergency Response (ER) and Discharge Prevention, Containment and Countermeasure (DPCC) Plan in place.  ER and DPCC manuals were first established in 1997. In 2003 Emergency drill exercises with the Township's Fire Company and LEPC officials, NJDEP and county residents were conducted.  Internal Company emergency response and evacuation exercises are on-going and documented as part of the safety program.\n\nCompliance Audit - Annual internal compliance audits for EPA RMP and NJDEP developed and implemented and have been improved upon.  Site performance will be measured against required RMP elements and a report with remedial actions issued on an annual basis.\n\nIV. Planned Safety Improvements\n\nCVC, as a new operating company, plans to continuously enhance existing procedures and solidify the company philosophy and prevention program elements required by EPA, RMP and NJDEP TCPA.  \n                                                                                                                                                                 Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) - A second, more comprehensive HAZOP of the epoxy manufacturing unit was completed in July, 2002.
