The facility's overall approach to chemical safety begins with an understanding of isopentane's hazards and requirements for safe use as a part of the existing Hazard Communication program.  The facility has conducted a Process Hazard Analysis to evaluate and assure a safe process design and a Process Safety Management program has been develop to assure safe operation.  The isopentane handling systems are designed with controls to prevent and minimize accidental release.  Written procedures for unloading shipments of isopentane, require supervision by specially trained employees.  This allows us to immediately detect equipment failures and prevent dangerous release situations.  Alarms, excess flow devices and automatic shutdown systems connected to isopentane detectors are part of our spill prevention program.  The emergency response program is a combination of responses by trained employees for incipient fires and minor releases to evacuation and response by the local emergency agencies.  Material and equipment is kept on site, to respond to, and contain accidental spills or releases. There is a strict no smoking, no flames/sparks policy in effect in all areas where isopentane is present. These areas are clearly marked with no smoking signs.\n\nFacility Description and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThis facility uses isopentane, CAS number 78-78-4, as the blowing agent to manufacture polystyrene foam sheet.  The foam sheet is then separately processed into various end products such as food containers by thermoforming.  The isopentane is received in 8,500-gallon tank trucks and stored in an 18,000 gallon above ground storage tank.  The isopentane is pumped through two pumping st"

The maximum amount of isopentane stored on site will be 93,000 pounds.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation to prevent or minimize the consequences of releases of flammable or explosive isopentane.  A Process Hazards Analysis was conducted to help assure that process hazards were identified, evaluated and controlled to the greatest extent possible.  Process hazards were engineered out of the system's design whenever possible.  The facility has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely operating the regulated process. There are detailed written procedures for unloading isopentane and for the safe handling of isopentane that will limit or prevent spills. The written procedures are an integral part of operator training program. All company employees are trained regarding the chemical and physical attributes of isopentane.  The training starts with the Hazard Communication training on the first day of employment and continues to be reinforced with on the job training.  Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment and piping, control over entrance into the facility and a hot work permit program for employees and contractor employees.  Smoking or open flames are strictly forbidden in areas where isopentane or other flammable materials are likely to be present. All visitors and contractors are advised of the hazardous nature of isopentane if they are visiting an area where it is likely to be present.  Signs are used to reinforce the no smoking, no flames warnings for critical areas.  The site has lower explosive limit (LEL) detector meters "

The process also utilizes automatic valve closure, flow diversion and pump shutdown to minimize and contain any releases.   \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe facility has not experienced a reportable accident in the past five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has established and implemented an emergency planning and response program.  Management is responsible for training all plant personnel in evacuation and emergency response procedures.  If an emergency arises, management will direct employees concerning how to respond or evacuate and decide when outside help is required.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for handling small releases and for responding to incipient fires. The local fire department has been made aware of the hazards at this facility and has visited the site to review emergency response needs. The emergency response program is reviewed and updated as needed.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility reviews the emergency plan annually and updates the plan, as needed, anytime hazards change.  All new employees are trained regarding the emergency plan and all employees are notified when hazards in their work area change.  The operating procedures will be reviewed annually to assure they are current and accurate.  Affected employees will be trained based on the current operating procedures.  The facility will continue to aggressively maintain their emergency preparedness and general safety program.\n"
