To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods TEMPERANCEVILLE, VA., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods TEMPERANCEVILLE, VA., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     Poultry slaughter plant & fresh processing\n     Regulated substances: Ammonia \n     Amount of regulated substance:  72,500lbs.\n  \n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n\tTyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators. \n \n4.  Five-year accident history.\nOn June 30th, 2005, at approximately 12:30 a.m. during routine cleanup of the MSC operation, a product-containing 3 inch stainless pipe was dropped, striking a \u00bc\u00bf oil drain valve on the Votator.  This resulted in the valve nipple weld breaking creating a 1/8\u00bf opening from which anhydrous ammonia vapor escaped.  The four team members"

The senior management official on site notified our refrigeration department and instructed security to call 911.  Trained refrigeration team members donned full face respirators and entered the MSC area to identify the source of the leak.  It was determined to be a Votator oil drain and the refrigeration team member then went to the roof area to close the valve.  When outside agencies arrived, the leak had been isolated and further action was unnecessary.  The four team members from the leak area were transported to the local hospital for observation as a precautionary measure and released.  A refrigeration contractor was called to affect repairs to the Votator.  It should be noted that neither of the refrigeration personnel that responded to the leak required medical treatment.\n \n5.   The emergency response program.\t\nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n\nAll Hazmat courses at Tyson Foods, Inc., are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) (7) and (8).  \nAll TEMPERANCEVILLE, VA.
