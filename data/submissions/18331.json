Our facility policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of Ag Partners,LLC   Hartley are   \ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\nIf an accidental release should occur, our facility is prepared to work with the local\nfire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the \nimpact of the release to people and the environment.\n2. Facility information\n    The primary activity of our facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for\nsale to farmers.\n    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application\nas a crop production nutrient.\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 80,650 pounds in our 18,000 gal.  \nstorage tank.\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of \nof our storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity\n    released would be pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 87%\n    capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to toxic endpoint is 4.2 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential  incident\n    is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to toxic endpoint is 0.3 mile.\n4. Accidental release prevention program.\n    Our facility has implemented the provisions of  \" Safety requirements for the \n    Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia ,K61.1\" published by the American\n    National Standard Institute (ANSI) and the Standards of the Occupational  Safety\n    and Health  Administration  (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 \" Storage and Handling\n    of  Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n5. The five year accident history.\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five\n    years  that: have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property\n    or environmental  damage.\n6.
