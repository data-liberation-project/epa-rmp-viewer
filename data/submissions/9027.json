      "SummaryText": "SAFETY POLICY STATEMENT\nIt is the policy of Davis Gas Processing that accident prevention shall be considered of primary importance in all phases of operation and administration. It is the intention of Davis Gas Processing management to provide safe and healthy working conditions and to establish and insist upon safe practices at all times by all employees. The prevention of accidents is an objective affecting all levels of our company and its operations. It is, therefore, a basic requirement that each supervisor make the safety of all employees an integral part of his or her regular management function. It is equally the duty of each employee to accept and follow established safety regulations and procedures. Every effort will be made to provide adequate training to employees. Employees are expected to assist management in accident prevention activities. Unsafe conditions must be reported immediately. Safety is everyone\u0012s business.\n\nSITE DESCRIPTION\nThe Big Lake DGP Plant is located 6miles east of Big Lake, Tx. On Hwy. 67.\nThere is a Liquid Petroleum Gas Product Storage Tank and a Propane storage tank for refrigeration, which both tanks add up to about 190 barrels of product. Both tanks are painted, welded steel, above ground, horizontal pressure vessel. The  tanks operates up to 200 psig and is protected by a pressure relief valve. Liquid flow into these tanks is determined by the process operations. Liquid flow out of these tanks goes to tank truck loading and is manually controlled. Operating personnel on a daily basis visually inspect these tanks.  If a spill occurred at these tanks, the contents are so volatile that they would evaporate before penetrating the ground to any significant degree. The ground would freeze and contain the propane as it evaporated.\nThere is also two Natural Gas Liquid Storage Tanks, which add up to 1,050 barrels of product, both are painted, welded steel, above ground, vertical vessels. The tanks are protected by a pressure relief val"
