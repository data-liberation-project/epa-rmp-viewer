              "Description": "The process consists of a 450 ton/day potable ice manufacturing system and asscoiated equipment for production and storage of ice.  An ammonia absorption recovery system(AAR) is used to cool the liquid overfeed systems for the ice-makers and freezer coils for facility cooling.  Installed mechanical compressors can be used in conjunction with the AAR to supply refrigeration needs.\n\nThe interface between the liquid overfeed systems and the AAR consists of two shell and tube heat exchangers.  Process equipment utilizes PLC based controls, as well as, hard-wired interlocks to provide safety shutdowns (ie. high/low pressure, temp., levels, flows, etc).  Audible and visual alarms are also provided.  Process parameters and setpoints are dislayed at the PLC interfaces.\n\nOverpressurization of system components is provided through process safety shutdowns sensed by transmitters and pressure switches.  Dual pressure relief valves are installed on all process equipment vessels, heat exchangers, and equipment to prevent systems from exceeding their design conditions.\n\nProcess areas are equipped with ammonia detection monitoring systems that provide audible alarms that alert personnel of high ammonia levels.",

Accidental relase prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Cherokee County Cogeneration Partner's L.P. facility is an 80 megawatt combined cycle cogeneration facility.  The facility generates electricity which is sold through a power purchase agreement to the host ultility.  The qualifying facility is a potable ice manufacturing facility which produces, stores, and markets ice to retail customers.\n\nThe refrigeration systems utilized at the facility contain anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  A specific refrigerant charge is solely contained within the piping, heat exchangers, and equipment that comprise the system.  The systems that monitor and control the refrigeration systems contain state of the art technology that initiates alarms, as well as protective shutdowns, to ensure the safe operation of the system. \n\nThe personnel who manage, operate, and maintain the facility are trained to observe all precautions required to safely handle ammonia at the facility.  This not only minimizes their exposure to a hazardous chemical, it also minimizes the threat to nearby members of the surrounding community.\n\nThe facility is staffed 24 hrs. a day and the personnel are trained in the use of emergency response equippment to minimize a chemical releases at the facility.  Our emergency response and preparedness plan includes procedures for notifying the County Emergency Preparedness Center in the event that a chemical release may affect the surrounding community.\n\n2. Stationary Source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to produce, store, and market potable quality ice.  The refrigeration system is a closed system that requires periodic makeup on a minimal basis.  Ammonia detection systems alert personnel of leaks in process areas.  Periodic leak checks are performed to ensure a tight, leak free system is maintained.  The total inventory of ammonia within these systems is 35,000 pounds.  Ammonia is not st"

Worst -case and alternative case release scenerios.\n\nWorst-Case Scenerio-Failure of ammonia storage tank used for maintenance activities at the facility.  This scenerio assumes that 10,000 pounds of ammonia stored as a liquid under pressure is released due to a catastropic failure of the storage tank.  The distance to the toxic endpoint would be 1.2 miles assuming the worst case conditions assumed in RMP*Comp.  The likelyhood of this senerio is minimal for several reasons:\n1. This is the maximum amount that is allowed to be stored in the tank through plant administrative procedures.\n2. The tank is located in a concrete containment area that allows limited acessibility from outside influences (ie. forklifts, cranes, vehicles) that could comprimise the integrity of the tank.\n3. The tank is used only during maintenance or emergency situations to evacuate ammoina from affected systems.\n\nThe facility also modeled this scenerio ulitilizing atmospheric conditions more usual for the site and the resulting toxic endpoint is reduced to .2 miles. (Class D stability, wind speed 3 meters/sec)\n\nAlternative-Case Scenerio-Several scenerios were modeled for flange leaks, transfer line failures.  The amount of ammonia released over a ten minute period at rates 100 lbs./min down to 10 lbs./min resulted in distances to toxic endpoints of .1 miles.  This distance would not affect the surrounding community.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention and specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with all state and federal codes and regulations.  The facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The facility is constructed with materials and equipment designed for ammonia refrigeration use in accordance with all applicable codes and standards.\n\n5.
