The owners, mangement and employees of Sprague Grange Supply Inc., 316 South Colfax Street, Sprague, Washington 99032, with fertilizer branch operations located at First and B Street, Sprague, Washington 99032 and 33435 SR 28 East, Harrington, Washington 99134 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facilities are prepared to work with the local fire department and other government agencies to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.  2. Facility information - The Anhydrous Ammonia facility was completed and ready for storage and delivery of product as of June 1, 2004.
