Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs, and considerable time and resources have been invested in this effort.  \n\nThe plant has detailed procedures to ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of each process.  Plant personnel receive regular safety training, and employee input is solicited on every aspect of safety performance improvement.  Failure to follow safety policies is grounds for dismissal.\n\nIf a release were to occur, trained personnel would control and contain the release.  The standard procedure is to technically evaluate each situation, identify potential on-site and off-site impacts, evacuate or shelter employees as necessary, contain the release and contact the local fire department to control the release and minimize its consequences.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE \n\nThe Cognis Oleochemicals LLC Cincinnati, Ohio plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located at 4900 Este Avenue.  A variety of processes are operated at the plant to produce products derived from animal fat or vegetable oil.  The plant, originally constructed in 1885, is situated on 105 acres of land. Of this, about 70 acres have been developed. Part of the plant is located in the City of Cincinnati and part is located in the City of St. Bernard.  The two parts are separated by the Mill Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River.  Fatty Acids, Glycerins and Ozone Acids are the major products produced at the Cincinnati plant. \n\nThe plant is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and is regularly inspected by agency representatives.

Ammonia, which is regulated as toxic substance, is used as a refrigerant in the Solvent Separation process.  Hydrogen, which is regulated as a flammable substance, is used as a process ingredient in the Hydrogenation processes that are part of the Stearic Acid manufacturing operations.  All of these processes have been assigned to RMP Program Level 3.\n\nNOTE:  The reporting of this Hydrogen system is a duplicate reporting. The system has also been reported by Air Products, Inc. (EPA ID # 1000 0001 8358). The system is completely owned, operated and maintained by Air Products but is located on property owned by Cognis Corporation and within the fence line of a Cognis operating facility. The Hydrogen stored within the system is supplied to the Cognis Oleochemicals LLC facility. The dual reporting is by mutual consent of both companies.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nFollowing U. S. EPA guidance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA included both worst-case release scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Considering the design of the regulated processes and the plant's accident prevention programs, it is virtually impossible for the WCSs to occur.  Although it is highly unlikely that the ARSs would ever occur, the ARSs represe"

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cincinnati plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents, and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets. This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards. For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) maintained in the process operating procedures.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates the hazards associated with a process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigating options in response to a PHA is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least once every five years, and they will continue to be conducted at this frequency until the process is deco"

A key element of the plant's protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, plant personnel are prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\nThe plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from local emergency response organizations.\n\nThe plant's Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP plan describes the incidents that would have the most catastrophic effects (the worst-case release scenarios) and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (alternative release scenarios). Although it is technically infeasible for the worst-case release scenarios described in this plan to occur, the information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to incidents of lesser magnitude, which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using RMP*Comp (Ver 1.07), which was developed by U. S. EPA for accidental chemical release modeling.\n\nCOGNIS OLEOCHEMICALS LLC\n\nCognis Corporation carved out the Fatty Acid, Glycerine, Ozone Acids and Plastics Technology Businesses creating Cognis Oleochemicals LLC in January 2006.\n\nThe Cognis Oleochemicals LLC manufacturing facility is"

Most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are possible.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  The RMP regulations require companies to report all significant releases from regulated processes that occurred during the past five years.  The plant has not had any releases subject to reporting.  There have been a few small chemical releases, but none of them had an offsite impact.  Plant personnel are available to answer any related questions.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Cincinnati plant.  Since processes at the plant that are regulated under the RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Cincinnati plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  They are reviewed periodically and certified annually as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change (MOC) process. In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond should an upset situation occur, such as an electrical outage or process alarm.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and is provided to other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable le"
