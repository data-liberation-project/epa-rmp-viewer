It is our policy to update our equipment whenever improvements become available.  Norway Spur Farmers Coop has programs in place to insure that our employees are trained to maintain, inspect, and operate our equipment in a safe manner.\n\nNorway Spur Farmers Coop wants to insure the public that the use of anhydrous ammonia is safe.
