The primary purpose of this facility is to use propane fo grain drying.Propane is recived be transport truck and stored in a 30,000 gal. tank.This facility has equipment for unloading transports and equipment to load bobtails.The maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this facility is 110,000 pounds.     The worse case release would be the failure of the storage tank which,when filled to the maximum amount allowed would release 110,000 pounds of propane.Policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 88% at 60 F.It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor,which finds an ignition source.10% of the released quantity is assumedto participate in the resulting explosion.      The distance to the end point of 1 psi for the worst case scenario is .39 miles.       The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.The resulting unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit.     The distance to the end point for the lower flammability limit for alterative scenario is .06 miles.This release has possibility of extending beyond the facility boundry.    This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.    There have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that:have caused any deaths,injuries,or property damage  :have resulted in offsite deaths,injuries,evacuations,shelter in place,property damage,or evironmental damage.      Saftey improvements is an on going process at this "
