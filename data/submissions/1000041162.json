The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\nThe Silver Oak Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Silver Oak Gas Plant is located approximately 3 miles east of Mineral, Texas, on County Road 107. Targa operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\r\n\r\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\r\n2. Condensate\r\n3. Residue Gas\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) RESULTS\r\n\r\nTarga treats the entire gas plant as one process.  Several vessels at the gas plant were evaluated for offsite consequence analyses.  There are three worst-case scenarios (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Silver Oak Gas Plant.  The first involves 292,200 pounds (60,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in one of two interconnected natural gas liquid storage tanks. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resultin"

The second scenario involves one set of condensate inlet slug catcher tubes and results in a vapor cloud explosion of 296,413 pounds (62,200 gallons) of flammable mixture. The third scenario involves the natural gas liquids surge tank at Plant 2 and results in a vapor cloud explosion of 309,245 pounds (63,500 gallons) of flammable mixture.  The second and third scenarios also impact a 0.5 mile radius; however, different off-site receptors are impacted in each scenario. Therefore, all three scenarios are included in this plan. \r\n\r\nSince the facility is located in a populated area, each WCS could affect offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  Targa has numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage one's consequences. Passive mitigation measures include an automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and actuated valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at Silver Oak Gas Plant is assumed to be the release of 37,499 pounds (7,700 gallons) of the flammable mixture from the natural gas liquid pump moving product to the pipeline exiting the plant. This creates a vapor cloud explosion with a 0.3 mile radius. The release is expected to be isolated by plant operation personnel within 10 minutes, to manually shut down the pump from the control room. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Silver Oak Gas Plant is covered by the OSHA PSM Program to aid in accident release prevention. \r\n\r\nA. Employee Participation\r\n\r\nTarga encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\r\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\r\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\r\n4. Participating as a m"

These technical documents address the following:\r\n\r\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\r\n2. Necessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\r\n3. Maximum intended inventories\r\n4. Upper and Lower limits of process fixed and rotating equipment\r\n5. Equipment design basis and configuration information\r\n6. Identification of all necessary regulatory equipment design documents\r\n7. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\r\n\r\nThe location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM Program.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet (MSDS).  For specific areas within the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator's procedures manual.  The facility maintains the overall process within these limits by using controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. \r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed facility changes to safety features are not compromised. \r\n\r\nC.

New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test or hands-on observation specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\r\n\r\nF. Contractors\r\n\r\nThe Silver Oak Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

There have been no accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nTarga's Silver Oak Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Targa staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.  The Silver Oak Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \r\n\r\nORGANIZATIONAL CHART"
