      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Dow Victoria Site of The Dow Chemical Company is committed to operating all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment. These programs include both internal Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Dow Victoria Site consists of 38 acres, located approximately 9 miles south of the city of Victoria, in a rural setting south of SH 185.  The plant functions as a \"tenant\" on the larger INVISTA Victoria Plant site.\n\nThe plant consists of one manufacturing process producing Ethylene Copolymers (low-density Polyethylene resins).  In the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used:  \nRMP Toxic Chemical - Vinyl Acetate\nRMP Flammable Chemicals - Ethylene, Propane, and Propylene\n\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic chemical is a release of 185,000 lbs. of Vinyl Acetate from a railcar.   This release has an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the \"RMP Comp\" software.  No mitigation was assumed for the analysis, but depending on the location of the railcar, the following mitigations could be in place to mitigate the consequences of the event:\n1) Operator attendance during loading/unloading to determine the condition of railcars and observe leaks.  Cameras are also available for monitoring.\n2)  Preventive maintenance program on the railcars and loading/unloading facilities.\n3)  Combustible Gas Detectors to detect flammable vapors and alert personnel.\n\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE"

This release, if ignited, would have an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the \"RMP Comp\" software.  The ignition of this release is unlikely because the tank is located in a remote location versus normal ignition sources.  No mitigation was assumed for the analysis, but the following mitigations are in place to mitigate the consequences of the event: \n1) Surveillance: Personnel make rounds to determine the condition of equipment and observe leaks.  Cameras are also available for surveillance.\n2) Tank pressure and level are alarmed and are monitored remotely via DCS.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nVinyl acetate monomer (VA) - A leak from the Vinyl Acetate storage tank with mitigation from secondary containment was assumed.  Other mitigation includes Combustible Gas Detectors to detect flammable vapors and alert personnel.  This release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the \"RMP Comp\" software.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nPropane - A BLEVE from the Propane Tank was assumed.  This release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the \"RMP Comp\" software.  The ignition of this release is unlikely because the tank is located in a remote location versus normal ignition sources.
