The chlorine is used for disinfection of wastewater and the sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination.  As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency responsibilities have been instituted which include: operating and maintaining procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide, notification of trained personnel, immediately available SCBA and protective equipment to be used only by trained personnel, an emergency action plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event that local emergency response is needed. \n\nRelease scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configurations at the facility.  The release scenarios have been performed in accordance with the regulation.\nNo accidents have occurred in the last five years. Procedures are in place to identify and record any future accidents or incidents. \nThe City plans to continue updating the program as required and will review the program every five years or when on-site condition change such as processes, quantities, or other items causing a decrease or increase in the distance to the endpoint by a factor of two."
