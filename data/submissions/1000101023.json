For modeling purposes, it is assumed that the cyclohexylamine from the release will form a pool at 1 cm deep.

The site is a member of the Greater Houston Local Emergency Planning Committee (GHLEPC) and has a written emergency preparedness plan that is reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\r\nThe Solenis Houston Plant receives, and stores chemicals used primarily water treatment industrial applications.  The facility handles one RMP regulated chemical - cyclohexylamine.  Cyclohexylamine is received in UN Specification drum container, mixed with water and other chemicals in a blend vessel, packaged, and shipped to customers.  The threshold quantity of cyclohexylamine is exceeded in the outdoor storage area and production building.\r\nThe Worst-Case scenario involving a release of approximately 18,000 lbs. of cyclohexylamine from site Mix Vessel F which would contain a 40,000-pound batch of a boiler chemistry product containing approximately 45% cyclohexylamine.  The resulting release due to a catastrophic failure of the Mix Vessel F is assumed to form a pool of cyclohexylamine 1 cm deep on the concrete pad.  Worst case atmospheric conditions of a 1.5 meter/second wind speed and Class F stability conditions are assumed.  The ALOHA model from EPA's website was used.
