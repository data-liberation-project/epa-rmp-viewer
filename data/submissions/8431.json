The Seattle plant produces ice cream, milk, milk \nproducts, and juice for distribution throughout the Puget Sound region.  \n\nPlant operations include bulk milk receiving and storage, milk processing, ice cream \nmanufacture, packaging, warehousing, and shipping.  \n\nThe plant uses a mechanical ammonia refrigeration system to chill the product during \nprocessing and cool the cold storage warehouse that is used to store the product before \nshipment.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia at various locations \nthroughout the plant.  At any given time, 27,000 pounds of ammonia is typically stored \nand used at the facility.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nDuring the past 5 years, Darigolds Rainier Avenue Plant has not experienced any \nammonia releases that resulted in any injuries, offsite evacuations, or property damage.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nDarigolds Rainier Avenue Plant is subject to OSHAs Process Safety Management \n(PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with the ammonia \nrefrigeration system.  In response to safety reviews performed as part of EPAs ARPP, \nDarigolds safety management system is being upgraded to include the following PSM \nelements to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n\nx Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the ammonia system to \nassess their proper design and installation.\n \nx Review of standard operating procedures for the ammonia system.  All \nprocedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n \nx Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls for the \nammonia system, with detailed documentation of all inspections.\n \nx Prompt corrective action for any non-conformin"

The \nkey elements of the Emergency Action Plan are as follows:\n \nx All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) receives training in the \nspecific elements of the program.\n \nx Several supervisors and operators are trained, certified, and equipped for \nhazardous materials (HazMat) emergency operations to repair accidental \nreleases in areas of high ammonia concentration.\n \nx Darigold is currently installing electronic ammonia gas detectors with audible \nalarms.  The plant uses a combination of its 2-way radio system and its plant-\nwide loudspeaker system to alert staff of a potential accident and to conduct \nin-plant communications.\n \nx In the event of a large release, the facility would contact the Seattle Fire \nDepartment.  Darigolds HazMat team and the Fire Department would jointly \nconduct emergency response actions and repair the ammonia leak.\n \n \n PLANT UPGRADES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \n As a result of the safety reviews conducted as part of the ARPP, Darigold is \nimplementing the following upgrades to improve plant safety:\n \nx Install ammonia gas detectors at several processes inside the plant to improve \nemerge"

EPA requires facilities to model the distance that a plume of \nreleased gas would travel before being dispersed to an ambient concentration equal to \nthe Toxic Endpoint Concentration.  The EPA-specified Toxic Endpoint Concentrations \nfor various compounds are those concentrations that would cause no permanent harm \nbut could interfere with peoples ability to leave the area.  The Toxic Endpoint \nConcentration for ammonia is 200 parts per million (ppm).  \n\nDarigold evaluated a wide range of hypothetical accidents that could result in releases of \nammonia.  In accordance with EPAs rule, two hypothetical accidental release scenarios \nwere developed:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario \n\nIn this scenario, the entire contents of the largest ammonia vessel (the 2,700-pound \noutdoor ammonia delivery tank) are accidentally released in a 10-minute period.  EPA \nrequires this extreme worst-case scenario to be evaluated for the Risk Management \nPlan, but Darigold knows of no event that could realistically cause such a large release. \nHowever, in accordance with this worst-case scenario, it is assumed that the release \noccurs during a period of exceptionally calm, stagnant conditions (1.5 meter/second \nwind speed and F stability) that would result in the highest downwind concentrations.  \nGraphs from EPAs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration indicate the gas cloud "

Figure 1 is a map that shows the circle defined by the \n0.65-mile downwind distance.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario \n\nDarigold conducted a safety review to assess a range of accidents that could cause \nammonia releases large enough to affect people beyond the facility boundary.  The \nreview team selected the following hypothetical accident as the Alternate Release \nScenario.  Note that this scenario incorporates the ammonia gas detectors and \nautomatic shutoff systems described in the Plant Upgrades to Improve Safety section \nof this Executive Summary.\n\nA flexible hose on one of the 12 plates on the plate freezer suddenly breaks, causing all \nof the ammonia inside the plate to spill onto the floor of the freezer room.  In reality, a \nworn hose would probably develop a slow pinhole leak that would be easily detected and \nrepaired before the hose broke.  However, to be conservative, it is assumed that the \nhose breaks instantaneously, before the electronic gas detector inside the freezer room \ncan automatically shut off the system and alert the operators before the break occurs. \nUnder this conservative scenario, 241 pounds of liquid ammonia spills onto the floor of \nthe freezer room and begins to evaporate.  The thermodynamic properties of ammonia \ndictate that 18 percent (i.e., 43 pounds) of the spilled liquid immediately flashes to \nvapor.  The remainder of the spilled liquid immediately cools to ammonias boiling point \ntemperature (-28 degrees F), forms a puddle of liquid ammonia, and slowly evaporates.   \n\nThe gas detector inside the freezer room automatically shuts off the freezer pumps and \ncloses the rooms louvers to prevent the release from spreading to other parts of the \nbuilding.  The rooms ventilation fan then discharges the evaporating ammonia to the \nrooftop emergency vent.  It is assumed that Darigolds HazMat team arrives at the \nscene 10 mi"
