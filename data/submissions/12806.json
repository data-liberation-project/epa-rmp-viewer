The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nUniversity of California, Davis operates a wastewater treatment facility, UCD Wastewater Treatment Plant, located at the end of Putah Creek Lodge Drive, on the UCD campus in Davis, CA in Yolo County, and uses chlorine for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  There are 6 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales and storage trunnions inside the building.  The chlorine is used for odor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the wastewater effluent, and for other process uses.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is withdrawn under pressure and pipe"

From there, the chlorine under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators located in a separate room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of University of California, Davis that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, University of California, Davis has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA single \"worst case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum distance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on site above the threshold quantity.\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of 10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of the contents of the largest container of chlorine on site, in this case 2,000 lb.  This release scenario is not physically possible, due to the characteristics of chlorine.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn \"alternative case\" release scen"

The \"alternative case\" considered for this facility is the release of 2 pounds of chlorine gas from a ton container over a period of 1 minute due to an error during hookup, with the release secured by the operator closing the gas valve.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at University of California, Davis which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include University of California, Davis's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the timely response of a trained operator following written procedures.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by University of California, Davis are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\nUniversity of California, Davis has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection and de"

The program and document mangement procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, modifying the pressure piping at the header to improve accessibilty to the ton containers, and creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps..\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nUniversity of California, Davis's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with the U C Davis Fire Department, the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies. It consists of notifying the Fire Department and evacuating persons on site and in the vicinity to designated assembly areas upwind of the release.   First Responders have participated with University of California, Davis personnel in response drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA replacement wastewater treatment plant not using chlorine in the process is under construction and will be completed in the fall of 1999.  At that time, the chlorine facilities at the UCD Wastewater Treatment Plant on Putah Creek Lodge Drive will be demolished.  All of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which University of California, Davis committed to accomplish have been completed.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys in the interim period prior to decommissioning of the chlorine facilities will be thoroughly revi"
