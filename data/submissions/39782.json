      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment. They are transported on roads, water, and railways. The San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) uses chemicals, too. We use chlorine and sulfur dioxide to disinfect treated wastewater to provide safe water for discharge to the environment and for reclaimed water uses such as landscaping and irrigation. We also use ammonia in combination with chlorine to create chloramine, which is a more stable disinfectant. Storing large qualities of these chemicals can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using hazardous chemicals as seriously as we take providing reliable wastewater treatment. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accidental chemical release, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operated plant, and how we respond to an emergency. To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidental releases. Please feel free to contact Ronald L. Garner, Deputy Director/Plant Manager at (408) 945-5300 if you have any questions.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of the City of San Jose and the WPCP to develop, maintain, and implement this Risk Management Plan/Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Program. This RMP/PSM Program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP), under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, and the Process Safety Management Program under CCR Title 8, Division 1, Chapter 4, Section 5189.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe WPCP is located in north San Jose near the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay. It treats wastewater from the cities of San Jose, Santa C"

Plant processes include pretreatment to remove large solids and grit, primary treatment to remove settleable solids, biological treatment to remove dissolved organic waste and to convert ammonia to nitrates, filtration to remove suspended solids, and disinfection to kill and inactivate disease-causing organisms.\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, sulfur dioxide, digester gas, which are regulated substances under both the Federal RMP and CalARP regulations, and 19.5 percent aqueous ammonia, which is regulated under CalARP only. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used in the disinfection process and are stored in 90-ton rail cars that contain no more than 45 tons of chlorine or sulfur dioxide when brought onsite. The amounts of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored onsite exceed the RMP and CalARP rule threshold quantities. Therefore, the disinfection process is subject to both regulations. Aqueous ammonia at a concentration of 19.5 percent by weight is stored in two 8,000-gallon double-walled tanks located in a bermed containment area. The amount of ammonia stored onsite exceeds the CalARP rule Table 3 threshold. Therefore, the aqueous ammonia process is subject only to the Cal ARP regulation. Digester gas is stored in digester domes, a gas holding tank, and process piping. Calculations maintained at the WPCP demonstrate that the amount of digester gas stored does not exceed the RMP and CalARP rule thresholds. Therefore, the digester process is not subject to either regulation.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are both used in the disinfection process but are stored, transported, and applied in physically separate but similar systems. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are brought to the site in railcars, which are also used as storage. Up to four chlorine railcars and three sulfur dioxide railcars can be on"

The railcars are hooked up to the separate chlorine and sulfur dioxide delivery systems by flexible connectors. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are conveyed in piping as liquids to buildings housing evaporators that convert the liquid chemicals to gases under controlled conditions. Gas is drawn under vacuum from the evaporators through flow control devices called chlorinators or sulfonators, which regulate the amount of gas that is dissolved into the wastewater. Chlorine is added to the wastewater to kill disease-causing organisms and is also used to control odors. Sulfur dioxide is used to remove any remaining chlorine after disinfection is completed to protect flora and fauna in the receiving water.\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems have a number of safety systems and are in full compliance with Santa Clara County\u00bfs stringent Toxic Gas Ordinance (TGO). Safety provisions include:\n- The flexible hoses from the railcars, valve tree cabinets, and outdoor piping are equipped with secondary containment that is vented to a scrubber system.\n- Indoor piping is contained by the buildings themselves. The buildings are vented to the scrubber system. \n- Sulfur dioxide and chlorine leak detectors are provided to detect leaks within the railcar dome, flexible hose secondary containment, valve tree cabinets, outdoor piping secondary containment, at the base of the railcars, and inside the rooms where chlorine or sulfur dioxide is processed. The leak detectors are connected to a PLC system that automatically starts the scrubber system and activates audible and visual alarms. Automated dampers are used to direct air flow to the scrubber from the appropriate containment area.\n- Automatic shutoff valves are provided immediately downstream of the railcar connection and at the entry to each processing room.

In addition, the railcar area is video monitored by the computer control room.\n- An emergency generator is provided for backup power to the leak detection, alarm, and scrubber system in the event of a power failure.\n- The railcars include internal excess flow valves that are designed to close in the event of a catastrophic failure of the flexible hose or piping.\n- A seismic detection switch is provided that is designed to automatically close the automatic shutoff valves in the event of a major earthquake.\n\nAmmonia at a strength of 19.5 percent by weight, is brought to the facility in tanker trucks. The ammonia is stored in two double-walled, storage tanks. A concrete berm around the tanks provides triple containment of the ammonia. Ammonia is metered into the wastewater to later combine with chlorine to create chloramines, a more stable and efficient disinfection agent than free chlorine.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, or ammonia in the last five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. In the 32 years that these chemicals have been used onsite, the WPCP has had no accidental release that has required offsite response.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe WPCP chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are required to have a stringent release prevention and emergency response program by both the Process Safety"

The WPCP RMP/PSM Plan described herein addresses the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.\n\nAqueous ammonia storage is not regulated under PSM. Because there have been no accidents in the last five years and because it does not have the potential for an offsite impact, the aqueous ammonia process is not required to have formal accidental release prevention and emergency response programs. However, ammonia is a hazardous material and its safe storage and use is governed by other regulations. WPCP maintains appropriate measures and safeguards on handling and storage of aqueous ammonia to protect its employees and the public.\n\nOur RMP/PSM Plan  is based on the following key elements:\n- Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n- Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n- Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n- A completed process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n- Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n- Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with operations and maintenance staff participation.\n- High level of training of operators and maintenance staff.\n- Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff.\n\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information\n\nComprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazards, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance.

The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers. The PHA technique used was the \u00bfHazard and Operability\u00bf (HAZOP) study, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The PHA was led by a knowledgeable person on the type of process being reviewed. The PHA was revalidated on April 12, 1999 and on April 1, 2004, and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process. A list of actions to resolve significant hazard review findings was prepared and staff is currently working to resolve this action item list. Staff will document completion of each action item.\n\nAn initial seismic assessment was performed in August 1993 by WGP Engineering, Inc. Additional seismic assessments were performed on April 16, 1999 and March 4, 2004 based on the Guidance for California Accidental Release Prevention Program Seismic Assessments prepared by the Los Angeles County Fire Department Hazmat Division. Recommendations from the seismic assessments were included in the PHA list of actions.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe WPCP maintains and certifies written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.

The WPCP training program helps employees understand the nature and cause of problems arising from operations involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide on site, and increases employees\u00bf awareness with respect to process hazards. The WPCP training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the processes, (2) the properties and hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and (3) a detailed review of process operating procedures and safe work practices. Demonstrations and field observations are used to verify that employees understand the training material.\n\nTraining documentation includes: date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required, and the type of competency testing used to ensure that staff understand the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe WPCP has procedures and policies in place that ensure that only contractors with good safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes. Contractors are informed of process hazards, process area access limitations, and emergency response procedures so that they may safely complete their work. The WPCP sets minimum contractor safety performance requirements to do work on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process area and equipment, holds contractor safety briefings before allowing contractors near or in the process area, controls access to proces"

We believe that this program is the primary line of defense against a release and addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The WPCP mechanical integrity program includes the following features:\n- Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes, and prior operating experience.\n- Implementation of the written procedures for performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\n- Training of maintenance personnel in procedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions.\n- Procedures specifying training requirements for contract maintenance employees, as well as requiring contractors to use specified maintenance procedures for process areas.\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nThe WPCP requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \u00bfhot work\u00bf in, on, or around the covered processes.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe WPCP has developed and implemented a system to manage changes or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions. This system allows employees to identify and review safety hazards, add safety, process, or chemical information to existing data, evaluate proposed changes to confirm that they would not compromise process safety,"

The WPCP assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable about the RMP/PSM Plan and about the process. This team evaluates whether the RMP/PSM Plan and its implementation satisfies the requirements of the RMP/CalARP and PSM requirements and whether the RMP/PSM Plan is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the RMP/PSM Plan are implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe WPCP investigates all incidents that caused or could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. The WPCP trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation. An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented. Incident investigation report findings are reviewed by affected staff and considered in revising operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe WPCP has established a written emergency response program that is followed by the employees to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. This program has been coordinated with the City of San Jose Fire Department, which is the local emergency response agency. The program includes an Emergency Response and Evacuation Plan specific to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes. Chlorine area operators are trained as first responders. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted every 12 month"

Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral recommendations to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes in the initial 1993 PHA and in the 1999 PHA Revalidation. These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as appropriate except for two actions that are still in the process of being implemented. These actions are installation of a cover over the railcar area, which is under construction, and modifications to the valve tree cabinets at the railcar unloading stations, which are undergoing management of change evaluation. \n\nSeveral additional safety improvements identified in the April 1, 2004 Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation have been selected for implementation. These are described in Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation Report (Appendix E)."
