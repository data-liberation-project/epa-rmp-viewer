Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Red Desert Gas Plant is located about 15 miles west of Wamsutter, Wyoming, just north of Interstate 80.  As of this resubmittal, the facility is shutdown but could be re-activated if needed.  The compression at the plant is being used to move gas to the Patrick Draw plant for processing.  All storage at the facility has been temporarily shut in and is not in use.  When running, the facility includes compression, dehydration, refrigerated liquids recovery and a refrigeration system.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, and a liquid product containing propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier liquids.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic.  There are no toxic release scenarios at the Red Desert plant.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThis narrative has been deleted as directed by the regulation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.

The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Red Desert Gas Plant employees are required to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process and employee safety issues.  These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, our A\u00bfSafe StartA\u00bf program and participation in flowsheet reviews. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Red Desert Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe Red Desert Gas Plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Red Desert Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Red Desert Gas Plant has used a modified A\u00bfWhat if ChecklistA\u00bf method of performing process hazard analysis (PHA) to evaluate the various processes associated with the facility.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Red Desert Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Red Desert Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors; 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with; 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, and 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the Red Desert Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Red Desert Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The basic aspects of this program include; 1) conducting training, 2) developing written procedures, 3) performing inspections and tests, 4) correcting identified deficiencies, and 5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  All of these activities are tracked and documented using Avantis, an asset manager database.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on; 1) an overview of the process, 2) safety and health hazards 3) applicable maintenance procedures, 4) emergency response plans, and 5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to verify that equipment parameters are within acceptable limits.  For a vessel the parameter being monitored would typically be wall thickness.
