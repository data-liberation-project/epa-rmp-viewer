The facility maintains safety information about the facility onsite and at the company offices. The facility was constructed according to good engineering practices. A hazard review (per Program Level 2 requirements) has been performed at the facility, and the action items have been resolved or will be resolved in a timely manner. There are operating procedures for the equipment at the facility. Employees at the facility are trained prior to starting work at the facility to ensure that they are able to safely operate the facility and safely react to any emergency. Their training primarily consists of work-related experience and on-the-job training. The facility maintains the equipment at the facility according to current industry standards. Any incidents at the site will be investigated thoroughly, with findings reported to all employees.\r\n\r\nThis facility is aware of the requirements in the areas of Safety, Hazard Reviews, written Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigations. To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance\" section of the facility's Risk Management Plan has been prepared and implemented. Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.  This facility processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL). High pressure gas from field wells is sent to a gas plant whereby NGL liquids are extracted and stored in one 18,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank. The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  The NGL is a mixture of hydrocarbons consis"

This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance\" part of the facility's Risk Management Plan as prepared for the facility. The  prevention program does discuss NGL which is the specific chemical contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nBecause this facility is a Program 2 covered process, a written emergency response program is required. This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for\r\nthe facility. Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this manual, and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release. Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.  The facility has not experienced an accident as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \r\n\r\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
