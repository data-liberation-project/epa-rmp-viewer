      "SummaryText": "Tacoma Water supplies drinking water to customers in Tacoma and surrounding areas.  Since 1913, Tacoma Water has used the Green River as its primary source of drinking water.  The Green River source can supply a maximum of 72 million gallons per day (MGD).  When water demand exceeds 72 MGD, Tacoma Water relies on ground water from in-town wells to make up the difference.  The ground water supply has a maximum capacity of 50 MGD.  Storage reservoirs throughout the water system provide added capacity to meet customer needs.\n\nTacoma Water adds chlorine to the drinking water supply to protect public health.  Several years ago, Tacoma Water conducted an in-house chlorination assessment to reduce or eliminate the use of chlorine-gas.  Originally, Tacoma Water had 10 chlorination sites, all of which used chlorine-gas.  After evaluating these chlorination sites, Tacoma Water determined that four sites could be eliminated if changes were made at other facilities.  Tacoma Water then evaluated if alternative chlorination systems, such as liquid or solid forms of chlorine, could be used at the remaining six chlorination facilities.  The liquid or solid forms of chlorine are safer than chlorine-gas for employees who handle chlorine and for neighbors who live near chlorination facilities.\n\nTacoma Water first evaluated alternative chlorination chemicals at unstaffed locations, because of concerns about employee response time in the event of an accident.  The evaluation determined that two facilities could use a solid form of chlorine (calcium hypochlorite) and two facilities could be re-designed to use liquid chlorine (sodium hypochlorite).  Tacoma Water made these changes in 1999.  Now, only two chlorination facilities continue to use chlorine-gas.\n\nThe two chlorination facilities, the Green River Headworks and McMillin Reservoir have employees on the premises eight hours a day, every day of the week.  These employees live in on-site housing at both locations.  Tacoma Water feels"

      "SummaryText": " eliminating chlorine-gas from eight of its original ten chlorination facilities has improved employee and public safety.  The two facilities that continue to use chlorine-gas use the best available method to chlorinate the drinking water.\n\nBoth the Headworks and McMillin chlorination systems are designed with redundant chlorine equipment to provide continuous chlorine feed.  While one chlorinator is operating, the other is idle and can be manually switched if necessary.  The two chlorinators are routinely switched, to make certain that both function properly.  At the Headworks, four one-ton chlorine containers provide chlorine-gas to the system, and at McMillin Reservoir, two one-ton chlorine containers are used.  Each location also has an equal number of stand-by tanks on-line that automatically transition when the in-use bank of containers becomes empty.  \n\nBoth Headworks and McMillin Reservoir chlorination systems are designed to operate in a safe manner.  Chlorinators operate on a vacuum principle that enables a safe transfer of chlorine from the container to the injection point.  The chlorine containers are connected via a manifold to a vacuum regulator.  A vacuum, created when water passes through a venturi, holds a pin within the vacuum regulator open to allow chlorine to be drawn to the injection point.  Should the vacuum line fail, the pin will automatically close and isolate the chlorine containers.  Other safety measures include having the chlorination system connected to an emergency engine-generator.  If there is loss of regular power, the system automatically switches to backup power to provide uninterrupted power to the chlorination equipment. \n \nSafety systems at both Headworks and McMillin Reservoir continuously monitor the chlorination process.  Three types of safety systems are present: chlorine-gas leak detectors, chlorine residual analyzers, and high/low vacuum switches.  Chlorine leak detectors are present in the chlorine tank room and chlorin"

Chlorine residual analyzers monitor the chlorine feed into the water supply.  Each analyzer is tied to high/low residual alarms monitored continuously by computer.  These alarms may indicate an abnormal functioning of the system.  High/low vacuum switches on the system indicate possible problems with the chlorine supply or water supply.  These switches are also continuously monitored by computer and can trigger an alarm.   All alarms are transmitted locally to on-site operators and to the operator on-duty at the Water Control Center in Tacoma.  An operator is on duty at the Water Control Center 24 hours a day.  At the Headworks alarms are also sent to the home of the on-site operator.\n\nIn December 2002, Tacoma Water completed its year long audit of both chlorination facilities as part of its OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Plan requirements.  The audit addressed major sections such as operating and maintenance, employee training, and emergency response.  All operating procedures were updated, all necessary maintenance tasks were identified and the preventive maintenance schedule was revised.  The employee chlorine training program was rewritten to include more site-specific training for both Headworks and McMillin Reservoir.  Emergency response plans for both the Headworks and McMillin Reservoir were updated.  At both facilities, employees are trained and routinely drilled to properly use self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and personal protective equipment.\n\nTacoma Water and local emergency response agencies conduct chlorine emergency response drills annually to evaluate response procedures and capabilities.  At the Headworks, an employee is present every day for an eight-hour day shift.  At other times, an employee who lives on-site is designated to immediately respond to any alarms.

None of these fire departments has a team equipped to directly handle a chlorine-gas release.  But, the Kent Emergency Response Team has an agreement with Fire District #47 to provide hazardous materials assistance for the Headworks, as needed.\n\nThe McMillin Reservoir facility has a minimum of one employee present every day for an eight-hour work shift.  McMillin Reservoir staff are given on-site housing but are not required to be present during non-working hours.  Chlorine residual and chlorine-gas leak alarms sound a horn at the chlorine plant and are also transmitted to the Water Control Center in Tacoma.  During working hours, on-site employees immediately respond.  During non-working hours, the operator on-duty at the Water Control Center first contacts McMillin Reservoir staff to respond.  If they are not available, the control center operator contacts Central Pierce County Fire & Rescue and Tacoma Water staff at the utility?s Enumclaw office.  Central Pierce County Fire & Rescue has a hazardous materials team nearby, and can respond within 5-10 minutes.\n\nFor more than 85 years, Tacoma Water has used chlorine-gas at both the Headworks and McMillin Reservoir without any serious problems.  To continue this record, operators, engineers, and maintenance staff routinely review and update chlorine operations procedures, the preventive maintenance program, and the chlorine safety program.  And, Tacoma Water maintains a working relationship with its chlorine-gas supplier to ensure chlorine containers are maintained properly.  The compliance audits and annual emergency response drills with local emergency response agencies verify the continued safe operation of our chlorine-gas systems."
