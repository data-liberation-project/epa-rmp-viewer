Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Oregon Freeze Dry are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers aareas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Albany Fire Department, who provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  the maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 72,246 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis:\n\nThe first Worst-Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Oregon Freeze Dry's Plant 1.  The scenario involves the release of 3999 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 237.5.  A distance to endpoint of 1.6 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 9763 within this distance.  \n\nT"

This scenario involves the release of 1700 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 170 and a distance to endpoint of .31 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 195.\n\nThe second Alternative-Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Oregon Freeze Dry's Plant 2.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility, which includes all three of our manufacturing plants, has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Two processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary sources.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs"

The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-IF/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Oregon Freeze Dry maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at lease annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.

Process operators, maintenance pers;onnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modificiation.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular ppractice at Oregon Freeze Dry.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry conducts audits in a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of an regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports aare retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
