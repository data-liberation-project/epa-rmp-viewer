If ana ccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n    -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n    - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n    - The maximum quantity stored would be 131,000 pounds in our one - 30,000 gallon storage tank at 85% maximum capacity.\n\n3. Accidental release prevention program:\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61 published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupatioal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n4.The 5 year accident history:\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility. Neither have there been a release that, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\n5. The emergency response program:\nThe facility has a written Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employe training. A copy of the Emergency Response Plan has been given to the local fire department and to the Local Emergency Planning Committee. The facility submits annual right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:"
