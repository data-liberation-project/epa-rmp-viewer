      "SummaryText": "The management of Louisiana Generating, LLC, owner and operator of the Big Cajun 2 Power Plant, is committed to safe and environmentally sound operation of the plant.  Big Cajun 2 Power Plant is a three-unit coal-fired power plant located on a 2000-acre site on the Mississippi River near New Roads, Louisiana.  The mission of the power plant is to produce electricity for eleven electric cooperatives located throughout Louisiana.  The plant burns Wyoming sub-bituminous coal in its boilers and utilizes Mississippi River water for cooling and boiler make-up water.\n\nBig Cajun 2 Power Plant is dedicated to a safe working environment.  A Corporate Safety Policy was instituted in 1983 and revised in 1992.  A Safety Manual is provided to each employee of the plant.  Management incorporates training in safe-handling practices of hazardous materials and in fire-fighting techniques on a regular basis.  The Training Department provides Hazard Communications (HazCom) and Emergency Response Team (ERT) training.    \n\nChemical Process Covered by This Risk Management Plan\n\nChlorine is the only substance utilized at this facility that is regulated under the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program requirements in 40 CFR Part 68.  Chlorine is used in the Water Chlorination Process in three areas \u00c2\u00bf the Circulating Water (cooling tower) area, the Pretreatment Water area, and the Potable Water area.  Chlorine is delivered to the site in one-ton and 150-pound cylinders.  Each cylinder is transferred by the delivery driver from the delivery truck and positioned in a bulk storage rack.  A bulk storage rack is present in each area.  All chlorine storage areas are well ventilated and require minimal exposure to personnel.\n\nAt the Circulating Water area, the storage rack holds up to twelve one-ton cylinders.  The function of the Circulating Water chlorination system is to add chlorine to the Circulating Water intermittently (approximately two hours per day per cooling tower) for the purpose of killing p"

The chlorinator can supply chlorine at a rate of 4,000 pounds per day.  At this location, only one chlorine container is in service at any time.  Visual and audible alarms are provided for the Circulating Water chlorination system and are acknowledged in the Unit 3 Control Room.  The alarms alert emergency personnel when triggered by the detection of chlorine gas (Chloralert system) and/or the detection of pressure and temperature changes in the process.\n\nAt the Pretreatment Water area, the storage rack holds up to six one-ton cylinders.  The function of the Pretreatment Water chlorination system is to supply chlorine continuously to the River Water Header to prevent or retard the growth of water-philous organisms in three clarifiers.  The system includes two small, separate gaseous chlorinators, each rated to supply chlorine at about 100 pounds per day.  Only one chlorine container is in service at each chlorinator at any time. \n\nAt the Potable Water area, the storage rack holds up to ten 150-pound cylinders.  The function of the Potable Water chlorination system is to supply chlorine continuously to the Potable Water Headers to prevent or retard the growth of water-philous organisms.  The system includes two small feed lines that supply chlorine to the water as it is being pumped into two larger storage tanks.  Flow in the water lines creates a vacuum in the feed lines, transferring the chlorine from the cylinders into the headers.  Each line feeds chlorine at approximately five pounds per day.\n\nAny major or minor maintenance to the chlorinators is performed by a factory certified vendor under the supervision of the water systems operator.  The vendor qualifications are scrutinized by the PSM team, Safety and Securities department.  A buddy system is used for general maintenance or changing chlorine cylinders.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe guidanc"

Based on the model\u00c2\u00bfs calculation of the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release of chlorine, the area surrounding the plant that could potentially be adversely affected by any chlorine release does not include any public receptors.      \n\nChemical Safety Program\n\nBig Cajun 2 Power Plant complies with the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations of the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA).  The plant has an on-site safety training facility and full-time on-site training personnel.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years, Big Cajun 2 Power Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on-site or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, or property or environmental damage for the covered process.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nBig Cajun 2 Power Plant trains personnel in HazCom and fire-fighting methods.  Incident Commander training has been conducted, and ERT personnel are on-site 24 hours per day.  Personnel assigned to the ERT receive a minimum of one hour of training per month on various safety items and eight hours of training per year in fire fighting.  \n\nA public address system is located throughout the plant site.  An audible alarm sound followed by verbal communication will alert the ERT.  Alarms located at the Circulating Water and Pretreatment Water areas will alert personnel of a possible chlorine leak.  The Potable Water area is visually inspected for leaks on a regular basis.\n\nThe Shift Supervisor on duty at the plant serves as the Incident Commander for emergency response.
