Common to all components of the system is a twenty point organic vapor monitoring device that alarms at 15 ppm EO.  We intend to install three water canons which will serve as a fire surpression system for [1], [2], [3] and [5].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [1] The EO rail car - the temperature is monitored twice daily.  We intend to install a dike under the rail car.  The contents of the dike will be routed to a containment area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          [3] The centrifugal pumps - have double mechanical seals with a low barrier fluid shut down as well as high temperature  and low amperage (dry run) shut offs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               [4] & [5] Bulk EO storage tank (T-22) and bulk PO storage tank (T-19) -  have high and low level alarms, high and lower pressure alarms and a high temperature alarm.  T-22 is also fitted with a water deluge system.  T-22 is enclosed in a bunker.  T-19 is diked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     [6] Intermediate storage vessels - these vessels have high and low pressure alarms and high temperature alarms.  We intend to install sprinkler systems on these vessels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      [7]  The reactor pumps - have hyrdraulic fluid contamination shut-offs and high pressure automatic bypasses to avoid excessive pressure if 'dead headed'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     [8] The reactors - have high temerature and pressure alarms.

Whatever its form, it may present a potentially serious threat to Company operations, and to the health and safety of employees and the community.  Some emergencies - for example, chemical releases - are governed by strict federal, state and local laws.  Therefore, it is essential for all employees to be aware of potential emergency situations, to plan for them, and to take prompt and effective response should an emergency event actually occur.\n\nThe purpose of these procedures are to provide information and to establish guidelines in preparing for and response to emergencies.  The procedures include reporting requirements, emergency communication, evacuation plans, and other vital information needed to put response plans into action.\n\nThe procedures are divided into sections so that quick reference and action are facilitated.  All employees are expected to be familiar with these procedures and to review them routinely. {source EMG. PROCED. Section 1, page 1}\n\nThe Janesville plant is committed to safety.  The plant has developed site emergency response procedures and actively participates in the Rock County District Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Site officials work closely with the local fire department and safety and environmental consultants.  Air and water monitoring are performed regularly to ensure compliance with all permits and regulations. {source EMG. PROCED. Section 1, page 2}\n\nThe facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nABITEC Corporation's Janesville production facility is a 7 acre site located at 1530 S. Jackson Street in Janesville, WI.  Chemical operations began at the site in 1962 with a major expansion (doubling capacity) in 1980.\n\nThe facility manufactures surface active agents (surfactants).  The principle products manufactured are food grade, Kosher certified specialty oils; and fabric softener bases "

      "SummaryText": "and other specialty surfactants.  The former are used in foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and personal care products.  The latter are used by formulators of dryer and rinse-cycle fabric softeners, detergents, lubricants and personal care products.\n\nThe Risk Management Program applies to this facility because ethylene oxide and propylene oxide may be on-site in excess of 10,000 pounds at any one time.\n\nWorst case release scenario(s) alternative release scenario(s):\n\nThe worst case senario is defined by the regulation as \"..the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to endpoint defined in Sec. 68.22(a).\"\n\nOur worst case scenario was determined using EPS's \"RMP OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS GUIDANCE\" dated May 24,1996.\n\nThe scenario, as required, describes the release of 180,000 pounds (a full railroad car) of ethylene oxide.\n\nThe radius of the off site consequence, using the above referenced method, is 9.9 miles.  The center of this circle is our facility at N 42.659 W 89.020 (using MARPLOT map).  The estimated population within this circle is 93,169 (using 1990 census data available at www.census.gov).\n\nThe above mentioned populations includes residential and business areas, schools, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, a correctional institution, and numerous parks, golf courses and other recreational facilities.\n\nAn alternative release of two hundred (200) pounds of ethylene oxide was considered.  Although this is a larger release than anything we have experienced in the last five years, we are aware of such a release at a facility practicing similar operations.  The radius of the off site consequences is sixty (60) yards with the only public receptor being a rail road siding.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is required to comply with the OHSA PSM rule.  We therefore have written operating procedures, etc."
