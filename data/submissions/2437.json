Whatever its form, it may present a potentially serious threat to Company operations, and to the health and safety of employees and the community.  Some emergencies - for example, chemical releases - are governed by strict federal, state and local laws.  Therefore, it is essential for all employees to be aware of potential emergency situations, to plan for them, and to take prompt and effective response should an emergency event actually occur.\n\nThe purpose of these procedures are to provide information and to establish guidelines in preparing for and response to emergencies.  The procedures include reporting requirements, emergency communication, evacuation plans, and other vital information needed to put response plans into action.\n\nThe procedures are divided into sections so that quick reference and action are facilitated.  All employees are expected to be familiar with these procedures and to review them routinely. {source EMG. PROCED. Section 1, page 1}\n\nThe Janesville plant is committed to safety.  The plant has developed site emergency response procedures and actively participates in the Rock County District Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Site officials work closely with the local fire department and safety and environmental consultants.  Air and water monitoring are performed regularly to ensure compliance with all permits and regulations. {source EMG. PROCED. Section 1, page 2}\n\nThe facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nABITEC Corporation's Janesville production facility is a 7 acre site located at 1530 S. Jackson Street in Janesville, WI.  Chemical operations began at the site in 1962 with a major expansion (doubling capacity) in 1980.\n\nThe facility manufactures surface active agents (surfactants).  The principle products manufactured are food grade, Kosher certified specialty oils; and fabric softener bases"

The latter are used by formulators of dryer and rinse-cycle fabric softeners, detergents, lubricants and personal care products.\n\nThe Risk Management Program applies to this facility because ethylene oxide and propylene oxide may be on-site in excess of 10,000 pounds at any one time.\n\nWorst case release scenario(s) alternative release scenario(s):\n\nThe worst case senario is defined by the regulation as \"..the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to endpoint defined in Sec. 68.22(a).\"\n\nOur worst case scenario was determined using EPS's \"RMP OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS GUIDANCE\" dated May 24,1996.\n\nThe scenario, as required, describes the release of 180,000 pounds (a full railroad car) of ethylene oxide.\n\nThe radius of the off site consequence, using the above referenced method, is 9.9 miles.  The center of this circle is our facility at N 42.659 W 89.020 (using MARPLOT map).  The estimated population within this circle is 93,169 (using 1990 census data available at www.census.gov).\n\nThe above mentioned populations includes residential and business areas, schools, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, a correctional institution, and numerous parks, golf courses and other recreational facilities.\n\nAn alternative release of two hundred (200) pounds of ethylene oxide was considered.  Although this is a larger release than anything we have experienced in the last five years, we are aware of such a release at a facility practicing similar operations.  The radius of the off site consequences is sixty (60) yards with the only public receptor being a rail road siding.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is required to comply with the OHSA PSM rule.  We therefore have written operating procedures, etc."

We have conducted emergency procedures drills which emphasize operation shutdown, personnel accounting, evacuation and reporting to local, state and federal authorities\n\nFor large scale releases we depend upon 911 response from the local fire department (response time estimated as fifteen minutes).\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nInstallation of water cannons (3) for fire supression at the rail car siding and the tank farm areas.\n\nThere are plans to install diking for the ethylene oxide railcar.\n\nA fire surpression sprinkler system is to be installed over the intermediate storage tanks (day tanks).\n\nAwarning was generate after completing this submission regarding 1.12.c Clean Air Act Operating Permit.  We have submitted our application to the Wisconsin DNR (dated 4/3/95) but have not received a newer permit number to replace our previously assigned number of MIA-05-80-54-140.\n\nAlthough there is presently a low level shut off for the fluid barrier for the double mechanical seals of the centrifugal EO/PO pumps, we intend to place alarms on these level sensors."
