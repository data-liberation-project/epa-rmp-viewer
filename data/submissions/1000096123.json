The plant has purged and flushed all process and distribution pipelines, along with the sphere where Vinylidene Chloride was stored. All associated equipment was opened to atmosphere on October 16th, 2021.\r\n\r\nRemoved Chlorine from Building 1 since the plant does not use this chemical anymore. The plant has blown out the pipeline within their block limits and installed a blind flange to the site header for Chlorine on August 30th, 2021. Due to the removal of this chemical, Building 1 is no longer subject to RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nAddition of New Process/Program:\r\nAdded the 1200 building as a new process in the site plan, since this is a new production plant in the construction phase that will have 30% ammonium hydroxide above the threshold of 20,000 lbs in their block limits. \r\n\r\nDecreased Total Volume of Regulated Substance:\r\nRemoved 870,000 lbs of Chlorine from the site plan, due to the decommissioning of some distribution pipelines based on different production plants not using Chlorine anymore. These distribution pipelines were purged and then opened to atmosphere. \r\n\r\nIncrease Total Volume of Regulated Substance:\r\nDoubled the maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide to 48,000 lbs for the 827 plant, as the plant is increasing the number of raw material cylinders that will be stored in their block limits to prevent down time with shortages and shipping issues.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nCorteva Agriscience, LLC Midland Operations is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.

There are four (4) covered processes, five (5) programs and six (6) regulated substances present at the stationary source.  \r\nThe regulated substances are listed below.  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances:\r\n\r\nAmmonia (anhydrous)\r\nAmmonia (>20% Concentration as Ammonium Hydroxide)\r\nChlorine\r\nCrotonaldehyde [2-butenal]\r\nDimethylamine\r\nSulfur dioxide\r\n\r\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection\r\n\r\nThere was one (1) worst case toxic and one (1) worst case flammable scenario reported in this submittal. There are six (6) total alternate cases reported, one of which is a flammable case.  Most of the toxic alternate cases were reported due to that being the only alternate case for the chemical.  No toxic alternate cases for chlorine impacted a population, so the scenario reported for chlorine was the only alternate case that reached an endpoint off-site. The flammable alternate case reported in the previous submission is no longer applicable, since the 941 plant doesn't have Vinylidene Chloride anymore, therefore a different scenario needed to be reported. The new flammable alternate case scenario reported is a Dimethylamine release from the 489 plant since this is the only regulated RMP chemical that the site"
