Management continues to do all it can to protect the Health and Safety of all staff and to provide a safe working environment. However, safety requires the participation of everyone...only you can make safety a reality. Be alert for conditions which appear unsafe. Report unsafe conditions immediately.

A Description of the Savannah, GA Facility and Regulated Substances Handled.\nThe Savannah, GA facility is located at 5565 Export Blvd., Garden City, GA 31408. The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of prepackaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving, and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. Toxic and flammable regulated substances are stored at the Savannah, GA warehouse which include the RMP regulated substances boron trifluoride, dichlorosilane, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), epichlorohydrin, ethylenediamine, and vinyl acetate monomer.\nRinchem receives  boron trifluoride, dichlorosilane, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), epichlorohydrin, ethylenediamine, and vinyl acetate monomer by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. It is unloaded from the truck using a forklift and staged for inspection. After the product passes an initial quality and safety inspection, it is received and tracked in an electronic inventory management system. The hazard class"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention \nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in\n\"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\". The safeguards taken include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of boron trifluoride, dichlorosilane, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), epichlorohydrin, ethylenediamine, or vinyl acetate monomer.\n\n1.4. The Five Year Accident History\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving boron trifluoride, dichlorosilane, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), epichlorohydrin, ethylenediamine, and vinyl acetate monomer or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company LLC, Savannah, GA warehouse.\n\n1.5. The Emergency Response Program\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, LLC, Savannah, GA warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of boron trifluoride, dichlorosilane, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), epichlorohydrin, ethylenediamine, or vinyl acetate monomer from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above mentioned material.

The Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to notify emergency responders to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters, and other emergencies that may arise. The Emergency Action Plan and related notification documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to content and structure of the plan.\nNotification exercises:\nIn response to the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68.96(a), Rinchem has developed procedures to conduct an exercise of the stationary source's emergency response notification mechanisms. As all Rinchem Company, LLC facilities are non-responding stationary sources, Rinchem management and EHS recognize the importance of communication to emergency\nresponse organizations of the hazards that are present at Rinchem facilities. Rinchem has, and will continue to send community outreach letters to emergency response organizations (LEPC, Fire and Police) and invite these organizations to tour our stationary sources and participate in accidental release drills.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe facility evaluates, resolves, and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews, audits, process hazard analyses, and incident\ninvestigations. Changes may be made to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.
