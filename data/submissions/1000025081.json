      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Mansfield WWTP uses chlorine as required by federal and state regulations to reduce the risk of diseases. Chlorine is an effective destroyer of pathogens in water. Our employees and their families live here and we are all dedicated to the safe operation of our facility.\r\nPolicy: Safety of employees and the public are of primary concern. As a part of the public service sector, we are committed to protecting the public and the environment. Our programs include an aggressive preventative maintenance program, extensive training and coordination with local emergency response personnel to efficiently react to an emergency.\r\nDescription of the Facility: We treat the wastewater for our area. Part of the process requires insuring that disease-causing pathogens do not cause outbreaks of illnesses in the public. Chlorine is used to kill bacteria and other pathogens in our process.\r\nOffsite Consequence Analyses of a Release: In accordance with the EPA rules, an analysis of the impact distance in the case of a release of all chlorine connected to this system was performed. This analysis was made using EPA methods and guidance currently available. Stored chlorine not connected to the system and determined to not be at reasonable risk was not included. Our chlorine system includes automatic alarms and we have procedures in place to respond to emergency situations. We also have a very special system called a chlorine scrubber. In the event of a chlorine leak, this system is designed to collect all of the chlorine gas from a full cylinder within our chlorine room and neutralize it so that our employees and the public are protected.\r\nThe worst case model includes a release of one entire chlorine cylinder outside the storage room where the scrubber would not contain the release. The model predicts the area, which could be affected by the concentration of gas, which is considered immediately dangerous to life and health. A circle generated ignores wind directio"

      "SummaryText": "n. This circle is 1.3 miles in diameter. An alternate release scenario was also modeled which models a more realistic situation. We assumed that the tubing from one chlorine tanks breaks on a full chlorine tank within the chlorine storage room. Although the scrubber is designed to contain the chlorine from such a release, we modeled this scenario assuming the scrubber was only 50% effective. This model gave a diameter of potential impact of less than 0.1 miles.\r\nThere are strict licensing requirements to be a plant operator. In addition to our on-site training and safety procedures, the EPA and OSHA rules regulate our activities. As part of the requirements of this EPA program, we carefully reviewed our accident history for the last five years and we found that we have operated without a reportable chlorine related incident. We are dedicated to safety and our record proves it.\r\nIn case of an emergency, our personnel will work with local fire department responders and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. We have training every year for our people and we coordinate with the fire department on a regular basis. Although we take extensive precautions to prevent a chlorine release, we firmly believe in having a plan in case of an emergency. This is the same philosophy, which leads to fire drills and first aid training.\r\nWe are constantly looking for methods to improve. As part of this RMP program, we have reevaluated all of the plant chlorine processes and safety systems with the assistance of a professional engineer. A process hazard analyses and compliance audit have helped us to identify areas of possible improvement and they are being addressed."
