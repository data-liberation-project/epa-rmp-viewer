Husker Ag is expanding its capacity to produce 60 million gallons per year.  Since the beginning there have been constant review and revisions to reports and information.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nHusker Ag, LLC. has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nHusker Ag, LLC.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel are trained to activate remote shutoff valves and to follow the emergency response plan.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nHusker Ag, LLC. ethanol plant is located in Plainview, Pierce County, Nebraska\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia. Husker Ag, LLC. has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 4.9 miles; due to amount of ammonia stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 75,600 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 4.9 miles from the center of the plant.  Rural  residence homes are located within this 4.9 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Husker Ag, LLC. has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitiga"
