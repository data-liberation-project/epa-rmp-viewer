The subject facility covered by the Risk Management Plan is located at 2650 South Chase Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThe subject facility encompasses approximately 137,513 square feet which is divided internally into the following areas: hallways, shipping and receiving docks, fresh sausage kitchen, holding coolers, freezer, packaging, fresh sausage cooler, dry storage room, smoking and cooking room, stuffing department, smoke kitchen and raw meat cooler.\n\nKSC has adopted this Risk Management Program in order to implement the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act Amendments.  This Risk Management Program is required under 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68-Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, because KSC uses more than 10,000 pounds (lbs) of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) which is the threshold quantity.  The Risk Management Program will identify the process, the worst case and alternate scenarios, five-year accident history, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permit and contractors  to enable all those who may be affected to be able to identify and understand the hazards posed by the processes that involve NH3.\n\nThe Risk Management Program will be regularly reviewed and updated whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks and procedures.\n\nIn conjunction with the PHA, KSC completed a compilation of written process safety information in order to enable KSC supervisory personnel and KSC employees who operate the equipment which affects the refrigeration system to identify and understand the hazards posed by NH3.

      "SummaryText": "as well as oil, chemicals and coolants were included.\n\nNH3 is the chemical formula for ammonia which exists as a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.  NH3 is considered to be a nonflammable gas by the Department of Transportation and consists of 99.5 percent (%) of grade C (industrial grade) anhydrous ammonia, 0.4 % water and 0.1 % oil.  NH3 has, for most people, a noticeable odor at 20 parts per million (ppm).  NH3 is moderately irritating to the nose at approximately 100 ppm and causes major throat irritation at approximately 400 ppm.\n\nAmmonia gas can be compressed into a liquid.  Liquid ammonia is a corrosive material which causes burns and is harmful if swallowed.   NH3 is reactive with the halogens (chlorine and bromine).  NH3 is also reactive with heavy metals and their salts (silver, mercury and gold) to produce shock sensitive materials which when dry tend to explode.\n\nNH3 is thermally stable as a gas and as a liquid.  However, when not confined, the NH3 will evaporate.  NH3 is reactive with many organic materials including acids, acid chlorides, halogens, acid anhydrides, oxidizing agents, chloroformates, galvanized iron, zinc, copper and tin and their alloys and, therefore, is not a stable material when in contact with other substances.  Ammonia is most stable when confined in steel containers.\n \nThe chemistry of NH3 in KSC\u00bfs refrigeration system is a conversion of liquid ammonia to gaseous ammonia and back to liquid ammonia.  Liquid NH3 is pumped through the system, the NH3 evaporates as it absorbs heat and cools the evaporator element, is converted back to a liquid by compression through the desuperheater and condenser, and is pumped into the high temperature receiver to repeat the process.\n\nThe maximum inventory in the system is approximately 12,100 lbs of NH3.  The steel tank in the equipment room is designed to contain approximately 7,800 lbs of NH3 at 90% capacity.  The refrigeration system (tank and piping) can contain more ammonia; ho"

At least one member of the team is knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology being used.  The team also includes at least one employee who has experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated.\n\nKSC has developed and implemented written operating procedures for the tasks that KSC personnel perform (compressor service oil change, drain oil traps, switch liquid pumps, service cooling tower screens and nozzles, add oil to compressors and liquid pumps, add chemicals to cooling tower and clean purger).  Contractors which perform other maintenance and repair activities will familiarize themselves with KSC\u00bfs system and prepare operating procedures for their activities.  KSC\u00bfs procedures do, and their contractor\u00bfs operating procedures will, provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.

Those procedures will not, however, cover replacements in kind.\u00bf\n\nWritten procedures to manage changes to the process were developed and will be adhered to.

Large releases will be addressed by the Milwaukee County Sheriff\u00bfs Emergency Division.\n\nThe Risk Management Program is designed to be a written statement of overall company process safety management and risk management rules and policies.  There are a number of additional work rules, procedures, requirements, documents, reports, and separate programs that apply in particular situations or that are required by particular laws or regulations (for example:  hazard communication/right-to-know).
