This objective will never be compromised and is the most basic obligation of all personnel at the plant. In fulfilling this commitment, we ensure that all Corporate Environmental, Health and Safety Policies and Principles are strictly followed. \r\n\r\nThe Kankakee site is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also an active member of the Kankakee County Local Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n \r\nThe plant's Emergency Response Plan is based upon a combination of governmental and company requirements. Local response capabilities have been reviewed to ensure a coordinated response with all appropriate agencies. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire and police departments, governmental agencies, as well as any potentially affected neighbors.\r\n \r\nKankakee Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:\r\n \r\nA\u00b7 The primary purpose of the Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant is to produce emulsions for paper coating and painting industry.

The finished product leaving the plant contains very low concentrations of this chemical, such that they no longer present a toxicity hazard.\r\nB\u00b7 Vinyl Acetate is transported to the plant in both railcar and truck, the primary source of supply being railcar. Once received in the plant, the Vinyl Acetate is transferred to an onsite 150,000 gallon above-ground  storage tank. The polymer manufacturing process has the necessary equipment for the safe unloading of railcars into the storage tank and transferring into the process vessels.\r\nC\u00b7 Sometimes the railcars are stored on site and remain for a short time period until the Vinyl Acetate is transferred to the onsite 150,000 gallon above-ground  storage tank mentioned above. The polymer manufacturing process inventory quantity is based on the number of railcars predicted to be stored on site at any one given time, (NOTE: The quantity stated is a predictive estimate and the actual rail car storage is normally less) and the maximum quantity of the storage tank process delivery system.  \r\nD. Access to the Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant is restricted to authorized employees, and authorized contractors.  All persons seeking to enter the plant are screened and required to undergo training in the plant safety rules prior to entry.\r\n   \r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n \r\nThe Rohm and Haas Kankakee Plant Program's comply with OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP Rules, as well as with all applicable governmental codes and regulations.  Included in the Kankakee Plant's accidental release prevention plans are  automated processes with level and flow measurement and control, minimum inventories of chemicals,  automatic emergency shut-off valves on process vessels, fixed foam system at the unloading area, redundant safety interlock systems, preventative maintenance programs, chemical detectors, remotely operated valves to isola"
