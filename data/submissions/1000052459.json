Once closed, there will be no future need for the propane-butane mixture currently used as a propellant for aerosol products. Other un-involved operations at this plant will continue. The aerosol filling operation is actively being outsourced to other businesses. Currently, we are only operating the aerosol line about 2 weeks per month. It was our initial goal to close the process by year-end 2015, but delays in outsourcing may extend that date to April 2016. We foresee no delays in meeting our goal of ceasing operation of the aerosol filling process by April 2016 if not earlier. The equipment associated with the aerosol filling process will be removed from service and sold, scrapped or re-purposed.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \n\nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 and Texas Railroad Commission LP-Gas Safety Rules. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local regulations for storage and use of these regulated substances.  For all incidents or situations requiring emergency response assistance, it is our policy to notify the City of Irving, TX Fire and Police Departments (911) for response to the emergency. We provide copies of our contingency plans to the local public safety departments and closest major hospital. \n\n\n\nFacility and the Regulated Substance Handled:  \n\nThis facility formulates and blends liquid and solid chemicals into maintenance and cleaning products for industry and other commercial and public institutions.  This facility is an industrial user of propane-butane mixture as a propellant for aerosol products.  This process consists of two 9,000-gallon propane-butane storage tanks with interconnecting piping, compressors, pumps and the associated aerosol filling, capping and packaging equipment.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Rel"
