The facility has coordinated with Local Emergency Personnel in event of accidental release and comply with CFR 1910.38. \nIf an accidental  release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Fremont County LEPC, and or any other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the envirnoment.\n\nFacility Information\n                                                                                                                 \nFarm Service Company, 109 Depot Street, Randolph, IA has 2 - 12,000 gallon tanks which are used for the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3).  The primary activity of our facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  The maximum quantitiy stored would be 299,250 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.                                \n\nWorse-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe worse case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantitiy released would be 52,250 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point is 1.2 miles.  Farm Service Company has excess flow valves, emergency shut-off valves and breakaway valves in place, required by th ANSI Standards and State Requirements.  These will help limit exposure in a release situation.                                                                                                                                                               \n\nThe alternate release scenario:  \n\nThe most likely potential incident, would be a release from a transfer hose failure.  Excess flow valves and remote manual shut-off valves are installed to stop the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 7200 pounds over a 2 minute period of t"
