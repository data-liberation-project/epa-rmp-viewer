It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the Still Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is Municipal Wastewater Treatment.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant to kill pathogens prior to discharge of treated water.\nSulfur Dioxide is used in the dechlorination process to remove residual chlorine from the treated water prior to discharge to the local creek.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine: 12,000 pounds\nSulfur Dioxide: 12,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nFailure of a ton container of  2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide; 10 minute release mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because the process is sheltered by a building.  Under worst case weather, sulfur dioxide could travel 1.85 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nRupture of a flexible connection due to corrosion or fatigue.  The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute, and an offsite distance of 0.31 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur.  However, the plant policy is to replace the flexible connections quarterly, four times more frequent than the manufacturer's recommendations.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nStill Creek WWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68. Still Creek WWTP has condu"

As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \nFive Year Accident History\nStill Creek WWTP has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following recommendations were made as a result of the Still Creek WWTP Risk Management Program. Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\n' We will apply high grade bright yellow paint on all chlorine pressure pipe to facilitate early leak detection\n' We will repair all leak detectors along with alarms and SCADA interlocks.  We will ensure maintenance and calibration of leak detectors as part of contract maintenance.\n' We will begin to specifically look for leaks during 2 hour inspections \n' We will develop log sheets / checklists, and use once per shift.  We will note problems in logbook, and these procedures will be formalize in our SOP\n' We will require each operator to be trained on the plant's  SOP.\n' We will endeavor to develop and implement a chlorine and sulfur dioxide supplier audit program.  For example, do they have emergency container repair kits? Do they maintain their equipment?  \n' We will formalize our Buddy System for hazardous substance work at the plant.  \n' We will train employees recurrently on B-kits and SCBAs.  We will show B-kit videos, & drill annually (with air packs).\n' We will perform maintenance on defective vacuum regulator heating units, and cease use of any space heaters to facilitate sulfur dioxide feed.\n' We will begin a preventive maintenance program on pressure relief valves, a"
