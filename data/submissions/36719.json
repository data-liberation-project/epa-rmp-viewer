The prevention program herein accurately reflects the respect the owner/operators here have for the dangers involved in handling the chemical in the covered process.  All concerned citizens are welcome to visit the facility and ask questions regarding the chemical, anhydrous ammonia, and the safety measures in place to assure its proper handling.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is a toxic gas, which has corrosive properties and it is an inhalation hazard.  In the event of a sudden, uncontrollable release, where the total contents of the storage tank is released, as described in the worst case scenario enclosed in this report, inhabitants of local residences could be harmed. The best weapon against such an event occurring is planning and proper handling and maintenance of equipment.  The weapon of choice for battling a sudden release is dilution and neutralization with water. A more likely event would be one as described in the alternative release scenario, where a hose ruptures.  Shutting down the valve is the first action that would be taken in that event. Those in the immediate area may be affected.\n\nIn the event of an emergency where a spill could not easily be contained by the operator on site, the Cleveland County Sheriff\u00bfs Department and local fire officials will respond. \n\nMowdy Farms is a small, family owned operation located outside of town proper in Lexington, Oklahoma, and serves as the local supplier for anhydrous ammonia for local farming facilities.  In addition, the company offers custom application of the fertilizer for the local farmer who asks them to do so, as they have handled the chemical for several years.  The Mowdys have distributed anhydrous ammonia commercially for five years, and the facility was inspected by The Dept of Agriculture in January of 2003.  There have been no reportab"
