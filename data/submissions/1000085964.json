Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\n\n\nAt Don's Cold Storage, we utilize anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Don's strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets-both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Rogers Fire Department and the Benton County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 28,752 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to limit the Distances for each reported Scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be failure of"

The only time the receiver would be this full would be during a pump-down of the system, which only occurs during a construction project or certain maintenance projects and the procedure is strictly monitored.\n\nDistance to endpoint: 1.5 miles\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure relief valve.  The emergency valves shutdown release would engage and stop the flow and sounds an alarm.  The monitoring system would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 120 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 7200 pounds of Ammonia.\n\nDistance to endpoint: 0.1 miles (or 283 yards)\n\n\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\nThis is a newly constructed facility that opened in Spring of 2007.  To date, Don's Cold Storage facility has not incurred a reportable release.\n\n\n\n5.  The RMP Management Program.\n\n\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by the Maintenance Manager. He/She will administrate in conjunction with the Don's Cold Storage management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated to include the Benton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Rogers Fire Department.\n\n\n\n6.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\n\n\n\nDon's Cold Storage facility complies with all applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training, and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom and On-The-Job training.  They are given oral tests and are observed and able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledg"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Don's trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.
