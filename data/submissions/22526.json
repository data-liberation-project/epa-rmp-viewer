      "SummaryText": "Pastridor USA LLC is a manufacturer of breads currently in the process of constructing a new facility in the Vineland Industrial Park adjacent to New Jersey Route 55 at Exit 35, on the North side of Vineland, N.J.  The only chemical of concrn for off-site consequences is ammonia.  The ammonia, in both liquid and gaseous form will be in the freezer/refrigeration system.  It is the policy of Pastridor USA to construct, operate and maintain the refrigeration system in the safest possible manner.\n\nThis facility is similar to three other Pastridor facilities in Europe.  The safety record is excellent, and the best of European and American practices have been applied to ensure the safety of the Vineland system.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119), Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJAC 7:31) Regulations this facility has prepared a Process Safety Management Program, as well as performing air dispersion modeling and off-site consequences analysis.\n\nRecognizing the limitations imposed by low staffing levels at a highly automated facility, Pastridore has adopted a three level response system, based on the rate of release.  The three levels are Maintenance, Moderate and Major.  The maintenance staff will function in a proactive manner to prevent releases, but react to control and end larger accidental releases in a manner consistant with their training and equipment.\n\nAll employees will be trained in the hazards of ammonia and their actions in the unlikely event of a release.  Personnel not having maintenance functions will be internally evacuated to a \"safe haven\" within the building until the situation is declared safe.  In the event of an accidental release to the outside of the building all staff will remain inside.  The maintenance personnel will act to determine the source of the release and take appropriate safe action.\n\nPastridor USA LLC is not "

The on-site maintenance staff will perform such actions as can be safely performed within their training.  Off-site Emergency Management will be notified at the earliest possible time.  This will include an emergency maintenance contractor and  regulatory agencies.\n\nThe philosophy of Pastridor USA LLC is prevention, not response.  The personnel of Pastridor will be trained to operate and maintain the refrigeration system in the safest possible manner."
