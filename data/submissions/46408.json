A tabular summary of the release scenario data and results is presented at the end of this section.\r\nWorst-Case Scenario\r\nThe worst-case release scenario defined by the RMP regulations (19 CCR 2750.3) for ammonia used in this process is as follows:  For regulated toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe (whichever is greater) is released as a gas over 10 minutes.

The worst-case release rate would therefore be approximately 1,500 pounds of ammonia per minute.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario. Since the vessel is located outdoors (i.e., mounted on the roof), no mitigation measures were considered.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario would be 0.7 mile.\r\nAlternative Scenario\r\nPursuant to RMP regulations, the alternative release scenario was identified as that which is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario, and that which will reach an endpoint offsite.  The alternative release scenario used meteorological conditions more representative of the site than those used for the worst-case scenario.  The alternative release scenario was derived from the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study conducted at Fresh Express in December 2004.  \r\nThe scenario chosen is a failed pressure relief valve resulting from overpressurization of the high pressure receiver.  The 3/4 pressure relief valve is rated at 250 psig.  Since the vessel is located outdoors (i.e., mounted on the roof), no mitigation measures were considered.  Based on the calculated release rate of 1417 pounds of ammonia per minute and assuming that the entire system charge is released, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative release scenario would be 0.4 mile.\r\nRelease Scenario Map\r\nThe figure presented at the end of this section depicts the above release scenarios, plotted on a map of the area generated by LandView(r) 6 desktop mapping program.\r\nOffsite Impacts\r\nAs required by the RMP regulations, the populations that fall within the circles defined by the distance to toxic endpoints for both the worst-case and alternat"

Using the population estimator within the LandView(6 program, it was determined by the Block Group Proration method that approximately 2,928 people reside within the 0.7-mile radius of the worst-case release scenario, and approximately 933 people reside within the 0.4-mile radius of the alternative release scenario.

Based on review of the LandView(6 program data, there are two heliports and one airport within the 0.7-mile radius of the worst-case release scenario. \r\nEnvironmental Receptors\r\nEnvironmental receptors that must be noted in the RMP are natural areas, such as national or state parks, forests or monuments; wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges or areas; and Federal wilderness areas.

The facility receives produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, transported and distributed from the site.\r\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is estimated at 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Since the amount of ammonia in the system exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds, the process that uses the ammonia is covered by the RMP requirements.\r\nRelease Scenarios1\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nIn this worst-case release scenario, the total ammonia refrigeration system charge of approximately 15,000 pounds is assumed to be released within 10 minutes from the high-pressure receiver resulting from a breach of containment.  The worst-case release rate would therefore be approximately 1,500 pounds of ammonia per minute.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario. Since the vessel is located outdoors (i.e., mounted on the roof), no mitigation measures were considered.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario would be 0.7 mile.  \r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nThe alternative release scenario was derived from the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study conducted at Fresh Express in December 2004.  The scenario chosen is a failed pressure relief valve resulting from overpressurization of the high pressure receiver.  Since the vessel is located outdoors (i.e., mounted on the roof), no mitigation measures were considered.  Based on the calculated release rate of 1417 pounds of ammonia per minute and assuming that the entire system charge is released, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative release scenario would be 0.4 mile.\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Ste"

The Safety Manager for the Fresh Express Grand Prairie site ensures that safe practices are followed in operations involving hazardous materials. This site has established emergency procedures and coordinates with the local Fire Department and a local Emergency Response Team (to be contracted) to ensure rapid and appropriate response to hazardous material emergencies, which include response to emergencies related to the ammonia refrigeration system covered by this RMP.  The site has written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Fresh Express facility covered by this RMP is located at 2370 W.

The worst-case release rate would therefore be approximately 1,500 pounds of ammonia per minute.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario. Since the vessel is located outdoors (i.e., mounted on the roof), no mitigation measures were considered.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario would be 0.7 mile.  \nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario was derived from the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study conducted at Fresh Express in December 2004.  The scenario chosen is a failed pressure relief valve resulting from overpressurization of the high pressure receiver.  Since the vessel is located outdoors (i.e., mounted on the roof), no mitigation measures were considered.  Based on the calculated release rate of 1417 pounds of ammonia per minute and assuming that the entire system charge is released, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for this alternative release scenario would be 0.4 mile.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications prior to their occurrence, and the regular operation, maintenance and monitoring of the system.  This includes:\n* Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction of the system, as well as in the event of system modifications through a management of change process.\n* Performance of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) at least once every five years using accurate process safety information.\n* Implementation of operating, maintenance and monitoring procedures. \n* Training of system operations and mainten"

A tabular summary of the release scenario data and results is presented at the end of this section.\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario defined by the RMP regulations (19 CCR 2750.3) for ammonia used in this process is as follows:  For regulated toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe (whichever is greater) is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  In this worst-case scenario, the total system charge is assumed to be released within 10 minutes from the high-pressure receiver resulting from a breach of containment, based on the system design.  \nFresh Express has determined that the current total system charge is approximately 15,000 pounds.  The worst-case release rate would therefore be approximately 1,500 pounds of ammonia per minute.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario. Since the vessel is located outdoors (i.e., mounted on the roof), no mitigation measures were considered.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario would be 0.7 mile.\nAlternative Scenario\nPursuant to RMP regulations, the alternative release scenario was identified as that which is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario, and that which will reach an endpoint offsite.  The alternative release scenario used meteorological conditions more representative of the site than those used for the worst-case scenario.
