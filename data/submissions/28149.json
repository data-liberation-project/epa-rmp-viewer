This determination is based upon federal and state process safety and process management (PS/PM) regulations and Santee Cooper CCG?s standards.  This process (receipt, storage, and conveyance) is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three program levels (1, 2, & 3) of requirements.  Program Level 1 is applicable to a process for which it can be demonstrated that no public receptors (e.g., residence, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals) would be affected by a worst-case release.  A covered process is subject to Program 2 requirements if it does not meet the eligibility requirements of either Program 1 & 3.  Therefore, Santee Cooper worse case scenario identifies public receptors would be affected.  40 CFR Part 68 identifies that the processes, at the Santee Cooper CGS facility, as subject to Program 3 requirements.  The Santee Cooper Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this facility under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site via either railcar or tanker truck and is stored in a series of six (6) above ground storage tanks (each with a nominal capacity of 30,000 gallons, and actual maximum design capacity of 25,500 gallons).  Santee Cooper CGS administratively limits the amount of ammonia delivered via railcar to 29,485 gallons per shipment.  Therefore, this volume is the largest amount that is contained in a single vessel at any one time.  The total storage capacity of all ammonia stored at the facility is 102,000 gallons, or 582,000 pounds."
