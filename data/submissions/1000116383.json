      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\nThe SEA3 Providence facility was originally designed and constructed by Chicago Bridge & Iron Company and is a refrigerated LPG storage facility protected from overpressure by vacuum relief valves.  The original facility design was based on American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 2510 \u0096 Design and Construction of LPG Installations and the storage vessel design was based on API 620 - Design and Construction of Large, Welded, Low-Pressure Storage Tanks.  The AST is a double walled insulated tank designed for an internal pressure of 1.5 psig at a nominal temperature of -50 Fahrenheit (F) and is insulated with 21-inches of loose fill perlite insulation and 3-inches of fiberglass insulation.   The original tank foundation design was undertaken by Haley & Aldrich, Inc. consulting engineers.   Anchor bars embedded in the concrete foundation are provided to transmit the tank uplift loads to the foundation. The bars are not welded to the tank and are attached by means of a bracket which will allow for take-up of any slack or settlement which might occur during the initial hydrostatic testing of the tank. The roof of the tank is insulated with blown in mineral wool or perlite insulation.   The tank shell plates were designed for the internal pressure plus the static head due to the weight of the LPG product. One-quarter-inch (1/4\u0094) thick bottom segmental plates, butt welded from both sides are used immediately beneath the tank shell.   The double walled tank has an outer steel vapor barrier. This includes a double bottom arrangement wherein the load bearing insulation is installed between the two bottoms. \n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSea-3 has conducted an extensive recommissioning project that improved the terminals safety, equipment and policies and procedures to meet our standards and those of the EPA, OSHA, US Coast Guard as well as local and State of Rhode Island requirements.

Our commitment is demonstrated by the improved design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at Providence Terminal.  It is Sea-3's policy to implement appropriate controls to eliminate or prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, our response activities are coordinated with Rhode Island Hazardous Material Planning District 5.  Our prevention program and response will help minimize the release and its impacts.  \n\n2.  Stationary Source & Regulated Substances Handled: \n\nOur terminal's primary activity is the receipt, storage, and shipment of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  There are two (2) regulated substances held at above both EPA and OSHA threshold quantities are present at our terminal.  These substances are propane and ethyl mercaptan (ethane thiol).  Both are listed as flammable.  Propane is a gas and ethyl mercaptan is a liquid.  Propane is received as a refrigerated liquid by marine vessels, stored on-site and transformed to a liquid under pressure.  It is loaded in to trucks for distribution in the Providence area and other nearby states.  Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane delivered to trucks for safety purposes.  Both compounds are classified as flammable under 40 CFR Part 68.  No compounds classified as toxic are stored or used at the terminal in amounts above their threshold quantities.  Details on the amount of flammable materials stored on the terminal site are contained in the RMP data elements.  \n\n3.  Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involve a catastrophic release from storage tanks.  The scenario involves the release of the contents of the large refrigerated propane storage tank, which contains the largest single quantity of flammable material at the terminal.

The alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from Storage and Transfer.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  This scenario is based on the rupture of a 3-inch truck loading line and assumes that active measures (hydrocarbon detectors and automatic shut-off devices) stop the flow within 20-seconds.  The maximum amount of propane vented is assumed to be involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  Details on the alternate case scenario are contained in the RMP registration data elements.  \n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program & the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \n\nThe Sea-3 terminal has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR Part 1910-119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that was revised, implemented and are currently in place at the Providence, RI terminal.  \n\n4.1  Process Safety Information:\n\nSea-3 maintains a record or Process Safety Information  (PSI) that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all applicable processes.    \n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur terminal conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The HAZOP methodology is primarily used to carry out these analyses.  Hazard analysis revalidations are conducted to review the previous hazard analysis and to review modifications made to the terminal since the last hazard analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified, trained personnel with expertise in: engineering, process operations.   The last PHA revalidation was completed on February 14, 2024.      \n\n4.3  Operating Procedures:\n\nThe operating procedures (OPs)"
