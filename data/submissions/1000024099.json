A detailed Consolidated Contingency Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\r\n\r\n2.\tFACILITY INFORMATION\r\n\u00bf\tThe Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in the Sacramento Delta Area of Northern California.\r\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. Regulated pesticides will be received, stored, and distributed for direct application in pest control.\r\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 15,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 65,900 pounds.\r\n\u00bf\tAqua ammonia is received by truck and stored in two 20,500-gallon, above-ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is \r\n249,700 pounds.    \r\n\r\n3.\tTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \r\nThe worst-case release scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 65,900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia; this represents the volume of the largest storage tank limited at 85% of ca"

The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe with an increased wind speed and D stability modeling parameters. \r\nb.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \r\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 124,850 pounds of aqua ammonia within a secondary containment structure.  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a pipe break modeled with an increased wind speed and D Stability modeling parameters. \r\n\r\n4.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\r\nSafety Information:  Lyman ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.  The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on September 30, 2011.\r\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the ammonia and pesticide processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on February 24, 2010.  Results indicate that no high risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\r\nOperating Procedures:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed.  The operating procedures were last revised in September 30, 2011.  Operating procedures for the Anhydrous Ammonia Process are certified annually, with the last annual certification on September 30, 2011.\r\nTraining:  The Facility staff, as well as TLG corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff.  A training program, whi"

The current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n\u00bf\tInitial employee training;\r\n\u00bf\tPeriodic refresher training;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\r\n\u00bf\tCompetency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\r\n\u00bf\tTraining records for each employee.\r\nMaintenance:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.  The latest equipment inspections were conducted on \r\nFebruary 7, 2011, and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on October 3, 2011.\r\nRMP Change Management:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health.  The Facility RMP Change Management (RMPCM) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures.\r\nPre-startup Review:  The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated.  Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup safety review.  This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the RMPCM review.  Additionally, a pre-startup safety review is performed in conjunction with the RMPCM review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures.  \r\nCompliance Audits:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written p"

The most recent compliance audit was conducted in February 2010. \r\nIncident Investigation:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place.  The program includes investigation requirements and reporting and would be implemented in the event of an incident.\r\nEmployee Participation:  The Facility must rely upon the operational expertise and training of its employees at all levels and disciplines to ensure safe operations.  The Facility has implemented procedures regarding employee participation to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program.\r\nHot Work Permit:  Hot work does not typically occur on or near the Anhydrous Ammonia Process.  However, should hot work be required, Lyman has developed a written Hot Work Permit to document the evaluation of the fire prevention and protection requirements.\r\nContractor Safety:  The contractors used by the Facility for anhydrous ammonia delivery have been informed regarding the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to delivery of anhydrous ammonia to the Walnut Grove Facility.  The Facility has confirmed that the delivery contractors have provided the appropriate training to their drivers regarding the delivery of anhydrous ammonia.  \r\nIn addition to the prevention program elements described above, the following chemical-specific prevention steps have been implemented.\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility implements the provisions of the Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders; and"
