This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.\n\nThe EPS is a gas fired combined cycle generating station that produces approximately 775 megawatts of electricity during peak demand periods  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accident Release Program (ARP), the EPS is a Program 3 process.\n\nThe EPS was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were or would be present in the planned process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  The three separate generating units and associated ammonia tanks are separate of each other.  Therefore, for ARP Program purposes, these processes were considered separately.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nCLECO Evangeline, L.L.C. identified one regulated toxic substance and no flammable substances above the threshold values at EPS.  Three bullet tanks with a capacity of 10,000 gallons each, containing anhydrous ammonia were determined to exceed the threshold quantity.  The identification of this exceedance indicates that the EPS is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe EPS has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nThe EPS has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required n 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PRO"

      "SummaryText": "GRAM\n\nCLECO Evangeline, L.L.C. and the EPS actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.  This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  \nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe EPS maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as for key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe EPS has a comprehensive pr"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The EPS uses the what if/checklist to perform this evaluation.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The EPS assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of targeted completion dates.  The plant also provides communication to operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates the revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe EPS maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as  initial startup,  normal operations,  temporary operations,  emergency shutdown,  emergency operations,  normal shutdown, and  startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the EPS has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and "

Operations demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe EPS issues a hot work permit as necessary for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  Procedures for issuing a hot work permit are clearly outlined in the CLECO Evangeline Safety Manual.  The EPS provides Hot Work Permit training to applicaple plant employees.  Copies of issued work permits are maintained in operations and Maintenance for a period of one-year following completion of work.\n\nContractors\n\nThe EPS periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors  are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, have received and understood the training  follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe EPS conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are approximately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed.  A standard checklist is used to document compliance.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe EPS has well-established programs, procedures and practi"

Process equipment inspection and testing follows recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Equipment deficiencies that are outside of acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to ensure safe operation.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe EPS has a system to manage and document changes to all covered processes.  A systematic approach is followed to control and manage facility changes in order to minimize the possibility that such changes will have an adverse impact on personnel safety, equipment, or the environment.  Employees involved in process operations and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks might be affected by process changes are informed of and trained in the change prior to process start-up.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe EPS promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The plan outlines actions that company technicians and contract employees are to take when there is an unwanted release of highly hazardous chemicals.  The intent of this plan is to facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary and to account for all personnel.  The emergency plan also includes procedures for handling small releases.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, the EPS periodically conductes an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices.  The audit team develops findings and corrective actions are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained."
