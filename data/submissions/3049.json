      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Program (RMP) was developed for the City of Brooklyn Parks WTP in an effort to fulfill criteria of the RMP, as required by Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), and regulated by 40 CFR, Part 68.  Brooklyn Parks WTP is a conventional water treatment plant utilizing filtration, sedimentation, and disinfection. The quantities of chlorine used at the water treatment plant is greater than the Threshold Quantity of 2,500 pounds, which is EPAs criteria for requiring the development and submittal of the information found in this RMP.  A hazard assessment was conducted for the chlorine process and consideration was also given to the other hazardous chemicals at the plant as well.\n\nt is this facilitys intent to uphold industry standards in the operation of the facility and  it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency was to occur, it is our policy and/or procedure to notify the Brooklyn Park Fire Department (via the 911 system) and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nChlorine is considered toxic by EPA standards.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a water treatment agent and fuel supply, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chemicals; combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe chlorine system at the WTP consists of one ton chlorine cylinders, scales, chlorinators, vacuum regulators, diffusers, injectors, residual analyzers, leak detectors and a chlorine emergency vapor scrubber system.  The chlorine cylinders, scales and vacuum regulators are located in Room 135.  Room 134 houses the chlorinators and the chlorine neutralization system is located in Room 211.  Chlorine is also stored and u"

Generally the facility has two cylinders in operation and two cylinders in waiting.  The WTP chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room are equipped with chlorine detectors.  These rooms are also connected to a sodium hydroxide emergency chlorine scrubber system.  The distribution/piping system is constructed of schedule 80 PVC piping and is operated under a negative pressure (vacuum). \n\nWorst-Case Scenario (WCS) Chlorine -- 2,000 lb. is the maximum quantity of chlorine  in a single storage vessel that can be released in a WCS.  For WCS, according to EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Facilities criteria, the distance to toxic endpoint for this WCS is 1.3 miles.  The facility is located in a populated, urban area with an estimated population of  13,656 persons living within the 1.3 mile radius (per Landview III software*).  No environmental receptors (as defined by 40 CFR Part 68) are located within this radius.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS) for chlorine --  the release chosen is a <\" diameter hole releases chlorine for 10 minutes from the process line in the chlorine storage room and the scrubber fails to activate. Passive mitigation is considered for the release occurring inside the building.  The distance to toxic endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 miles, which reaches residential housing and an estimated population of 18 within this distance (per Landview III software*).\n\n* This Landview III software was issued Dec. 1997 and utilized 1990 census data.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIt is this facilitys intent to comply with EPAs accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

Through evaluation, the consequences of catastrophic releases can be prevented or minimized.\n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the PSM and RMP standards, Brooklyn Park intends to prevent unwanted releases or minimize the impacts of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose employees, the community and environment to serious hazards.  Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n7 Process safety information: Technical information about how the process operates.\n7 Process hazard analysis: Technical analysis of the plants processes in order to anticipate what might go wrong and recommend approaches to minimize the possibility of such occurrences.\n7 Operating procedures: Technical and administrative procedures used to operate the plant safely.\n7 Training: Provide employees with information necessary to ensure safe operation.\n7 Mechanical integrity: Ensures proper maintenance of the process on an ongoing basis.\n7 Management of change: Analyze and understand the impact of changes in equipment, procedures and personnel.\n7 Pre-startup review: Ensure all necessary elements for operating a safe process are in place prior to introducing the hazardous chemical into a \"new\" system.\n7 Compliance audits: Periodic evaluation and updating of the RMP to ensure the continued safe operation of the covered process.\n7 Incident investigation: Procedures for investigating the cause of an accident and developing measures to prevent future similar occurrences.\n7 Employee participation:  Philosophy and approach to incorporating the knowledge and experience of all facets of operation regarding the covered process.\n7 Hot work permit:  Documented program for controlling the hazards associated with"

Brooklyn Park has also developed a risk management system which identifies job positions and responsibilities to ensure proper management of the RMP.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine or other toxic/extremely hazardous chemicals in the past 5 years which have resulted in injury, death, offsite consequences, response or restoration activities.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe have discussed the content and intent of this program with the Brooklyn Park Fire Department.
