Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with CALVERT CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facilities primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), and Formaldehyde.  The regulated substances at our facility are received prepackaged in different  containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide and Formaldehyde are used only for resell to our customers.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 49,250 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Formaldehyde are present at our facility in quantities of 21,000 lbs., and 54,000 lbs.  respectively.\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Informatio"
