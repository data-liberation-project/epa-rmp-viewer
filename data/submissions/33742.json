The accidental release prevention policy at the Hampton Township\n\nSanitary Authority, Allison Park treatment facility involves a combined\n\neffort between management, operating and local emergency personnel.\n\nThe facility has an ongoing effort to identify hazards, review safety\n\ntechniques, and implement employee training through operation,\n\nmaintenance and inspection procedures to manage the risk of a chlorine\n\ngas release.\n\n\n\nB.    The Hampton Township Sanitary Authority?s, Allison Park treatment\n\nfacility was originally placed into operation in 1971.  The facility\n\nwas expanded both in 1986 and 1992.  The facility currently has the\n\ncapacity of treating 3.2 million gallons per day of wastewater.  Gaseous\n\nchlorine, which is stored in a separate room, is utilized to disinfect\n\nthe effluent prior to discharging to the receiving water.  The amount of\n\nchlorine handled is two one-ton containers for a total of 4,000 pounds.\n\nThe chlorine gas feeders are cylinder-mounted and are designed for\n\nconveying the gas under vacuum.  The chlorine system is inspected daily\n\nby the wastewater treatment plant operating personnel.  The facility is\n\nmanned approximately 8.5 hours per day.\n\n\n\nC.    In general, the Allison Park Treatment Facility?s accidental\n\nrelease prevention program is based on the following:\n\n\n\n    - Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\n\n    - Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\n\n    - Preparation of written operating procedures for safely\n\n      conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\n\n    - Implementation of employee training program\n\n    - Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques\n\n      and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\n\n\n\nAs an integral part of the prevention program, the Hampton Township\n\nSanitary Authority will perform a compliance audit at least once ev"

The compliance audit will include a review of all aspects of\n\nthe risk management program in conjunction with corrective actions if\n\nany deficiencies exist.  Written documentation of the audit will be\n\nmaintained on-site.\n\n\n\nAny incident that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic\n\nrelease of chlorine will be investigated immediately.  A summary of the\n\ninvestigation and corrective actions will be documented and maintained\n\nat the treatment facility.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific prevention measures include the facility having the\n\nappropriate safety equipment on-site including a chlorine detection\n\ndevice, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and a ton-cylinder repair\n\nkit.  The facility promotes training and educating the employees\n\nrelative to acceptable operating and handling techniques of\n\nchlorine gas.\n\n\n\nD.    There was one accidental release of chlorine at the facility in\n\nJune 2001 due to a bad valve.  The chlorine cylinder was almost empty\n\nwhen the leak occurrred, therefore, only approximately 75 pounds of\n\nchlorine was released. The correct agancies were notified of the leak\n\nand responded to the facility.  The chlorine had already dissipated by\n\nthe time the response team arrived at the facility.  There were no\n\ninjuries or harm to the environment due to the leak.\n\n\n\nE.    The facility is included under the Local Emergency Planning\n\nCommittee (LEPC) of Allegheny County?s written emergency response plan.\n\nRelease response procedures by all involved parties, evacuation\n\nprocedures, and training exercises are included within the plan.  The\n\npublic is to be notified by the County Emergency Management Agency as\n\nsoon as a release occurs.  Evacuation route has been mapped within the\n\nplan.  The plan is reviewed/updated annually by the facility\n\nemergency coordinator.\n\n\n\nThe Allison Park WPCP employees will not respond to accidental releases\n\nof chlorine gas.
