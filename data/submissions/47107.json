The facility is located at 209 Range Drive, Garland, Texas 75040.  The SIC code for the operation is 2013; the NAICS code is 311612.  The facility has approximately 280 full time employees.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, five days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh and preserve food safety standards.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe operating capacity of the system is approximately 48,500 pounds.  The system is a two-stage refrigeration cycle and is used to cool and freeze raw materials and prepared food products.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, in"

All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions stated in the facility's plan.\n\nThe system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation daily.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours apart.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with ammonia detectors that alarm and start local exhaust ventilation systems when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels in the engine room.  The system can be manually shutdown using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic drills.  \n\nThe facility experienced two minor ammonia releases in February 2005 that resulted in minor employee injury.  A pinhole leak occurred in an ammonia line in a penthouse located above a pack area in the building.  Ammonia gas was drawn into the room by the roof mounted make-up air unit located in the penthouse.  It is estimated that one pound or less ammonia was released during these events.  The first event occurred at approximately 1:15 pm on 2-25-05, lasting about ten minutes.  A repair was made to the unit at that t"

      "SummaryText": "ime.  A second leak occurred in the same unit at approximately 7:00 am on 2-26-05.  The unti was again repaired and returned to service.  This unit is scheduled for replacement.  Employees were evacuated from this area during both minor release events.  Air monitoring in the area indicated that ammonia concentrations were at or below 4 ppm each time.  The OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit for ammonia is 50 ppm (8 hr TWA).  Some employees experienced discomfort and were sent to the hospital for observation.  Six employees were sent for treatment on 2-25 and three were sent on 2-26.  These employees were treated and released the same day without restrictions.  No contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place occurred as a result of this release.  The facility has undertaken significant system improvement projects to prevent this type of incident form recurring. \n\nAdvance Food Company- Garland has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  A release of 100 pounds or more must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.  The Fire Department has been provided with a copy of the facility's emergency action plan."
