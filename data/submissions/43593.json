If an accidential release should occur the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and/or other authorities to midigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.  A detailed ER plan has been developed and will be implimented in the event of an accidental release.\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity of Big Valley Ag Services is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers. The regulated substance aqua ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nuttients.  All other products do not meet the minimum federal requirments for reporting purpose.  Aqua Ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in one 10,000 gallon above ground tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua amonia handled at our facility is 60,800 pounds.  \n3. Worst-Case Release:  Failure of the 10,000 gallon storage tank when full (80% for expansion allowance)which would release 60,800 pounds of of the aqua ammonia with a distance end point at .37 miles,(point of dispersion to 200ppm).\n4. Alternitive Release:  Failure of a 1,300 gallon nurse tank filled to 80% for expansion with a distance end point of .14 miles, (point of dispersion to 200ppm).\n5. Accidential Release Prevention Program:  The facility maintains provisions of the \"Safety Requirments for Storage and Handling of Anhyrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the ANSI., CCR Title 8 Subchapter 1, \" Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\", CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhyrous Ammonia\".\n6. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n7. Emergency Response:  This program is in accordance with the following regulations; CFR Title 29,1910.38; 1910.120; and Section 25503"
