Risk Management Program.\n\nArtesian Ice & Cold Storage Company, Inc. is a cold storage warehouse and produces ice for retail business.  Our facility is located at 2700 Stockyards Expressway in St. Joseph, Missouri.  Our operation utilizes ammonia (anhydrous) as a refrigerate.  We maintain a capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia on site at any given time.  We take great pride in our safety and awareness programs in the handling of ammonia.\n\nArtesian Ice & Cold Storage Company, Inc. has a fully trained Hazardous Materials Response Team on site to handle any accidental release of ammonia within the plant.  Our team consists of 5 Hazardous Materials Technicians (one taking the role of incident commander during a release).  The team attends annual refresher training as outlined in 1910.120 (e)(g) of 29 CFR, along with monthly training sessions on handling of accidental releases throughout the plant.\n\nArtesian Ice & Cold Storage Company, Inc., has daily walk through inspections of plant and automated alarm systems to monitor when a release has occured within the facility.\n\nIn the past five (5) years we have had two (2) small releases due to equipment failure.  These releases generated <100 pounds of ammonia being releases into the environment.  There were no offsite or onsite injuries.  These incidents occured in Septmeber of 1995 and June of 1996.  Both incidents were reported to all regulating agencies.\n\nOur worst case scenario for this facility would be the result of catastrophic incident from a major fire and explosion at the plant.  Thus, causing a vapor cloud that would dissipate quickly into the air.  Our response team will monitor the air for levels of ammonia gases and work with outside contracted firm to mitigate the release.  We have contracted services with Environmental Technology and Services of St. Joseph, Missouri for release beyond our capabilities in han"

This includes a complete site visit with Fire Service and local Emergeny Response Team.\n\nOur, Emergency Response Program consist of a five (5) member team:\nThe Emergecy Response Team (E.R.T.) consist of five (5) members with the Fire Department as our back up and safety team.\n\nIn the event of a leak the E.R.T. will meet at the Emergency Response Trailer.\n\nTwo team members will don level A suits with SCBA's.  A third member will have on a SCBA with level B suit.  The two memebers with level A suits will go in as the main team taking a rope with them to stay in contact with each other.  The team will check the ammonia level with a draw tube.  They will report their findings to the incident commander.  If the level of ammonia is low, the two man team can try to isolate or stop a spill or leak.  After the leak has been stopped the team will then be decontaminated by using a high velocity fan.\n\nArtesian Ice & Cold Storage Company, Inc., is always looking at new information and training available to reduce the risk of human health and the environment during a release of ammonia within our facility.  We take great pride in our safety and health programs and are always keeping updated on the new standards pertaining to the Referigeration Industry to improve safety for our plant and community."
