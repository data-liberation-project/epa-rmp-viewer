      "SummaryText": "1.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nAshland Specialty Ingredients, GP (ASI) currently owns and operates a guar manufacturing plant located at One Mill Street, Kenedy, Karnes County, Texas.  Plant processes include bulk storage of guar splits, alteration by chemical addition, and grinding.  This facility is an agricultural-based processing plant approximately 26.94 acres in area and began operation in October 1953.  Guar flour and its derivatives are produced at the plant.  Operations are scheduled 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.  Normal operations require approximately 65 employees, including office and production workers. \r\n\r\nPropylene oxide is delivered to the plant biweekly in tanker trucks and stored in a bulk storage tank. It is a listed regulated substance used in the P80 process. ASI uses Propylene Oxide above the threshold quantity and is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations define a Program 3 process to be one that has the potential for offsite impacts from a release and is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program or is classified in one of nine Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.\r\nBecause Propylene Oxide is regulated for risk of accidental release, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that an RMP be utilized for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases. This Risk Management Plan has been developed in accordance with Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under 40 CFR part 68 to provide guidance on how to prevent, prepare for and respond to a chemical emergency involving propylene oxide.\r\nThe Offsite Consequences Analysis\r\n\r\nThe population estimates are very conservative (the numbers are likely higher than in the year 2010 - U.S. Census).  MARPLOT is used to calculate the population within the area plotted by ALOHA.  The 2010 Census data shows population for the City of Kenedy is 3296.  The 2019 RMP update uses the ALOHA program to calculate distance to the Toxic End Point for"

The 2019 uses urban/forest to allow for the buildings located in the City of Kenedy located just to the north west of the plant. \r\n  \r\nThe Accidental Release and Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nASI is dedicated to providing a safe and healthful environment for employees, customers, and communities and remains an OSHA VPP Star site.  This facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  All management practices associated with Responsible Care Program compliance are reviewed frequently to assure all provisions are in place and operational.  Detailed emergency plans are in place at the plant.  HAZMAT recertification is conducted annually, and annual drills are held to involve the entire plant.  \r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\nPropylene oxide is handled in the bulk chemical storage and unloading area.  Typically, propylene oxide is delivered to the plant biweekly in tanker trucks which carry approximately 44,000 pounds each.  The truck is parked in the unloading area using procedures that assure the chemical holding portion of the truck is within the protected area.  The protected area has a trench around the perimeter, which is intended to catch any releases of propylene oxide.  The trench drains to a concrete lined neutralization pit where it can be pumped to another container or otherwise controlled.\r\nThe truck is hooked up to the unloading system using dry disconnect, 2-inch, stainless steel wire wrapped, flex hoses.  Dry disconnect fittings prevent release of chemical as the hoses are connected and disconnected.  Propylene oxide is pumped from the truck to the holding tank through stainless steel pipe.  All vapor associated with the unloading procedure is vented back to the truck with no release to the atmosphere.  A pressure relieving system is in place to release pressure in unloading lines to a scrubber.   The tank sits within a concrete containment dik"

The process equipment is designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards.
