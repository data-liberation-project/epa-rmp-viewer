If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel have been instructed and are prepared to work with the Worcester County Emergency personnel, the Snow Hill Fire Department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the Snow Hill facility of Royster-Clark, Inc., is the blending and storage of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users (farmers).\n\nAqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored, and used from the storage tanks in the production of mixed-grade liquid fertilizer for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia stored at this facility would be 90,000 pounds in 1 - 12,000 gallon tank  which is located in a 8,056 square foot dike.  This would be 27,000 pounds of ammonia at the maximum of 30% ammonia content.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of Aqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia from  the 12,000 gallon storage tank in the diked area released as a liquid over a 306 minute period.  The maximum amount released would be 90,000 pounds of Aqua Ammonia which would contain 27,000 pounds ammonia at 30% maximum ammonia content.  The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of ammonia, as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degadis - and the passive mitigation of the 8,056 sq.ft. dike, is 0.61 miles.  The release would affect 550 residents, a recreation area, some commercial operations, and a prison/correctional institution.  The possibility of this worst case release occurring is extr"

      "SummaryText": "emely unlikely as location personnel regularly inspect and repair as necessary all storage tanks.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release of Aqua Ammonia from a ruptured 3 inch transfer hose, during the unloading procedure, with the release discontinued in 1 minute.  The calculated quantity of Aqua Ammonia released would be 1500 pounds which is 450 pounds of ammonia, based on the maximum of 30% ammonia content. The distance to an end point of  200 ppm of ammonia, as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degadis, is 0.07 miles. This is 370 feet and would  affect 50 residents and some majior office and industrial areas.  The possibility of this alternate release scenario occurring is unlikely as Snow Hill personnel periodically inspect, repair and replace equipment according to industry standard procedures.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release prevention program:\n\nThe Snow Hill facility has implemented the provisions of Aqua Ammonia supplier's recommendations for safe handling of Aqua Ammonia and appropriate OSHA regulations.  Additionally, periodic training in handling, storage and use of Aqua Ammonia is conducted with personnel at this location.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that has caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or has resulted in any off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has:\n\na. A written emergency response plan which is incorporated in the written community emergency response plan of Worcester County.\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  \nThis facility's emergency response program has been discussed with and reviewed by the Snow Hill Fire Departme"
