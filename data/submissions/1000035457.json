      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - SARSEN GAS PLANT\r\n\r\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., owner and operator of the Sarsen Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Sarsen Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant where it is first dehydrated to remove water.  The gas is then sent through refrigeration dew point control units where the condensable liquids are extracted from the methane gas stream.  The liquids are then sent to one of several 60,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks awaiting truck loadout.\r\n\r\nThe Sarsen Gas Plant also has a de-propanizer to separate and fractionate propane from the natural gas stream.  The propane is then pressurized and stored in a 60,000 gallon pressurized storage tank awaiting removal by truck loadout. The methane sales gas is compressed and distributed downsteam via pipeline.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case accident scenario was determined by looking at several scenarios and determining which would have the greatest off-site impact.  The three scenarios chosen were the release of the entire contents of a 77,758 gallon NGL tank, the release of a 77,758 gallon propane tank, and the release of a 16,800 gallon atmospheric tank.  Modeling using the RMP-COMP model shows the worst-case scenario is the release from NGL storage tank.  Administrative controls limit the volume of the tank to 80% of capacity and a high-level shutoff valve proh"

To be conservative it was assumed the flow would be unabated for five minutes until the valves could shut and flow ceased.  At a flow of 200 gallons/minute this would cause the release of approximately 1,000 gallons of NGL.  Using the typical concentrations and specific gravity of products this amounts to a release of 4,778 pounds of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemica"

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additiona"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, and initial startup of a new process.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Sarsen Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  Team membership will include at least one person knowledgeable of the system being audited.  One member of the team must be qualified to lead the audit and be familiar with the auditing protocol being administered.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel.  Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\r\n\r\n2. Fire and gas detection systems interlocked with plant process controls and ESD system.\r\n\r\n3. Facility wide ESD system with process interlocks and strategic location of emergency pull stations.\r\n  \r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1.  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n\r\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\r\n\r\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n\r\n4.  Curbing or dyking to contain liquid releases.\r\n\r\n5.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1.  Trained emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\n2.  Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Sarsen Gas Plant has had no accidents since its inception within the past 5 years.    \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Sarsen Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.

The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident.  The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions that are identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.
