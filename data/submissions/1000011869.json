      "SummaryText": "1.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CERTIFICATION\n\n1.1    SITE INFORMATION\nThe main operation of Delta St. Gabriel is contract chemical packaging, warehousing and distribution.  The facility was completed and began the packaging operation in 2002.  The facility is situated on approximately 11 acres located at 3950 Highway 30 South, St. Gabriel, Louisiana 70776.\n\n1.2    ACIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES\nDelta St. Gabriel is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, instillation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training on facility processes. It is DeltaA?s policy to implement appropriate controls to reduce and prevent the release of regulated substances. Delta has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response.\n1.3     THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Delta St. Gabriel facilityA?s primary activities are packaging, warehousing and distribution of chemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below.  Delta St. Gabriel receives the regulated substances in bulk tanker trucks, rail cars and iso tanks and transfers them to 55-gallon drums, 275 gallon totes and other smaller containers.  Filled containers are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite. \n\nChemical    CAS No.\n\nToxic Substances:    \nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate    584-84-9\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate    91-08-7\nEthylenediamine    107-15-3\n\n1.4    THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nDelta St. Gabriel is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 A? Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Delta St. Gabriel "

      "SummaryText": "is a Program 2 level facility.\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPAA?s RMP*Comp program was used to evaluate off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenarios for the two toxic regulated chemicals involve the catastrophic failure of a rail car (est. 17,300 gallons.) and/or a tanker truck (est. 6,000 gallons). The alternative release scenarios for the two toxic chemicals involve the puncture of a drum and release of its entire contents inside the warehouse (est. 55 gallons). Neither one of these scenarios is likely to result in the actual loss of the entire amount of the regulated substances from the vessel because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniques, but for the worst case and alternative case scenarios these situations were used as potential possibilities that could have offsite consequences, as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and 40 CFR 68.28.\n\n1.5    THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nDelta St. Gabriel has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The packaging and warehouse process at the facility is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Delta St. Gabriel is subject to EPCRA Section 313 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information  \nDelta St. Gabriel maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process. \n\nProcess Hazard Review\nThis facility conducts process hazard reviews to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled efficiently.

The process hazard analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revised as needed when there is a change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Delta St. Gabriel maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nDelta St. Gabriel has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive training before starting work. Operating procedures are reviewed annually and more frequently as needed. \n\nMechanical Integrity \nDelta St. Gabriel carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure valves and systems, hoses and piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdowns systems and controls. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. These personnel receive specialized on the job training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Delta St. Gabriel to manage changes in chemicals being packaged, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators and maintenance personnel whose job tasks are affected by a change or modification of process conditions are made aware of the changes.\n\nP"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nDelta St. Gabriel conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly. \n\nIncident Investigation\nDelta St. Gabriel promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from recurring. Reports are retained in the web based CMS system.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDelta St. Gabriel believes that incident prevention is a team effort and involves employees in the incident prevention process. Delta employees have access to the information created as part of facilityA?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Delta St. Gabriel has a policy of informing the contactors of known potential hazards related to the contactorA?s works. Contractors are also informed of emergency procedures should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n1.6     FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has been no release of RMP chemicals at the Delta St. Gabriel site over the past 5 years.\n\n1.7    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nDelta St. Gabriel has a written Contingency Plan for responding to accidental releases of hazardous materials.
