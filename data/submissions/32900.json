Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 13 states.  Fifteen processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest US grain companies.  In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, and livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms, Rockingham Roaster facility is a poultry processing plant located approximately 1,500 feet west of Long Drive in Rockingham, North Carolina. The facility has a wooded area to the southeast and residences to the southwest and to the north. The facility is a chicken cooking process plant which employs approximately 1051 associates to receive chicken and turkey meat plus other raw ingredients to form, prepare and package for distribution to the market place.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\nThe regulated substance used at the Rockingham facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in its cooling system.  The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia used in this process is approximately 47,068 pounds, distributed throughout various refrigeration components (compressor, pressure vessels, condensers, etc.).  The majority of the refrigeration components are located on the roof, though piping is located throughout the facility\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.
