We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n?    An overview of our emergency response program\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur production facility has produced propane (C3), isobutane (iC4), and normal butane (nC4), which contain minute amounts \"heavier\" components often referred to as natural gasolines (C5 & C6).  The facility is a fractionator that uses a feedstock known as commercial butane.  The Petal fractionator is a natural gas liquids processing facility, which fractionates the commercial butane into propane, isobutane and normal butane.  Since the last reporting period, the fractionator facility has been decommissioned.  It has been deinventoried of hydrocarbons, placed under an inert (nitrogen) environment, and is isolated from the remainder of the facility.\n\nThe storage tanks associated with this facility remain in service.  These tanks contain the following chemicals that the EPA has ide"

We have a training program in which the Operations/Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operations of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies as well as training in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use and apply the guidelines of our Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which include all of the above listed areas.\n\nThe Operations personnel make regular walk-through inspections of the equipment and process they operate.

The way we do business, with specific accountabilities and controls in place ensure that we are meeting our own high goals for accident prevention.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  There have not been any reportable releases, which involved any type of accidental releases involving material covered under the EPA's RMP rule, during the past five years at this facility.\n\nIf there is a reportable incident, Enterprise will conduct a formal incident investigation(s) to identify and correct the root causes of the event(s).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting our employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Petal Dome Mutual Aid as well as the community emergency response organization.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following lists actions that we have completed or are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n?    We are consistently reviewing and improving our PSM Program.  The program has recently been reviewed and written management systems have been updated and strengthened.\n?    We incorporated an electronic system that organizes, tracks and files all of the management of change projects.\n?    The mechanical integrity program is presently being reviewed and updated.\n?    The Safety Procedures are periodically reviewed and updated.\n?    We plan to conduct safety inspections of the operating process units as well as continue to conduct PSM audits.\n"
