The manufacturing processes consist of thawing, mixing, cooking, packaging, maintenance, and shipping activities. The regulated stationary source at this facility is the ammonia refrigeration system, which contains anhydrous ammonia.  It is utilized at the facility as a refrigerant to cool the buildings and freezers. This substance is listed as a Regulated Toxic Substance under 40 CFR Part 68 and is present in quantities that exceed the threshold for Accidental Release Prevention. \n\n\n\nLand O'Frost's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by Land O'Frost's installation of the latest technology in process controls and monitoring detection systems. The properties of ammonia that make it valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. \n\n\n\nLand O'Frost's policy in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of ammonia is to contact local emergency agencies for assistance as well as necessary contractors needed to respond, clean up and restore facility functions to normal. Land O'Frost adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Searcy facility complies with the Program 3 requirements of EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule through the implementation of the Process Safety Management rule of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910"

The Process Safety Management Plan is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, and employee participation. \n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management Program ensures that the process and the equipment in the process is designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards and that the process is operated according to good engineering practices. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled inspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment. Preventative maintenance and replacement policies for parts and equipment ensure that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a release incident.   All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to ensure an uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia is prevented.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nA small release happened on August 6, 2010, when a instrumentation fitting failed. The facility was evacuated and the local fire department was notified. The fire department quickly isolated the leak and an Incident Investigation commenced. The findings of the investigation suggested all similar fittings be replaced with a sturdier design, much less susceptible to vibration failure. All similar instruments were replaced by August 13, 2010.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nLand O'Frost has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120) that includes provisions to respond to chemical emergencies on-site with trained Land O'Frost personnel and provisions to evacuate non-responding employees from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a hazardous che"

The emergency response program focuses on the following key elements: Emergency Telephone Call Log, Coordination with Local Authorities, Structure of Authority, Emergency Team Role Descriptions, Media Interaction Procedures, Emergency Notification Procedures, Emergency Evacuation Instructions, Personnel Accounting Procedures, Notification Procedures, Severe Weather, Bomb Threat, and Fire and/or Explosion.\n\n\n\nIt is Land O'Frost's policy to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. Land O'Frost has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local authorities will be notified by Land O'Frost and a joint decision will be made on whether local areas will be evacuated. The local authorities will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nLand O'Frost is committed to continuous efforts to improve the safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia process by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment and the system. The anhydrous ammonia process is designed in accordance with good engineering practices. Periodic auditing of the Process Safety Management Prevention Program ensures that any system changes or modifications are evaluated and necessary safety precautions and or safety improvements are made before the process is placed into operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
