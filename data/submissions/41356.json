      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Arizona Chemical Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Arizona Chemical Company, Dover, Ohio facility, is a versatile plant manufacturing several different product lines. We produce key ingredients for a wide variety of applications, such as additives to lubricants and greases, candles, plastics, tires, soaps, cosmetic bath oils, shaving creams, skin creams, printing inks and adhesives.  \n\nThe three principal feedstocks at Dover are naturally derived organic materials.  The primary feedstock is a distilled tall oil fatty acid derived from trees, and consisting mainly of oleic and linoleic acids.  The second feedstock is vegetable fatty acid that is also primarily oleic and linoleic acids.  These two materials are converted into a dimerized fatty acid, and either sold or used as a feed stock to the polyamide process or processed into other fatty acids.  The third feedstock is castor oil, which is converted into waxy materials that are used by our customers as ingredients in lubricants and greases.  \n\nRegulated Substances\nArizona Chemical has two chemicals that meet or exceed the 112(r) rule toxic chemicals threshold quantities (TQ's): anhydrous ammonia and ethylene diamine (EDA). The ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the fractional crystallization (solvent separation) process.  The EDA is used in the polyamide process as a reactant.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCorporate and Division polices emphasize not only compliance with all applicable environment, health and safety laws and regulations, but also the development, implementation and maintenance of an accident free, injury free and healthful workplace.    All managers are evaluated annually on safety and environmental performance, and are held accountable for compliance with all applicable regulations.  This is in accordance with corporate (International Paper) and division (Arizona Chemical) Environmental, Health and Safety Policies.\n\nArizon"

      "SummaryText": "a Chemical is committed to handling all hazardous substances safely to prevent their accidental release and to minimize the consequences of any such releases.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Program and General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been developed and implemented for the purpose of protecting worker and public health, and the environment.  \n\nIn-plant emergency response consists of training to prepare for, prevent, respond to, and recover from, emergency situations. Emergency training situations include potential hazardous material releases, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, and terrorism.  A plant specific incident command system has been installed.  The system is designed to be used for all types of emergencies, and is applicable to both small and large situations.  Plant-wide and community alarms are activated in the event of an emergency.\n\nIn addition to in-plant emergency response events, a system has been established in order to notify people outside of the plant.  Depending on the severity and type of event, the facilities/agencies notified include, but are not limited to: Union Hospital in Dover; Dover and New Philadelphia police, fire and ambulance services; the Tuscarawas County Sheriff; Tuscarawas County Local Emergency Planning Committee; and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency; and The National Response Center.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nArizona Chemical employs back-up safety systems, pressure relief valves, insulated vessels and piping, local emergency shut down systems, a containment dike for the EDA storage tank, a containment dike for the ammonia storage tank, and a closed loop system for ammonia to help mitigate the potential for leaks from the affected processes and equipment.  A perimeter monitoring and alarm system is used for the detection of ammonia, both inside and outside of the plant.  Arizona Chemical has a preventive maintenance program in place along with work planning, safety "

To ensure safe operations, operators are trained and certified. \n\nOperations are continuously monitored.   Written procedures are in place and implemented by operators.  Internal and independent audits of the ammonia and EDA operations are performed, and the results are used to improve the operations.  Both operations are covered under OSHA?s Process Safety Management Programs.\n\nWe have also installed a new security system to allow only authorized visitors onto the site.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere was 1 (one) reportable event in 2001.  In this event, less than 100 lbs of EDA was released.  This event was thoroughly investigated, and the root cause of the failure determined and corrected.  Lessons learned from this event were applied throughout the polyamide reactor system.  \n\nIn the last 5 years, there were no reportable release events involving ammonia. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nArizona Chemical has recently re-evaluated its ammonia refrigeration system, and the system is currently under going major changes related to operational reliability that simultaneously affect safety.  Since 1999 we have installed a deluge system capable of knocking down and mitigating an ammonia release.  We continue to explore mitigation measures to protect the community and environment from accidental releases.  Arizona Chemical is continuously evaluating other actions that would mitigate a possible release.\n\nManagement System\n\nArizona Chemical has established a management system to oversee the implementation of its environmental responsibilities.  The management system is designed to help ensure that each element of the program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified professional has been assigned overall responsibility for the development, imple-mentation and integration of the program elements.  Responsibility for i"

      "SummaryText": "mplementing individual requirements of Arizona Chemical's program have been delegated to competent individuals.  Arizona Chemical, Dover, has applied to become part of USEPA?s National Environmental Performance Track Program, as of 4/28/04.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\n\nThe Hazard Assessment portion of the 112(r) rule requires facility owners or operators to prepare \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios as appropriate to the operations. \n\nThe OCA of each chemical release was analyzed separately using appropriate air dispersion analysis and modeling techniques.  Arizona Chemical examined the results of several air dispersion models and modeling techniques which included the use of: equations given in the U.S. EPA RMP Offsite consequence Analysis Guidance document; the U.S. EPA Ammonia Refrigeration Model Plan; ALOHA; and SLAB.\n\nArizona Chemical used \"worst-case\" meteorological conditions for all modeling.  The 112(r) rule allows the use of more favorable dispersion conditions, such as increased wind speeds and a greater dilution factor for the Alternative Release Scenario analysis.  However, the topography surrounding the Arizona Chemical operations will frequently contribute to poor dispersion conditions, especially at night and through early morning.  The Tuscarawas River valley has hills on each side, which is a contributing factor.  We believe use of \"worst-case\" meteorology was prudent."
