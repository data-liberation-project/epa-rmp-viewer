If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Valley Park Fire Protection District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is an insecticide manufacturer for use by commercial applicators.  We use a number of different propellants in our aerosol insecticide can products.  We have one 12,000 gallon isobutane/propane mixture  tank (A-46), one 12,000 gallon demethyl ether tank (DME), two 2,000 gallon propane mixture tanks (A-52), and one 2,000 gallon difluouroethane tank (Dymel 152A) and one 2,000 gallon propane tank (A-108).  The two 12,000 gallon tanks are located in aboveground bunkers. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propellant system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving the propellant system that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propellant system, it is our policy to notify the Valley Park Fire District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and they are aware of their responsibility.     \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: A water deluge system was installed over the vertical propellant tanks in 2000.  The gas detection system in the gashouses was re"

The packaging and storing of the aerosol cans follow accepted industry standards.

We use a number of propellants in our insecticide aerosol can products.  We chose propane as a representative sample since it has the worst-case impact.  The quantity of cans stored in our warehouse puts us over the 10,000 lbs propane threshold.  The worst-case scenario is based on a single can exploding.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The isobutane/propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and state law.
