(Frederick Facility) are committed to safe operations and prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of an accidental release, the facility will work with local Fire Departments, the LEPC, and Emergency Management coordinator to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of a release on the community and the environment.\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n     The primary function of the facility is the storage and retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers in the surrounding area.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored on-site at this facility would be 56,078 pounds in the 12,000 gallon capacity storage tank (based on 56% filling density).\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:\n     The worst-case scenario would be the release of 56,078 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a 10 minute period; the discharge rate would be 5,608 pounds/minute.  Distance to the toxic endpoint is .72 miles, using the DEGADIS Model, and assuming urban terrain.  3600 people are estimated to be affected by this scenario.\n     The Alternative Scenario would be the release of 5,954 pounds/minute for 2 minutes, based on transfer hose failure; distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario would be .41 miles, using the DEGADIS Model, and assuming urban terrain.  Affected population is estimated to be 2600 people.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n     This facility has implemented the provisions of and is in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68; ANSI K-61.1; 29 CFR 1910.111; 40 CFR Part 355 (EPCRA); and 29 CFR 1910.38.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from this facility that have (a) caused any deaths or significant property damage at the facility nor (b) to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, "

      "SummaryText": "injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage or (c) met the criteria for reporting of accidental releases of ammonia under the provisions of 40 CFR Part 355.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n     This Facility has a written Emergency Response Plan, as prescribed in 40 CFR Part 68; 29 CFR 1910.120; and 40 CFR Part 355.  The Facility has provided the local LEPC and other planning agencies and authorities the emergency planning information for incorporation into other local emergency response plans, as required in SARA, Title III.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n     Safety improvement is a major priority and a continual process at this facility; recurring and periodic evaluations determine the status of working conditions, and identify possible changes needed for incorporation into process procedures.  There are currently no changes identified specific to this process, i.e. retail sale of Nitrogen Fertilizer. \n     Incorporation of group discussions relative to safety issues, provision of latest regulatory information and requirements, and other areas of concern are incorporated into the agenda for monthly safety meetings, as well as training sessions."
