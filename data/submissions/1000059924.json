However, since the facility is covered under Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulations, a copy of the PSM requirements and elements are maintained at the facility office.\r\n\r\nThe processes at the DRZ Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The DRZ Plant has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The DRZ Plant uses release detection systems such as hydrocarbon detectors and alarms, and release mitigation measures such as process relief valves, automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters and diking and containment to contain liquid releases.\r\n\r\nIV. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe DRZ Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention. No incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the facility within the last five years. Since plant startup, there has not been a release of any regulated substance.\r\n\r\nV. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nAn Emergency Response Plan has been developed for this facility and has been coordinated with local emergency response personnel. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect appropriate changes."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: DRZ\r\n\r\nI. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThis will serve as the Executive Summary of the policies, procedures and activities for compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, 40 CFR 68.79, for Breitburn Operating, L.P.'s DRZ Gas Plant. Breitburn Operating, L.P. and the DRZ Gas Plant are committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors, visitors, and the surrounding community and the environment. This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, design safety, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Breitburn understands that strong health, safety, and environmental principles, properly integrated into our management processes, and day to day practices greatly contributes to our business success.\r\n\r\nII. FACILITY DETAILS AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe DRZ Plant is located at 8718 Tangelo Road Grayling, Michigan in Beaver Creek Township, Crawford County. The plant has a regulated flammable mixture, comprised of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes. There are no threshold quantities of 112(r) regulated toxic substances at the facility. The DRZ Plant is a Program Level 1 facility because the distance to any receptor is greater than the calculated endpoint for the worst-case scenario, the facility has not had an accidental release of the regulated substances in the previous five years, and emergency response activities have been coordinated with local responders.\r\n\r\nIII. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe DRZ Plant is a Program Level 1 facility. Thus, an executive summary is not required"
