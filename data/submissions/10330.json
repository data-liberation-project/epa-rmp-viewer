THE RIGHT COOP TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN MAKING SURE THAT EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE NH3 AREA, ARE TRAINED EACH YEAR ON THE HAZARDS, OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES OF OUR FACILITY.  THE FACILITY IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED WITH STRICT ADHERANCE TO ALL LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL RULES WITH SAFETY ALWAYS IN MIND.  THIS COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED AN INJURY OR FATALITY AT THE STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC RELEASE OF APPROXIMATELY 262,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 3.36 MILES WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL OF AFFECTING 1000 PEOPLE.\n\nTHE PROPANE PLANT HAS 2 TANKS.  ONE 30,000 AND ONE 6000 GALLON TANK MAKE UP OUR SYSTEM WHICH IS INSPECTED BY THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL ON A REGULAR BASIS.  THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE PROPANE AREA ATTEND ANNUAL TRAINING AND BENEFIT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF PROFESSIONALS WHO TRAIN IN THIS AREA.  WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF A FIRE OR AN EXPLOSION RELEASING 110,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .4 MILES AFFECTING NEARLY 300 AREA CITIZENS.  AGAIN, BECAUSE OF OUR EXCELLENT TRAINING PROGRAM, THIS COMPANY HAS NOT HAD AN INJURY ACCIDENT AT THIS LOCATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN OF THE RIGHT COOP IS REVIEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WITH ITS EMPLOYEES AND PROVIDES THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WITH TOURS OF OUR FACILITIES TO BETTER FAMILARIZE THEM WITH THE DANGERS AT THIS LOCATION.  THE WRIGHT FIRE DEPT. HAS AGREED TO BE OUR FIRST RESPONDER IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
