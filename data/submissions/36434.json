As part of this commitment, EPFS has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at EPFS and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?S) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accident Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\n\nOne of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at EPFS.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at EPFS.\n\nThe RMP program at EPFS consists of three (3) elements:\n     1) A hazard assessment to help understand:\n\n                    -The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and;\n                    -accidents that have occurred during the last five (5) years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n     2) A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes     containing more than a threshold quantity of a     regulated substance (covered processes).\n     3) An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of     regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the RMP program at EPFS helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at EPFS.  In fact, EPFS is presently developing a comprehensive safety program to safeguard against the release of hazardous substances and limit injuries and damage to its employ"

When a hazardous substance is used at EPFS, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect EPFS workers, the public, and the environment and EPFS takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nEPFS prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at EPFS, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nEPFS limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  EPFS trains workers to respond to an emergency response, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, EPFS workers with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to limit injuries and environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at EPFS consists of a number of elements, many of which are required by the RMP rule.  These are the same elements defined under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule, which are required for this facility.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at EPFS that are required by the RMP rule."
