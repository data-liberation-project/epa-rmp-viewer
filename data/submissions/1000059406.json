Cargill receives Epichlorohydrin via tanker trucks and stores up to 147,000 lbs of Epichlorohydrin in an above ground storage tank.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nCargill has developed its Epichlorohydrin chemical release prevention program based upon the requirements of USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nDuring the past five years, no accidents involving the accidental release of epichlorohydrin have resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or any known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nCargill trains its employees initially (and annually thereafter) on its Emergency Action Plan and how to recognize / report emergencies to the appropriate facility personnel and government agencies. Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Dalton Fire Department and Whit"
