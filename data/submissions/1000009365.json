This emergency plan utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) and incorporates a three phase training cycle.  Further details on the training program are provided in the following section titled \"Emergency Response Program\"\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled \n\nThe City of Lewiston's Water Treatment Plant Facility is located at 2901 Rail Road, Lewiston Idaho.  The water treatment plant is located on the Clearwater River.  The plant is located one mile west of Potlatch Corporation, 120' south of the Clearwater River, 0.5 miles east of Highway 12 and 0.25 miles north of a residential and industrial area.\n\nThe plant treats 2.0-15.0 million gallons daily to service the greater Lewiston area.  The population served is approximately 13,500.  Chemicals are used in the following processes:\n\nPre-chlorination - Chlorine\nCoagulation - alum and lime (aluminum sulfate and calcium carbonate)\nSedimentation - none\nFiltration - none\nPost fluoridation - sodium silica fluoride\nPost pH adjustment - lime (calcium carbonate)\nPost chlorination - chlorine\nPumped into the distribution system\n\nThe regulated substance is 8,000 pounds of chlorine stored in four, one-ton cylinders liquefied under pressure.  Operators are on duty minimum 10 to maximum 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  One cylinder of liquid chlorine under pressure furnishes the necessary gas/water mixture to disinfect the influent and effluent (pre and post).\n"

A trainer spends time necessary to ensure fundamentals of chemical transportation, storage, use of a class \"A\" and class \"B\" repair kits, use of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), first response, first aid, and CPR certified, use of emergency operations plan, and action guide are known by all personnel.\n\nThe second phase is to exercise the skills they have learned.  Having drills on specific tasks, i.e., putting on the SCBA and using the \"B\" kit perform this.  Drills are conducted until all facility-operating personnel are proficient at their tasks.\n\nThe third phase is testing the emergency operations plan and skills that the employees learned.
