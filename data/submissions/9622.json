Our worst case release scenario would be the release of Propane from our largest storage tank which can hold a maximum of 27,000 gallons. According to EPA guidelines for figuring worst case release, it has to be assumed that the entire contents of the tank would be released and that all safety valves would fail and none of the manual valves could be closed. Also, the weather conditions would be such that none of the gas would dissapate into the air. If these conditions were to ever happen, using EPA RMP Comp. Version 1.06, the estimated distance to the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion would be .4 miles, which would cause an offsite impact.\n\n5. An alternative release scenario is one that would be the most likely to happen. This would be the rupture of a transfer hose. This scenario is also figured to EPA guidelines that all safety valves would fail and the release would last five minutes before an operator could shut off the flow of product. In this case, using EPA RMP Comp. Version 1.06, the estimated distance to the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion would be .09 miles, there would be minimal offsite impact.\n\n6. Technical Propellants, Inc. complies with regulations such as OSHA, PSM, and NFPA #58 which have guidelines for mandatory safety equipement that we have installed in our facility to avoid any accidental release.  We have always, and will continue to keep up with any new and improved measures that will help up maintain the highest standards possible for safety.\n\n7.  We have not had any accidental release at our facility in the past 5 years.\n\n8.

In 1994, we built a new state of the art manufacturing facility in Kay county Oklahoma. We built this plant according to all Federal, State and Local requirements, and with strict compliance to NFPA #58 and #70 specifications. We are committed to our employees, the public and the enviroment to operate our facility in a safe manner.\n\n1. When we designed our Oklahoma plant, all of the requirements of NFPA #58 to control an accidental release were built into it. We have always strived to keep up with the changing regulations for the products that we handle, and also any new safety devices that help insure that we do not have a chemical release.\n\n2. Technical Propellants, Inc. takes a very responsible attitude toward safety. Proper emergency planning and response are important elements of any safety and health program to help minimize employee exposure and injury. We have an emergency response policy in effect at this facility with a copy on file with Emergency Management of Ponca City.  To comply with RMP regulations we have updated them to include written instructions to alert our employees, the Emergency Management of Ponca City, and required responders in case of an emergency. We have also included safe distances, and places of refuge, site security and control, evacuation routes and procedures.\n\n3. Technical Propellants, Inc. of Ponca City is located in Kay County Oklahoma. The office building is located 650 feet off the road. The tank farm consists of 7 steel ASME pressure tanks that contain our products and is located Southeast of the office building. We are a manufacturer of aerosol propellants. We receive raw LPG; ie- Propane, Isobutane and Butane into our plant by tank trucks. We process these products through moleculoar sieves that take out the impurities in the gas. It is then stored in tanks for shipment. Per our customers specifications we lo"
