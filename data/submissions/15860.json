      "SummaryText": "he worst case scenario for the 5 cylinders located at the Cooling Tower comprises a release of 2,000 lbs from one cylinder.  Under this scenario the end point distance from the site was 1.4 km or 0.9 mile.  The estimated exposed population within the impact zone for this scenario is 3180 based on census tract information.  The alternative case for the 5 cylinder location is a single cylinder release which results in a toxic endpoint of less than 1 mile from the site.  The estimated exposed population within the impact zone for this scenario is 30 based on census data. The worst case scenario for the 7 cylinder location is a single cylinder rupture.  Based on a single cylinder rupture, the toxic end point distance from the site for this scenario is .1 mile.  The estimated exposed population within this impact zone for this scenario is 30 based on census data.  The alternative worst case scenario for the 7 cylinder location is also a single cylinder rupture.  The toxic end point distance from the site for this scenario is less than 0.1 mile.  Under this scenario, the estimated exposed population within the impact zone is 30 based on census tract data.\nMitigation and administrative controls is by safe use of the cylinders in accordance with standard operating procedures for the cylinders as established by Pinellas.  \n\n\n\n(d) The general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nRESPONSE:\tThe general accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps include:\n\n1.
