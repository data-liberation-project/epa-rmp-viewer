The facility possesses no more than 12 one ton cylinders at any time one site.  The chlorine is used as a biocide.  Chlorine has been used in accordance with the facility's safety procedures has been without incident at the facility.\nThe Chlorine processes at Pinellas are subject to OSHA 1910 requirements for Process Safety Management.  Compliance with the 1910 requirements as supplemented by the RMP specific requirements are the basis for the Pinellas's accidental release prevention program.\nThe response program includes notification of the County's HAZMATT team located at Pinellas Park  Fire Dept in the event there are any incidences/or releases of chlorine.  Personnel at Pinellas are trained in the notification procedure.\n    \n\n(b) The stationary source and the regulated substance handled:\n\nRESPONSE:    Wheelabrator Pinellas is a Resource Recovery Facility ('RRF') that converts municipal solid waste into electrical energy through a combustion process.  The sole regulated substance subject to the RMP requirements is Chlorine as used in (a) above.\n\n\n(c) The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s) including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\n\nRESPONSE:    Chlorine cylinders are located at two sites.  Five (5) cylinders are located at the cooling tower and seven (7) cylinders are located at Pond Pump Station Chlorination Building.  T"

Under this scenario the end point distance from the site was 1.4 km or 0.9 mile.  The estimated exposed population within the impact zone for this scenario is 3180 based on census tract information.  The alternative case for the 5 cylinder location is a single cylinder release which results in a toxic endpoint of less than 1 mile from the site.  The estimated exposed population within the impact zone for this scenario is 30 based on census data. The worst case scenario for the 7 cylinder location is a single cylinder rupture.  Based on a single cylinder rupture, the toxic end point distance from the site for this scenario is .1 mile.  The estimated exposed population within this impact zone for this scenario is 30 based on census data.  The alternative worst case scenario for the 7 cylinder location is also a single cylinder rupture.  The toxic end point distance from the site for this scenario is less than 0.1 mile.  Under this scenario, the estimated exposed population within the impact zone is 30 based on census tract data.\nMitigation and administrative controls is by safe use of the cylinders in accordance with standard operating procedures for the cylinders as established by Pinellas.  \n\n\n\n(d) The general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nRESPONSE:    The general accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps include:\n\n1. Conformance to the Safety Procedures as established for chlorine use at the site including conformance with the OSHA 1910 Process Safety Management requirements .\n2. Training of all personnel in the Safety procedures for chlorine use.\n3. Cylinder inspection of the chlorine cylinders and the associated delivery system  in accordance with the preventative maintenance monthly checks.\n4.
