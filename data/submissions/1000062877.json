Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The Rogers Water Utilities Rogers Pollution Control Facility, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide used in the covered process. The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards. \r\n\t\r\n4.2 Hazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Rogers Water Utilities Rogers Pollution Control Facility performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards. Checklists are used to guide the hazard review. These checklists include items to help ensure The Rogers Water Utilities Rogers Pollution Control Facility operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\r\n\r\n4.3 Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Rogers Water Utilities Rogers Pollution Control Facility develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations sh"
