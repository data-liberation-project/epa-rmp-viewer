This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass the manufacture of citric acid. We have one regulated substance at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in the fermentation of dextrose to citric acid.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 65,000 lbs.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate release scenarios we have used EPA?s RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants and EPA?s RMPComp software. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted involves a catastrophic release from the Ammonia tank. In this scenario 65,000 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. At class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography a distance of 3.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nTHE AMMONIA ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves the failure of a transfer hose at the ammonia storage tank. This scenario would release 2000 lbs. of ammonia over a 15 minute period. Under neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric stability and a 3 m/s wind speed and assuming urban topography the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.1 miles.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEA"

      "SummaryText": "SE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1 1989 edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS ? Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What IF/Checklist method. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA review for the Ammonia (anhydrous) system was performed December 3, 2001.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES ? For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered process Tate & Lyle maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a maintenance shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTRAINING ? Tate & Lyle has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as needed. \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY ? Tate & Lyle carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to insure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shut"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE ? Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPRE-START UP REVIEW ? Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Tate & Lyle. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS ? Tate & Lyle receives corporate audits on a regular basis to help determine compliance to PSM and RMP standards. These  audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any required corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. In addition, the Dayton facility was audited by the Ohio EPA on September 20, 2001.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION ? Tate & Lyle promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are under taken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICPATION ? Tate & Lyle truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend impro"

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis.\n\nCONTRACTORS ? Our company hires contractors to conduct specialized and routine maintenance and construction activities. Long term relationships have been established with the contractors that work on a routine basis. All contract personnel are required to have site specific training. This contractor training must be documented before a contractor worker is allowed on the job site. The contractor safety representative meets with a Tate & Lyle representative regularly. The contractor notifies Tate & Lyle about any incident involving a near miss, accident, or injury of contract personnel. Tate & Lyle keeps copies of meeting notes and incident investigation reports to document past safety performance. Tate & Lyle has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nWe have had two accidental releases involving a reportable quantity of Ammonia (anhydrous) in the past five years. The largest of these was 2000 lbs. As a result of the quick implementation of our emergency response plan there were no adverse off-site consequences related to these releases.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nTate & Lyle has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is up"
