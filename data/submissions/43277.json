      "SummaryText": "Family Tree Farms - Executive Summary\r\n\r\n\tFamily Tree Farms operates a fruit packing facility at 41646 Road 62, near Dinuba, Tulare County, CA. The facility is\r\nused to receive, clean, grade, pack and store seasonal stone fruit. The packing season runs from May through October. The \r\nnumber of employees varies widely depending on the season, from 15 year-round personnel to 360 at peak packing season. Packed\r\nfruit is stored at the facility in cold storage until shipped. The refrigeration system for the cold storage uses anhydrous\r\nammonia as a refrigerant, and so 3,800 gallons of this material is kept on site. Additionally, the facility heating systems\r\nuse propane, so up to 1,000 gallons of this fuel is also kept on site.\r\n\r\n\tThe ammonia is in a closed system, with minimal handling of the material required. The most serious risk of a spill\r\ncomes from the accidential rupture of the system storage container or piping, or a spill during unusual maintenance of the\r\nsystem. Ammonia refrigeration systems are widely used, and design features are included to minimize the risk of accidental\r\nrelease. This facility is modern and incorporates current safety design. However, Family Tree Farms has a policy that \r\nprevention is by far the best method of avoiding accidental releases of ammonia. Therefore, regular scheduled inspection and \r\nmaintenance is carried out to assure the system is in good condition. The company follows IIAR safety and maintenance \r\nrecommendations outlined in Minimum Safety Criteria For A Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System (Bulletin # 109 of the \r\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration). Maintenance personnel are given special training prior to unusual \r\nmaintenance operations to reduce the risk of accidental releases during maintenance.\r\n\r\n\tAn Emergency Action Plan is in place to react to accidental ammonia releases. The plan includes notification and \r\nevacuation plans for all employees, notification of emergency responders, and notificati"

This agency also makes annual inspections of the facility which among other \r\nthings allows the reponders to become familiar with the facility layout and equipment.\r\n\r\n\tAll employees receive training when first hired that includes a briefing on the ammonia refrigeration system and the\r\nhazards of ammonia. Full time employees receive periodic training on the emergency action plan and their duties and \r\nresponsibilities in the event of an accidental release. All seasonal employees are given training at the start of every \r\npacking season on the evacuation plan and what to do in the event of an emergency. Plant maintenance employees receive train-\r\ning in first aid for persons affected by ammonia, and in the use of breathing apparatus.\r\n\r\n\tPlanning for leakage of propane follows the plan for an ammonia release.\r\n\r\n\tFamily Tree Farms has had no emergencies related to hazardous or flammable materials in the last five years."
