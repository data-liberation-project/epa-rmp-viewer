      "SummaryText": "I. Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nTristar Terminals Guam Inc. (Tristar) is making a commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility. Tristar's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nII. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Tristar Terminal is a 253-acre facility that stores petroleum hydrocarbons in aboveground bulk storage tanks and flammable gas in the form of propane, also known as LPG.  Tristar stores no listed toxic substances subject to 40 CFR 68.130.  The only listed substance that Tristar stores at the Terminal is propane (a regulated flammable substance), which is resold to retailers on-island who sell it to home owners for cooking and heating of water.  The maximum amount of propane that is stored at the Terminal is 5000 barrels in a 38-foot diameter steel sphere.  The Tristar Terminal is a Program 3 Level facility.\n\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe following information describes how the Tristar Terminal addresses the RMP elements and the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n- Process Safety Information: The Tristar Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes. These documents address hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals at the plant, process technology, and process equipment.\n- Process Hazard Analysis: Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n- Operating Procedures: The Tristar Terminal uses operating procedures to safely operate the covered process. \n- Training: To compleme"

The program is intended to help employees understand the nature and problems arising from process operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards of the process. \n- Mechanical Integrity: The Tristar Terminal utilizes maintenance procedures to ensure equipment is properly inspected and tested and equipment deficiencies are diligently corrected.\n- Management of Change: The Tristar Terminal has a system in place that requires changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\n- Pre-startup Safety Review: The Tristar Terminal conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service. \n- Compliance Audits: A compliance audit of the Tristar Terminal was conducted in December 2016. \n-Incident Investigation: The Tristar Terminal has an Incident Investigation procedure in place, in the event it will need to be used. \n- Employee Participation: The Tristar Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team. \n- Safe Work Practices: The Tristar Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (2) a pe"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n- Contractors: The Tristar Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce generally during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities and to perform unique tasks. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety site rules, and (6) inform terminal personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. In addition, the Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. \n\nThe covered process at the Tristar Terminal has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The Tristar Terminal has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The Tristar Terminal uses release detection systems such as gas detectors, break away valves and excess flow valves to minimize releases.\n\nIV. Five-year Accident History\nThe Tristar Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances in the past five years.\n\nV. Emergency Response Program\nTristar Terminal employees will not respond to releases. The facility has coordinated arrangements with local response agencies to respond to releases. However, the facility has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of elements such a"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.The Tristar Terminal will continue to conduct training, process hazard reviews, safety audits, management of change reviews and incident investigations as applicable to continuously improve the worker and public safety."
