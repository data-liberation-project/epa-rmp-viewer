The plant is staffed by approximately 24 regular employees.  This plant is located south of Yuba City adjacent to the Feather River.  There are some residences and commercial/industrial occupancies nearby.  The facility processes wastewater from several sources in the City and surrounding communities.  The wastewater plant has a capacity of 10.5 MGD.  The City has one regulated acutely hazardous material located on-site, \"Chlorine Gas\".   \n\n\n\nThese EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Support Documents satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  \n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe WWTF accidental release prevention policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The facility adheres to all applicable procedures of the federal EPA Risk Management Program (EPA-RMP).  The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response of the community and local responding agencies.  It is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (ARP) is in compliance with the federal and state OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and is based upon the following key elements:\n\n1. A high level of training for the state-certified facility operators.\n\n2. A preventive maintenance program with strict adherence.\n\n3. Use of state of the art process and safety equipment to control and neutralize any accidental release of the chemical.\n\n4. The use of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.\n\n5. Performance of hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n\n6. Assignment of "

Implementation of an auditing and inspection program under the direction of the Plant Supervisor.\n\n\n\nThese policies and procedures are described in the Yuba City Wastewater Treatment Facility Process Safety Management Plan.  This plan, as required by state and local regulatory agencies, also contains information and procedures relating to chlorine processing equipment, handling, leak response and repair procedures, education and safety training.  It contains a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and various report forms.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM - PREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Yuba City Wastewater Treatment Facility accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, policy, and management practices.  It is in compliance with all EPA Prevention Program Requirements.\n\n\n\n1. Process Safety Information. The WWTF has developed and maintains written safety information about the chlorination process and the technology of process equipment used.  The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and to the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management.\n\n2. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been conducted appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards using the What-If Checklist and Hazard Review processes.  These processes include the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error.  It describes steps used to detect and monitor releases.  This PHA will be updated every five years and the WWTF will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\n\n3. Operating Procedures A? The WWTF has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions for the safe operational activities associated with the process.  These procedures are included in the facility operations manual and the Process Safety Management manual"

      "SummaryText": ".  The manual includes procedures for operation of all phases of the processes including normal and emergency shutdown of the process.  \n\n4. Employee Training: - All existing and newly assigned employees are trained and tested competent in all operating procedures.  Training documentation is maintained on all applicable employees, refresher training is provided as needed but no less than every three years.\n\n5. Mechanical Integrity - The WWTF has a preventive maintenance program (Mpulse CMMS) that ensures the mechanical integrity of its chlorination processing equipment, which includes periodic inspection, testing and an annual overhaul of critical processing equipment.\n\n6. Management of Change - The WWTF has implemented written procedures to manage changes (except changes in-kind) to process chemical technology, equipment, and procedures.  Employees affected by a change in a process are informed of and trained in the change prior to start up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operation procedures are updated accordingly.\n\n7. Pre-Startup Review - Written procedures (SOP)have been developed to allow operators to perform a pre-startup safety review for new and modified chlorination equipment, or where modification to the process is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n8. Compliance Audits - Compliance audits are performed every three years to verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  Wastewater personnel knowledgeable in the process will perform the audit.  A report will be developed and deficiencies will be corrected. The two most recent audits will be kept.\n\n9. Incident Investigation - The WWTF will investigate any incident, which results or could result in a catastrophic release of chlorine gas.  The investigation will be conducted within 48 hours of the incident.  All key factors will be addressed and recommendations for correction will result.  Affected "

Employee Participation - Managers and operators of the WWTF participated in the process hazard analysis.  The PHA has been made available to all affected employees and is kept at the facilities.\n\n11.  Hot Work Permit - A hot work permit program has been developed and implemented for hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorination process.  The permit documents the fire and accident prevention requirements and is implemented prior to beginning any hot work operations.  The permit is kept on file until the completion of any hot work. The WWTF is currently working with Du All safety to conduct Hot Work safety training.\n\n12. Contractors - Contractors working on or near the chlorination process are required to comply with the regulatory provisions of the OSHA process safety management standard. \n\n13. Injury and Illness Prevention Program - The WWTF has an active IIPP program meeting the requirements of Cal/OSHA Section 3203 that addresses the following;\n\n\n\n     A) Assignment of safety responsibilities\n\n     B) Programs designed to gain employee involvement such as safety reward and recognition, safety suggestion incentives, and safety rule infraction disciplinary programs.\n\n     C) An active safety training program\n\n     D) Hazard identification and corrective action program.\n\n     E) Incident and Accident investigation process.\n\n     F) Safety committee made up of union and management personnel.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe WWTP has developed and implemented an emergency response program. The emergency response program includes interaction and communication with local and state emergency response agencies.
