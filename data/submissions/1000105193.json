They are instructed to evacuate and travel upwind of the release a distance of 2 miles or until notified that evacuation is no longer necessary. Employees should notify 911 and their supervisor of the leak while evacuating, but should in no way delay evacuation to do so. Alarms will be triggered and the offsite operations center will be notified. \n\nElkhart Public Works and Utilities maintains a compliant Emergency Action Plan and makes coordination effort with the Elkhart Fire Department. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlanned changes include:\n\u2022\tStandard operating procedure for putting protection up to protect regulator when working above and/or shutting off\n\u2022\tFire detection systems\n\u2022\tStandard operating procedure for system maintenance\n\u2022\tAdding relief valves to preventative maintenance\n\u2022\tPersonal chlorine detectors to help with false alarm verification\n\u2022\tVerification of maintenance compliance with manufacturer and industry groups\n\u2022\tInspections before accepting tanks\n\u2022\tAdditional coordination with the Fire Department\n\u2022\tAdditional verification and labelling of pipes\n\u2022\tImprovements to facility doors"

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\nCity of Elkhart\nElkhart - Northwest Wellfield \n\nSource and Process Description\n\nThe City of Elkhart's Northwest Wellfield utilizes one covered process for chlorine.  This substance comprises the disinfection process for the treated water discharged from the plant into the Elkhart public water distribution system.   Following treatment for the removal dissolved minerals such as iron and manganese, chlorine gas is injected into the treated effluent to destroy residual living organisms that may include potentially pathogenic microbes, as well as provide a residual throughout the distribution system.  The oxidative power of the chlorine attacks organic formations and destabilizes their structures in very short periods of time, rendering the effluent acceptable from a water quality standpoint.  \n\nAt the plant site, the maximum quantity of chlorine gas that is stored at any given time is 6,000 pounds.  The substance is stored in 2,000-lbs pressurized vessels.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nManagement is committed to ensuring that the appropriate resources are available to meet all safety needs related to the covered process. \n\nTraining, investments in new technology, and diligent preventative maintenance are all key to preventing an accidental release.  \n\nIf a release occurs, visual and audible alarms will sound and be relayed offsite. All employees are aware of the need to evacuate and call 911. The Elkhart Fire Department will respond to all releases and is familiar with the process and response needs. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n \nOnly personnel that have been trained may operate or perform maintenance on the covered process. Electronic systems remotely monitor the covered process 24 hours a day. The covered process is enclosed to protect it from damage. A vacuum regulator limit the amount of chlorine that can be released due to damage o"
