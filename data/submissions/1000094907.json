This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Lebanon County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n\nFarmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3 considers protecting the health and well-being of our team members to be of the utmost importance. It is in this spirit that we devote great efforts to our health and safety programs. Priorities are placed on adherence to the occupational health and safety act along with hazard recognition and elimination. Team members are encouraged to always work safely and immediately report any unsafe condition to management. Through active discussion and participation, we will, together, enjoy a safe work environment.\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for the Farmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3 operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Farmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3 is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative cont"

As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Farmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3  RMP Plan on file at the facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios and potential population were determined through the use of data from the 2010 US Census Bureau in Marplot Mapping Program.\n\n\n\n- General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nFarmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3 has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Farmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3 has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Accident History\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility, therefore, there have been no ammonia related incidents at the Farmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3 site. \n\n\n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nFarmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3  current Emergency Action Plan focuses on evacuation and response of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. \n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nFarmers Pride, Inc. - Plant 3 currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to "
