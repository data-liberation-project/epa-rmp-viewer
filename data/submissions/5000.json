The facility was expanded in 1998 to treat 11.5 million gallons \nper day of groundwater to help meet the Citys domestic water service demands.  A gaseous chlorine system is used \nat the Bailey WCF to oxidize the iron and manganese in the influent well water and to provide a chlorine residual in \nthe water for disinfection.  The facility is equipped with chlorine detectors and a chlorine vapor scrubber system.\n\nThe facility is normally un-manned.  Operators and maintenance staff travel to the Bailey WCF from the Citys \noperation center at the Avenue Water Treatment Plant in Ventura.\n\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO ARPP RULE \n\nThe Bailey facility uses chlorine in quantities large enough to trigger the Environmental Protection Agencys \nAccidental Release Prevention Program (EPAs ARPP) and Californias Accidental Release Prevention Program \n(Cal ARPP).  One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are delivered to the plant by truck.  A maximum of 9 one-ton \nchlorine cylinders can be stored onsite in a building equipped with gas detectors and an automatic emergency \nscrubber.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nThe facility has not had any releases during the past 5 years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or \nproperty damage.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility is subject to OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  The City has developed a stringent PSM \nsafety program that includes the following elements:\n\n? Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed \nand installed.\n  \n? Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific infor"

Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n \n? Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same safety training that the City provides for its own \nemployees.\n \n? Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with stringent documentation of all \ninspections.\n \n? Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n \n? Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n \n? Stringent investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine releases.\n \n? Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regulated systems.\n \n? A site-specific Emergency Action Plan.\n \n? Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant staff are aware of the PSM \nprogram, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n \n? Independent audits of the entire PSM program and RMP program every three years.\n \n \n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n \n City staff uses its Emergency Action Plan to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency response in the unlikely \nevent of an accidental release.  The key elements of the emergency preparedness program are as follows:\n \n? All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n \n? The chlorine building is equipped with electronic chlorine detectors and an automatic emergency scrubber \nsystem large enough to handle the entire contents of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder.  The chlorine detector has an \naudible alarm and alerts the Citys central operations control room.\n \n? In the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact the City of San Buenaventura Fire \nDepartment.  \n \n? A team of City supervisors and operators are fully"

The Ventura Fire Department and the City \nHazMat team would jointly repair any major leaks.\n \n \n CITYS RECENT STEPS TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \n Based on recent safety reviews that were conducted as part of the evaluations for EPAs Accidental Release \nPrevention Program, the City has implemented the following actions to either reduce the likelihood or severity of \npotential chemical releases:\n \n? Update written operating procedures to include all PSM-required information.\n \n? Improve cabinets for storage and labeling of emergency repair kits.\n \n? Provide wheel chocks for the delivery trucks to assist with the unloading/loading of cylinders.\n \n? Improve labeling on process piping.\n \n? Upgrade the emergency repair kit by purchasing rubber sheets that can strapped around a damaged 1-ton \ncylinder to reduce leakage.  This repair method will be useful in reducing the impacts of an accident similar to \nthe Alternate Release Scenario described below.\n\n\nHYPOTHETICAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical accidental releases.  EPA requires \nfacilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dispersed to an ambient \nconcentration equal to the Toxic Endpoint Concentration.  Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds \nwere specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm but could interfere with \npeoples ability to leave the area.  The Toxic Endpoint Concentration for chlorine is 3 parts per million (ppm).  In \naccordance with EPAs rule, the following hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine  \n\nLiquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature) is imported to the site \nby truck and stored in one-ton containers for use "

The Administrative Worst-\nCase Release Scenario assumes that the entire contents of one of the chlorine cylinders (2000 pounds of chlorine) is \nemitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric \nconditions (1.5 meter/second wind speed and F stability) which would result in minimal dispersion of the gas \ncloud as it blew downwind.  The thermodynamic properties of chlorine indicate that such a large instantaneous gas \nrelease is probably impossible.  If the entire 2000 lbs of liquid chlorine were somehow discharged from the cylinder, \nit would spill on to the ground and immediately cool itself until it formed a puddle of chlorine ice, which would \ntake much longer than 10 minutes to evaporate into a gas cloud.   Nevertheless, the RMP rule dictates that the \nWorst-Case Scenario assumes the release of 2000 lbs of gaseous chlorine. \n\nGraphs from EPAs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants were used to calculate the downwind \nimpacts.  EPAs graphs indicate that the chlorine gas cloud would travel 1.3 miles before it dispersed to the 3 ppm \nToxic Endpoint Concentration.  Figure 1 shows a circle defined by the worst-case 1.3 mile downwind distance. \n\nAlternate Release Scenario for Chlorine  \n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for chlorine assumes that one of the 1-ton cylinders is dropped from the delivery \ntruck on to the ground outside the chemical building.  To be conservative it was assumed that the dropped cylinder \nlands on its weakest point, splitting a seam to cause an 8 x < crack.  It was also assumed that the dropped cylinder \ncomes to rest with the crack below the liquid level in the cylinder, allowing half of  the liquid contents to \nimmediately drain on to the ground.  The thermodynamic properties of chlorine dictate that 12% of the spilled \nchlorine would immediately flash to a vapor that would form a dense cloud that could blow downwind.  The \ntherm"
