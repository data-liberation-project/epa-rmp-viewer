It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our personnel is trained to mitigate or control the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Local HazMat Region 13 in Salem Oregon and Stayton Fire Department who provides additional emergency response expertise for our facility.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\r\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, which is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 70,498 in all PSM regulated systems in our facility.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\r\na.\tTo perform required off-site consequences analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Comp program. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis:\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario involves a catastrophic release from NORPAC's main plant ammonia refrigeration system. The scenario involves the release of 18,400 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a liquid form for over 10 minutes. The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 1,840 lbs/min. A distance to end point of 1.7 miles is obtained which affects an estimated residential population of 8,200 within this distance.\r\n\r\nToxic Alternativ"

One process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nNORPAC Foods Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\nOur facility has implemented and now conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-If Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of every three years. New management team is fully committed and any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, NORPAC Foods Inc. maintains written operating procedures.

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the process. \r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nNORPAC Foods Inc. has implemented a comprehensive training program in place to ensure employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Operators are encouraged to take the RETA (Refrigeration Engineers Technicians Association) CARO Certified Assistant Refrigeration Operator exam for new employees with one year of experience and the CIRO Certified Industrial Refrigeration Operator exam with three years of experience on the job. NORPAC's goal is to eventually request all operators to get these certifications as job requirement in order to operate our systems. Also, refresher training will be provided at least annually and more frequently as needed. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: \r\nNORPAC Foods Inc. has implemented and carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner as new expectation and fully supported by management. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\nWritten procedures are in place at NORPAC Foods Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology equipment, equipment and procedure"
