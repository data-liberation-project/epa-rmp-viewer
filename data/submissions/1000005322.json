Chlorine is stored at the site in a quantity greater than 2,500 pounds, the threshold level for the Accidental Release Prevention Rules set forth in the Clean Air Act, 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose this Risk Management Program is to achieve the following objectives: \n\u00c2\u00b7\tProtect public health and safety.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tReduce the potential of an accidental release of chlorine.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tMinimize the impacts should a release occur.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tComply with requirements of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, prepared by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) provides the basis for this Risk Management Plan. The chlorine storage and handling operation at the Marbach pumping station has been determined to be a Program Two process.  The results of a Hazard Assessment ( Off-Site Consequence Analysis) of chlorine showed that public receptors could be impacted in the event of a worst-case release of chlorine.  The facility is not subject to OSHA's process safety management plan rule and does not operate under one of the SIC codes listed in 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1). \n\nA Program Two RMP Accident Prevention Plan was prepared to provide information on management responsibilities, safety information on the chlorine process, results of a hazard assessment, written operating and maintenance procedures and descriptions of SAWS training, compliance audit and incident investigation procedures.\n\nSAWS has determined that it will rely on the San Antonio Fire Department emergency response team to coordinate off-site activities in the event of a significant release of chlorine.  SAWS has an emergency response program to train employees to identify the source of the chlorine leak and to implement emergen"
