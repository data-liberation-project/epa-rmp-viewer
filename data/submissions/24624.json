      "SummaryText": "CROP SERVICE CENTER, INC. OF SYLVAN GROVE, KANSAS IS AN AGRICULTURAL RETAIL BUSINESS WHICH SELLS ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AS WELL AS OTHER AGRICUTURAL INPUTS, TO AREA CROP PRODUCERS. THE FACILITY AT SYLVAN GROVE  HAS TWO-6,000 GALLON TANKS WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 53,000 POUNDS.  THE TANKS ARE DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR TANKS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE ALWAYS COMPLY WITH THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 26,500 POUNDS OF AMMONIA WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.19 MILES AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 300 AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE WOULD BE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE,  RELEASING NEARLY 12,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA  WITH A DISTANCE TO ENPOINT OF .83 MILES.  THE ONLY PUBLIC RECEPTORS WOULD BE A SCHOOL, RESIDENCES AND A PUBLIC PARK IN THE CITY. \n\nCROP SERVICE HAS TAKEN A PROACTIVE STANCE IN TRAINING THE EMPLOYEES WHO WILL BE WORKING THIS AREA.  EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF AMMONIA.  EMPLOYEEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF A  TYPICAL FACILTIY.  THE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  ABOVE ALL, THEY MAKE SURE TO HAVE CLEAN SAFETY WATER ON HAND DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.\n\nCROP SERVICE CENTER, INC. IS PROUD TO REPORT THAT THIS PLANT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED AN INJURY ACCIDENT OR PROPERTY DAMAGE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS SHARED WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT IN SYLVAN GROVE, AND THE COUNTY LEPC.  BOTH AGENCIES ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA."
