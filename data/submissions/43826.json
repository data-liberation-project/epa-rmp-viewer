The Facility Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of Beachner Grain, Inc., Neodesha, KS are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Wilson County LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\nOne of the primary processes at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application AS A NUTRIENT for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 242,800 pounds in storage tanks, and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Accidental (Worse-Case) and Alternate Release Scenario\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,100 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .94 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario, a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 1,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is <.25 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the Kansas Fertilizer Law and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \u00bfStorage and Handling of anhydrous ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "a.\u00bf  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3(b).\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n       - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n       -to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, \n29 CFR 1910.38;\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\nc. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n1. Within 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\nThe National Emergency Response Center @ 800-424-8802.\n2. Within 24 hours of determining the amount of release would effect the           environment, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\nKansas Bureau of Environmental Remediation @ 785-296-1679 or after normal business hours 785-296-0614 and the Kansas Department of Emergency Management @ 785-296-3176.\n\n7.\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
