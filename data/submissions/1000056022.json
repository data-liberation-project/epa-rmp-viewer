The Company's managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. WR Reserve has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances. Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program. In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing, and reporting such releases.  The company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nWR Reserve is a beef processing facility, that begins with a slaughtering process all the way through packaging.   To prevent contamination with harmful bacteria and to cool the final product, ammonia is used. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cooler temperatures in the various stages of the process. The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the site. The company is aggressively developing programs, policies, and materials requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Training for employees will be conducted to maintain a high level awareness when working with hazardous materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the Prevention Program, WR Reserve will develop a method to evaluate the Risk Management Program. This method will include periodic evaluations of the Program utilizing a Process Hazard Analysis and Compliance Au"
