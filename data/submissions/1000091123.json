FACILITY\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act establishes a Risk Management Program (RMP) to address the prevention of accidental chemical releases that can affect public health and the environment.  The program covers industrial facilities having more than a threshold quantity of certain specified hazardous or flammable chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe program focuses on chemical release prevention, detection, and accident response, and requires each facility to develop and implement a site-specific risk management plan including a hazards assessment, an accident prevention program and an emergency response plan.  The program requires facilities to review worst case release scenarios no matter how unlikely those scenarios may be, and identify ways to minimize impacts from such releases.\n\n\n\nThe Vertellus Zeeland Facility facility currently has two processes covered under this program.  The covered processes are as follows:\n\n-On-site storage and usage of ethylene, a primary raw material in the manufacture of a co-polymer product which has various applications.\n\n-On-site storage and usage of anhydrous ammonia, a raw material in the manufacture of ammonia salt product.\n\n\n\nThe facility is committed to minimizing the risk of adverse impacts from its operations, and our commitment to responsible operations is built directly into our business objectives.  This commitment is manifested further in our use of sound operating and maintenance practices, use of safety-conscious designs as well as extensive employee training.  In addition, the performance of periodic safety audits and incident investigations are designed to review and minimize risks to employees, the environment, and the community.\n\n\n\nThe facility continually strives to be an industry leader in environmental stewardship.  We continuously improve our practices in light of advances in technology and new understandings in safety, health "

We make consistent, measurable progress in implementing this commitment throughout our operations. \n\n\n\nOur focus on continuous improvement in the areas of safety, health, and environmental affairs is also demonstrated by our commitment to the Synthetic and Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association (SOCMA) Responsible Care initiative.  The facility has voluntarily adopted Responsible Care as its environmental, health and safety code of ethics.  We measure our success by our record of improvement in safety performance, reductions in waste and emissions, and involvement with the community.\n\n\n\nCOMPANY HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn 1935, a company named Chemical Specialties, Inc. was formed to manufacture the bulk active sedative Carbromal for the US market.  This company operated at the Centennial Avenue location.  Chemical Specialties, Inc., a privately held company, owned and operated the plant from 1935 to 1947.  Miles Laboratories, Inc. owned and operated a unit at the same location from 1947 to 1977.  Hexcel Corporation owned and operated a division at the same location from 1977 to 1992.  Cambrex Corporation owned and operated the site, at the time named Zeeland Chemicals, Inc., 1992 to 2003, at which time it was a division called Rutherford Chemicals, Inc.  In 2003, the Rutherford Chemicals, Inc. was acquired by Arsenal Capital Partners who later combined the division with Reilly Industries and renamed the company Vertellus Specialties, Inc.  Vertellus Specialties, Inc. was purchased by Wind Point Partners in 2007. Vertellus Specialties went bankrupt in 2016, and was renamed Vertellus Zeeland LLC, owned and operated by Vertellus LLC.  Pritzker Private Capital acquired Vertellus in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe facility provides the pharmaceutical and specialty chemical industries with the highest quality active ingredients, intermediates, and services. Our facility is registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and we maintain systems for ful"

Today the facility sells approximately half of its products to customers for use as active ingredients or as intermediates and auxiliaries that are used to produce pharmaceutical and food products.\n\n\n\nThe specialty chemicals produced by the facility are used in a variety of consumer products, including personal care products, dietary ingredients, photocopier chemicals and automotive parts.\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBLE CARE\n\n\n\nResponsible Care is a cornerstone of the Vertellus Zeeland facility environmental, health and safety (EH&S) management systems.  It is a chemical industry initiative through which companies commit to a continuous effort to improve their responsible management of chemicals.  The program began in Canada in the late 1980s and has since spread across the globe.  It has rapidly become the single most important performance improvement program within the chemical industry. \n\n\n\nIn adopting Responsible Care, the facility has agreed to conduct its business according to the following principles: \n\n\n\n-To recognize and respond to community concerns about chemicals and our operations.\n\n-To develop and produce chemicals that can be manufactured, transported and disposed of safely\n\n-To make health, safety and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new products and processes.\n\n-To report promptly to officials, employees, customers and the public, information on chemical related health or environmental hazards and to recommend proactive measures.\n\n-To counsel customers on the use, transportation and disposal of chemical products.\n\n-To operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects the environment, health and safety of our employees and the public.\n\n-To extend knowledge by conducting or supporting research on the health, safety and environmental effects of our products, processes and waste material.\n\n-To work with others to resolve problems created "
