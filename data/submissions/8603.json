      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of DAVISCO, Le Sueur Cheese Co., to adhere to all applicable state, federal and locl laws. If a emergency were to occur at this facility outside agency's would be called in depending on the magnitude of the emergency. The last year Le Sueur Cheese Co. has been doing major additions to it's plant so the emergency response plan, safety plans and coordination with the local fire department will have to be revised. These are scheduled to be done by 9-1-99.\n\n\n\nThis facility is a cheesemaking plant. We take in milk and process it into cheese then further process the by-products from the cheesemaking process into other dairy products. We use propane as a stand-by fuel for our boilers and heating units. If the company that supplies us with our natural gas has too much of a demand they have us go on stand-by fuel until the demand drops.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be if the tank would get hit and split releasing all the propane in it and a vapor cloud explosion would occur. This is a 30,000 lb. tank which will hold 110,000 lbs. of propane but is only kept 60% full or appox. 77,000 lbs. This tank is fencened in and protected by a steel post barricade.The amount of people that would be affected by this scenario would depend on the time of day and the weather conditions."
