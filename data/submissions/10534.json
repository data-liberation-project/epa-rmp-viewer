This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     \n\nThe Headlee Gas Plant, located in Odessa, Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to extract natural gas liquids from natural gas.  The Headlee Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including: Propane, Normal Butane, Isobutane, Ethane, and Methane.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Headlee Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest inventory of Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) contained in a single vessel/storage tank. The maximum inventory in this vessel/storage tank is 336,000 pounds.  The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.6 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Headlee Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of NGLs from a seal failure in a transfer pump.  The amount released would be 18,000 pounds in 15 minutes.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi"

New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify demonstrate (e.g., via verbal and written tests, skills demonstration, etc.) that the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors\n \nThe Headlee Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
