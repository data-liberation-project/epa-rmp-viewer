The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of the Macomb Water\n     Treatment Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of chlorine by\n     utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all\n     persons that work with the chemical.  Should an accident occur, the facility has orientated\n     the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for\n     response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the\n     environment.\n2.   Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is water treatment as a Public\n     Water Supply and in conjunction with this operation, the handling, storage, etc., of chlorine\n     for use in water treatment.  Chlorine is received, stored and used for disinfection.  The\n     maximum quantity stored would be 10,000 pounds in a facility process.   The capacities\n     of the individual tanks are 2,000 pounds.\n3.   The Worse-case Scenario:  Would be the release of the total contents of one tank released\n     as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,000 pounds, which\n     represents the volume of one storage tank as limited by design standards and company\n     procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is three\n     miles.\n     The alternative case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 5/16\n     inch valve body opening with 317 pounds release over 60 minutes.  The distance to the\n     endpoint of dispersion is 0.56 miles.\n4.   The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations as\n     set forth in the City of Macomb Risk Management Plan.\n 5.   The Five-year accident history:\n     There have been no accidental releases of chlorine"

      "SummaryText": "for the covered process in the past five\n     years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our\n     knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations,\n     sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n6.   The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in\n     accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the \n     emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA\n     Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local\n     fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination\n     in the community response planning.\n7.   Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the\n     facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and\n     operations.  There are no additional specific chlorine safety recommendations for\n     implementation at this time."
