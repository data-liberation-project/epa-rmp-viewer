As a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation. In addition, as part of this commitment, the Lima Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage risk at the Lima Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rule 40 CFR part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Lima Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RM Plan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n1.1 The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe ISP Lima Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will take appropriate action to minimize the effects of the release, summon the Emergency Response team (a shared service with Lima Chemicals, ISP, and Nutrien), and summon the nearby Shawnee Township Response Team, who are trained to respond to chemical emergencies.\n\n\n\nISP's BDO Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program for the EPA-regulated process at Lima.

Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated to designated technical staff.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n1.2  ISP's Lima Plant Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe ISP Lima Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located south of the City of Lima, Ohio, in Allen County. The Lima Plant's primary product is 1,4 butanediol (BDO). Other by-products are gamma butyrolactone (BLO) and Tetrahydrofuran (THF).  We use butane as our primary feed stock, which is received by pipeline from the Lima Refinery, which is adjacent to our facility.  Butane is a flammable gas and is present in the BDO process above the RMP rule threshold quantity. \n\n\n\n1.3 The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Lima Plant.  Because butane, which is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for chemical manufacturing facilities, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Employee Participation\n\n\n\nISP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees actively participate in behavior based safety observations of co-workers and contractors.  Employees also have access to all PHAs, incident investigations, inspection and observation documents and statistics.\n\n\n\n1.3.2  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Lima Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific personnel within the Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known safety concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their product/process operating manuals.  The Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\n\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing i"

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  ISP utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) method to guide in prioritization of these improvements.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Plant periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years an"

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. \n\n\n\n1.3.4  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Lima Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n1.3.5  Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, ISP has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training on site operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the "

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, and (3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  The Plant maintains a Contractor Safety Program, which specifically addresses contractor safe work practices and is reviewed for accuracy and updates every 3 years.  In addition, the Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n1.3.7   Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nISP conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
