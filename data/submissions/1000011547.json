      "SummaryText": "The Tohopekaliga (TOHO) Water Authority provides quality drinking water and treats the public's wastewater for much of Kissimmee and Osceola County.  The TOHO Water Authority takes the community's safety seriously and protects this community by disinfecting the drinking water before it enters your home and disinfecting wastewater prior to reentry into the environment.\n\nChemicals are an important part of this industry.  The TOHO Water Authority is committed to using chlorine safely for the disinfection of water and wastewater.  The TOHO Water Authority along with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would like the public to know about the chemicals that may be stored in the community.\n\nThe Camelot WRF operates a chlorination process to disinfect treated water at the chlorine contact chamber and the filter.  This procedure requires a total of 28,000 lbs of chlorine in storage and in use.  As a result of the quantity of chlorine at this facility, and to ensure a safe environment for its employees and the public, the TOHO Water Authority complies with hundreds of regulatory standards at its treatment facilities.  Providing an RMP for its treatment facilities is one way in which the TOHO Water Authority complies.\n\nThis facility typically employes two persons on-site full time 8-1/2 hours per day, seven days per week.  The staff routinely checks and maintains the chlorination equipment to prevent accidents.  Plant operators are trained to respond to leaks and receive 24-hour training to \"Technician\" level per OSHA Standard.  Operators receive an 8-hour refresher course annually.  All other employees that may come in contact with chlorine receive instruction to identify chlorine leaks and initiate response procedures.\n\nThe TOHO Water Authority and EPA would like to inform the public of the measures taken to assure public safety.  In the rare event of a chemical release, the staff is knowledgeable of the potential affected area so that they may implement a response sys"

Part of being prepared is determining the possible limits of influence for a hypothetical release scenario.\n\nThis facility is equipped with a chlorine scrubber which should prevent any release outside of the enclosed chlorine storage facility.  In addition, the chlorine storage facility is equipped with a chlorine leak detector which sends an alarm to the Operations Building in the event of a chlorine release.\n\nThe TOHO Water Authority has established a Safety Management Plan which complies with OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The Plan includes information and instruction on handling chemicals at the treatment facilities along with a Hazard Communication Program, Chlorine Handling Policy and Procedures, and Chlorine Information and Instructional Guides.\n\nThis facility has had no reportable accidents within the last five years.  The TOHO Water Authority is committed to keeping its staff trained and its emergency response procedures current.  It has updated its procedures to ensure rapid response to any potential accident.  The facility staff are trained in safe handling of chlorine equipment and cylinders and responding to leaking chlorine equipment.  The TOHO Water Authority has also held public outreach seminars to make the public aware of this and other similar facilities within the area.\n\nThe TOHO Water Authority continuously strives for quality water and wasteweater treatment and the safest conditions possible to protect its community."
