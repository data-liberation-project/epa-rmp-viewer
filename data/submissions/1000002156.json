      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPool Chlor Company (Pool Chlor) provides chlorination for recreational swimming pools in Southern California.  Pool Chlor has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1975.\n\nPool Chlor's owner is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The owner administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communication, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, Department of Transportation program, as well as the Risk Management Plan on file with Santa Fe Springs Fire Department.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company facility has been in operation since 1975.  The facility is located at 13716 Carmenita Blvd., in Santa Fe Springs, California 90670.  The system was constructed in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company facility receives and repackages liquefied chlorine into small 20 pound cylinders that are then used to treat water at local private residence swimming pools.  The maximum amount of chlorine on site is 7 one-ton containers (14,000 pounds).  The entire system including the fill station, one-ton containers, scrubber tank and pump, is located outside.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Pool Chlor Company chlorine transfer system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Pool Chlor Company facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nA chlor"

      "SummaryText": "ine sensor is located in the Chlorine Storage Area that activates a facility-wide alarm if chlorine is detected.  An uninterruptible power source (UPS) is used to power the chlorine sensor and associated displays in the case of a power outage.  The chlorine alarm status is monitored by an off-site company during off hours.  An emergency kill switch is interlocked with a motorized solenoid actuator valve to stop liquid flow from the active one-ton container.\n\nAll one-ton containers are maintained chained to a cradle.  The idle 20 pound cylinders are kept in a locked storage area with the scrubber pump and tank.\n\nAs policy, new Pool Chlor Company employees must be directly observed by an experienced operator while performing the chlorine transfer operation for six months of employment prior to being \"qualified\" to conduct the transfer operation independently.  This is considered a very conservative approach based on the simplicity of the operation.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Pool Chlor Company's accident history during the PHA Revalidation revealed that there have been no reportable chlorine releases over the past five years (March 2004 - March 2009) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPool Chlor Company has coordinated emergency action efforts with the local fire department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of Pool Chlor Company to evacuate and to allow the fire department and/or the chemical supplier to respond to the emergency.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The"

      "SummaryText": " emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPool Chlor has conducted a PSM/RMP Three-Year Compliance Audit (June 2008) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (March 2009) which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Pool Chlor Company facility.  The scheduled completion date of all changes resulting from the PHA update is March 2010.  In the meantime, Pool Chlor Company safety committee has completed several items, including some recommendations, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility's Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
