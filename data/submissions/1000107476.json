BASF's emergency response coordinator is also the chairman of the Local Emergency Planning Committee. A sheltering drill is completed on an annual basis.  A community and industrial park drill are also held from time to time. Access control to the industrial park was conducted. The McIntosh Industrial Park (MIP), Community Notification System, is a series of sirens located around the McIntosh community to alert residents to listen for an emergency message from one of the MIP plants over the Local Interest Safety Network (LISN) system.  The LISN system is a method of providing urgent messages to community residents regarding incidents at MIP plants.  Messages are played by calling 944-LISN.  MIP companies cooperatively manage the MIP Community Notification System.  Each MIP company can activate the community sirens (by phone or computer).  Then they follow established procedures (through the phone to First Call) to send prerecorded voice messages to the LISN system.  In addition, a Ring Down call system is used to automatically send the LISN message to all homes and businesses within a 3-mile radius of the MIP.  There is also a public broadcast AM radio (1610 AM) located in McIntosh that can be used as a tertiary level of community messaging and notification."

The alternative release scenario was based on process knowledge, accident history or the process hazard analysis conducted for the unit.\n\nOperators are always present during unloading operations of phosphorus trichloride to ensure the safety of the operation. The unloading operation is also monitored by a computer and by control room operator. Should a problem with the unloading occur, the containers are equipped with an emergency cut off valve, which can quickly be closed from the front of the truck.  Also, the unloading area is surrounded by a concrete dike that is large enough to hold the contents of an entire truckload of material. Procedures, training, safety systems, and preventive maintenance programs are all in place to prevent spills, but should a spill occur; this unit is well prepared to respond effectively. Training, procedures, safety systems, and preventive maintenance programs are all in place to ensure we will handle all materials safely. There is a full time professional Emergency Response Team (ERT) on-site 24/7/365 should any incident occur.  The ERT is notified prior to any offloading of PCl3 as part of normal protocol.  \n\nAnother critical element of the RMP regulations is to develop and submit a five-year accident history involving RMP-regulated substances. There have been no accidents or incidents which have any offsite impact or on-site injury during the last five years. \n\nTo deal with potential accidents and emergencies, BASF has an Emergency Action and Response Plan in place.  Also, there is a written contingency plan for the Area 15 treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) facility.  The contingency plan is part of the RCRA part B permit application.  The BASF site also has its own fire department with its own firefighters, hazmat team, emergency medical technicians and paramedics in addit"

Some of the chemicals produced in Area 20 include light stabilizers, antioxidants, and oil additives. \n\nThe Energy and Environmental Operations Unit controls all the boilers and utilities, as well as the hydrogen storage and distribution, and wastewater system. A waste management facility (Area 15) also exists on site which includes an aboveground wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that treats sanitary and process wastewater generated at the plant. \n\nThe RMP-regulated substance at the site in quantity exceeding the threshold planning quantity is phosphorus trichloride.\n\nThe first key element in the RMP regulations is that a facility must identify all processes that contain any RMP-regulated substances above their designated threshold quantities. Phosphorous Trichloride is the only RMP regulated chemical that exceeds the threshold quantity. \n\nThe second key element in the RMP regulations is to determine program levels for the RMP-regulated processes.  These levels range from a Program 1 that imposes minimal requirements on a process to a Program 2 or 3 which require a much greater level of effort.  The McIntosh site is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The sites processes are also included in the nine SIC codes specified by the RMP rule.  Therefore, the facility has designated all of its RMP-subject processes to be in the Program 3 level of the RMP.\nThe third key element in the RMP regulations is that Program 3 facilities must conduct an offsite consequence analysis.  BASF opted to use the EPA, RMP Comp because it is more conservative than most commercial models.

The site occupies approximately 1,500 acres and has approximately 600 BASF and contract employees on site. Production at the McIntosh site began in 1952 with 32 employees manufacturing one product.  Currently, the site produces additives for plastics, paints, and oils, and chemicals used in household products.  \n\nThe McIntosh site continues to be a leader in safety.  Employees at the site have formed unit safety teams (USTs) which are dedicated to addressing unit safety and environmental issues.  The line of products at McIntosh may vary in response to market demand. A brief description of each production area follows below:\n\nThe Antioxidants and Metilox Area 1 is designed to produce Irgafos (process stabilizers used primarily as blend components) and Irganox (antioxidants).  In this Area, raw materials and solvents are fed to reactors.  The reaction mass undergoes additional processing steps such as stripping, crystallizing, centrifuging, blending, and drying.  The products are then either packaged dry or transferred to the granulations area.  Solvents used in the process are recovered and reused. \n\nThe Tinuvins Area 17/18 is designed to produce various additives by diazotizing o-nitroaniline with sodium nitrite in an acidic medium.  The resulting diazonium salt is reacted with one of several substituted phenols.  The intermediate is then separated from the reaction mass and dissolved in a solvent before being reacted with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to form the corresponding additive product.  The catalyst is then removed from the reaction mass, and the solvents partially stripped off.  The product is finally purif"
