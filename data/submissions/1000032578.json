      "SummaryText": "Gavilon manufactures ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer as 10-34-0 or 11-37-0 by combining super phosphoric acid with ammonia vapor.  The reaction occurs by combining the ammonia vapor and superphosphoric acid in a simple pipe or reactor tee under anhydrous conditions.  After combination, a reaction occurs which releases heat (with temperatures of 575?F to 650?F) and produces a highly polymerized, partially neutralized \"melt\".  The heat of reaction causes several chemical changes to occur.  First, water is removed as steam, and phosphorus atoms in the super phoshoric acid combine to form polyphosphate molecules.  Secondly, the anhydrous ammonia reacts with these molecules (i.e. polyphosphate molecules) to produce the ammonium polyphosphate melt.  \n\n\n\nThe highly polymerized, partially neutralized \"melt\" formed within the pipe is discharged into a hot well where it is dispersed, dissolved by the addition of water and neutralized with aqua ammonia to a final pH of 6.15 - 6.30 and a specific gravity of 1.395 - 1.420 @ 100?F (depending upon the final product).  It is then cooled evaporatively by recycling through a tower packed with pall rings and collected at the base in the mix tank.  The product, containing 60-80% polyphosphates, is then pumped through a heat exchanger that is also used to vaporize the reactant ammonia and cool the product to below 100?F.  It is then routed to storage.\n\n\n\nAt the Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC - Jamestown facility, Gavilon maintains a 30,000 gallon ammonia storage tank.  The ammonia storage tank and associated ammonia handling equipment are subject to 40 CFR, Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention and 29 CFR, Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\n"
