Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), Marianas in accordance with directives from the Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy maintains, implements, and updates plans and instructions for the protection of worker health and welfare, and for the protection of the environment.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe NAVFAC Marianas's U.S. Navy Reservoir Booster Pump Station (Building 1282) is located on Lower Harmon Road at the Naval Base Guam Munitions Site (NBGMS). This is a fully enclosed, concrete facility holding two (2) one-ton (2,000-pounds) chlorine gas cylinders for raw water disinfection of the Navy's drinking water system. The use of chlorine gas at this facility has been discontinued since August 2013 as part of a mitigation plan to reduce high levels of disinfection by-products (DBP) in the Navy's drinking water system. Two chlorine gas cylinders secured with a diversion valve remain at the Reservoir Booster Pump Station (Building 1282) for back-up or emergency situations.\r\n\r\nLocated approximately 180 feet to the east of Building 1282 is Building 1284, a semi-enclosed, metal storage shed that holds twelve (12) full one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas, seventeen (17) empty one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas, and four (4) empty one-ton cylinders of anhydrous sulfur dioxide gas. In addition, there are five (5) 150 pound chlorine gas cylinders which are temporarily stored to be used at other Navy water wells.\r\n\r\nThe use of the one-ton chlorine gas cylinders at the Reservoir Booster Pump Station (Building 1282) has been discontinued since August 2013. Additionally, no further use of anhydrous sulfur dioxide is expect"

Only Buildings 1282 and 1284 exceed the respective 2,500-pound threshold limit for chlorine gas and require compliance with the CAA 122&reg; Risk Management Plan rule. All other Navy water wells have less than the 2,500 pound threshold of chlorine gas.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario.\r\n\r\nThe first worst case scenario (Worst Case ID 1) is for the potential failure of the two (2) interconnected chlorine gas cylinders at the Booster Pump Station (Building 1282) that could potentially release a maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine. These cylinders are housed within an enclosed structure and are equipped with automatic shutoff valves that would activate in the event of a leak and would further mitigate the potential release of chlorine gas to the surrounding environment. Specific equipment includes a gas leak detection system linked to mechanical vent and audible alarms.\r\n\r\nThe second worst case scenario (Worst Case ID 2) is for the adjacent chlorine gas storage area (Building 1284) and involves a potential release of a single cylinder maximum of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas. The chlorine gas cylinders are stored in a locked, unmanned, semi-enclosed, metal structure with no additional mitigation measures. \r\n\r\nEPA's RMP*Comp software was used to determine the effects of these potential releases. In both of the worst-case scenarios for Buildings 1282 and 1284, the calculated distance to a toxic endpoint is 1.30 miles. The resulting chlorine gas cloud will reach an end-point concentration off-site; however, both facilities are located within a restricted access military installation, and situated in a low valley elevation where there are no public receptors within the 1.3 mile radius.

Both are also unmanned and worker access to the sites is restricted to the daily site/facility visit/inspections and periodic preventive maintenance activities.\r\n\r\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nBased on EPA's General Guidance for Risk Management Programs, the covered processes at the Reservoir Booster Pump Station (Building 1282) and the Storage Shed facility (Building 1284) has demonstrated compliance with the Level 1 Prevention Program requirements in 40 CFR 68. \r\n\r\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo reportable accidental releases have occurred at this facility within the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n6. The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEmergency response procedures are incorporated within the NAVFAC Marianas Chlorine Gas Release Response Plan. Sulfur dioxide is no longer used in at the Apra Harbor Wastewater Treatment Plant and has been removed from the current response plan. This document designates responsibilities and contains detailed procedures for response, control, and mitigation of an accidental release.\r\n\r\n7.
