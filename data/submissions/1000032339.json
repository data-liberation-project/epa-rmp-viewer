As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1    PITMAN FARMS - SANGER POULTRY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n \n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry business practices\n\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nSanger Poultry operates a processing plant and freezer for poultry products that utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to provide refrigeration capacity to the following areas:\n\n?    Cooler\n\n?    Processing Room\n\n?    Blast Room 1-3\n\n?    Blast Room 4\n\n?    Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger\n\n\n\nThe system utilizes pumped liquid recirculators where high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid recirculator(s) through a liquid feed solenoid valve and an expansion valve.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into the evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through check valves and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. \n\n\n\nThe facility was built more than twenty five years ago, but since that time the following projects have occurred:\n\n?    May 2011 - Ice Makers were moved and a vertical liquid recirc package was installed outsid"

July 2012 - APCCO installed Blast Cooler #4 and a new high pressure receiver\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nPitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nPitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has had one (1) accidental release with"

California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n?    Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

Nevertheless, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nPitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Pitman Farms - Sanger Poultry will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
