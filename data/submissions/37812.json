      "SummaryText": "Munson Farm Center RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Munson Farm Center is engaged in the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies.  This facility was purchased from The Metamora Elevator Company in the spring of 1995. The facility manager is Doug Busdeker.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 2 \u00bd acres and is situated just north of the village of Munson in Medina Township, Lenawee County.  The facility is located on the east side Munson Highway, north of Lawrence Street and south of the Norfolk Southern Railroad Line. There is one residence to the south side of the facility, about 30 yards away.  There are no adjacent neighbors to the east.  There are a couple of homes on the north, about a \u00bc mile away.  To the southwest, there are 15 houses and one church within 500 yards of the facility.\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  A 16,500 gallon tank and a 30,000 gallon tank are used for bulk storage of  the material. These tanks are located approximately 50 feet and 65 feet, respectively, south of the railroad main line on the east side of the facility.  When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, these tanks can hold 39,525 total gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.  Ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and therefore an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a railcar or delivery truck to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the storage tanks to the small application tanks (aka \u00bfnurse wagons\u00bf).  Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the bulk storage tanks to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel pipes and are manually controlled.  Flexible hoses are used to connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons. \n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tanks can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank(s).  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \u00bfevents\u00bf are very short in duration \u00bf a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely, as indicated by the worst-case scenario.  The bulk storage tanks are built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tanks  are performed by certified welders.  \n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Munson Farm Center are:\n\u00bf  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a railcar or nurse wagon were to move before properly disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at a s"

At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Munson Farm Center are:\n\u00bf  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won\u00bft reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\u00bf  Back check valves are located on the railcar / truck unloading riser and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a railcar or truck from the storage tank.\n\u00bf  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel piping to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\u00bf  Emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n\u00bf  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tanks from 10,000 gallon and 15,000 gallon water tanks.  A nearby water well (120\u00bf away) could be utilized to provide water to knock down a vapor cloud.\n\u00bf  Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and dispos"
