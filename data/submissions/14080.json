Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis City of West Sacramento, Jefferson Pump Station, located at 601 Jefferson Boulevard in West Sacramento, Ca., handles chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of West Sacramento Jefferson Pump Station is designed to chlorinate the raw wastewater at the pump station before it is pumped to the main wastewater treatment plant located at 1991 South River Road.  Chlorine is delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier in one-ton containers for use at the Jefferson Pump Station. Off-loading of the one-ton container from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist. All the one-ton containers are placed in the chlorine storage area. One of the chlorine containers that are on-line is placed on the load-cell scale.  The other chlorine container is on stand-by.\n\nThe Jefferson Pump Station has administrative procedures in place to limit the amount of chlorine at the pump station, no more than 2 one-ton containers for a total of 4,000 pounds.  Delivery of chlorine one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The driveway provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of the delivery vehicles during the off-loading of the full one-ton containers and loading of the empty o"

No unauthorized personnel are allowed entry into the building.  A chain link security fencing and intrusion alarms the risk of vandalism and or sabotage of equipment. The container storage and handling is conducted pursuant to per Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.\n\nThe Jefferson Pump Station operates twenty-four hour per day, seven days per week.\nThe chlorine gas is withdrawn from the one-ton containers by vacuum.  This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the gas from the one-ton containers at a controlled feed rate set by the operators with the use of the rotometer at \n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPage 2 of 3\n\nthe chlorinator unit. The chlorine gas is injected into the feed water line, where it becomes a chlorine/ water solution and is feed where it is needed in the treatment process. The container storage building has inlet and outlet exhaust fans for fresh air entry and chlorine leak detectors which are connected to the telemetry system at the Main Treatment Plant.  In the event of a chlorine leak the alarm is activated and the operator at the Main Treatment Plant responds by notifying the appropriate agencies and personnel.\n\nThe vacuum regulators are vented to the outside. The pump station was designed and constructed for leak prevention, detection and containment according to state and federal guidelines. Automatic switchover units minimize connection/disconnection of the chlorine cylinders.\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substances are considered as part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe one ton (2,000 pounds) chlorine containers are the only size vessel used in the chlorine system located at the Jefferson Pump Station.  The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one ton chlorine container assumes that the full 2,000 pounds of "

      "SummaryText": "chlorine is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of  .0087 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is 1.3 miles.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for chlorine for the one ton container located at the Jefferson Pump Station assumes a release from a valve packing, resulting in an estimated release of no more than 2 pounds per hour.  The period of release is taken to be one hour in duration, resulting in a total release quantity of 2 pounds for each regulated substance. The distance to the endpoint of  .0087 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.1 mile.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine systems and the training provided to the operators.\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nPage 3 of 3\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents on"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of West Sacramento Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Yolo County Division of Environmental Health Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  \nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substances."
