Dyal Water Treatment Plant at 28400 E. SR 520, Christmas, Orange County, Florida.  This plant is one of two water plants operated by the City.  The Claude H. Dyal water plant and the Wewahootee water plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Claude H. Dyal Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City of Cocoa Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nThe City of Cocoa has a management system in place which is lead by the City Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.3.\tPREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\nThe City of Cocoa maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.

Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n1.5.\tSITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)\t\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Cocoa and managed by its Utilities Department.  The site is located at 28400 E. SR 520, Christmas, Orange County, Florida.   The 62 acre site is located in an area, boarded by SR 520 on the east, Taylor Creek Rd on the west, residences on the north and residences on the south.\nThe Plant includes a separate chlorine storage building and adjacent control room plus injection feed distribution system that is contained in a separate process room as well as at various injector points\u00bf cabinets.\n  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage Room, Feed Control room, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems, chlorine scrubber and chlorine injection cabinets at various injection points.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.5.1.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2500 pounds.

      "SummaryText": "is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 48 one ton containers.  This equals 96,000 pounds.\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system (see section 4 below: five year accident history).\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \u00bfworst case release\u00bf.  The second is a more probable \u00bfalternative release scenario\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\u00bf.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \u00bftoxic endpoint.\u00bf  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00bfmaximum"

Assumptions used were: \n\u00bf\tliquefied under pressure, \n\u00bf\tlb release, urban surroundings, \n\u00bf\tno mitigation measure.  \nResults demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles containing 5.3 square miles of area assuming an urban topography without an enclosure.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is one individual based on the U. S. Census 2000 demographic data.  There is one residence and industry included in that release area. The plant has observed four residences in the areas with about 27 individuals.\n2.2.\tALTERNATIVE CASE   (C) (2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the whip on pipes/valves connected to one of the one-ton containers.

The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor.  There are two sets of six ton containers on each high pressure line.  Each leads to an automatic switch over a vacuum pressure regulator. One bank is in service and the other is on standby. \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  There is a pressure relief valve which vents if the pressure in the line reaches above atmospheric pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  There is a chlorine monitor which detects the presence of chlorine in the ton storage area and a second monitor in the chlorine control room. \n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\nThe plant has been chlorine reportable and release free since 1992 to the present, 14 year.\n5.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (F)\nEmergency response procedures are contained both the Plant Emergency Response Policy and is coordinated with the Orange County Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response \u00bfdecision tree\u00bf and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the water plant Safety Committee, the County Police Department. The Water Plant and Fire Department coordinates with Local Orange County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Orange County HazMat Team.  All are located in Orange County, Florida.

      "SummaryText": "including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City water plant.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators. The primary response team includes the Orange County Fire and Rescue, and county Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to severe chlorine leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \u00bfB\u00bf Leak Repair Kit is maintained at the chlorine storage area to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the County Police and Sheriff\u00bfs Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n6.\tPERSONNEL (F) (1)\nPersonnel are the key resource of the City of Cocoa\u00bfs prevention program.
