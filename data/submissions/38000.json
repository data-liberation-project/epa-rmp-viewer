Dyal Water Treatment Plant at 28400 E. SR 520, Christmas, Orange County, Florida.  This plant is one of two water plants operated by the City.  The Claude H. Dyal water plant and the Wewahootee water plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Claude H. Dyal Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City of Cocoa Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nThe City of Cocoa has a management system in place which is lead by the City Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.3.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\nThe City of Cocoa maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Water Treatment Plant.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, p"

These are maintained City of Cocoa?s water plant Document Management System (DMS).\n1.4.    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT CITY OF COCOA, FLORIDA SITE (B)  \nThe City of Cocoa Water Treatment Plant employs 43 full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n1.5.    SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)    \nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Cocoa and managed by its Utilities Department.  The site is located at 28400 E. SR 520, Christmas, Orange County, Florida.   The 62 acre site is located in an area, boarded by SR 520 on the east, Taylor Creek Rd on the west, residences on the north and residences on the south.\nThe Plant includes a separate chlorine storage building and adjacent control room plus injection feed distribution system that is contained in a separate process room as well as at various injector points? cabinets.\n  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage Room, Feed Control room, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems, chlorine scrubber and chlorine injection cabinets at various injection points.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.5.1.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2500 pounds.  The City of Cocoa chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to 9 process control systems. \nChlorine "

      "SummaryText": "is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 48 one ton containers.  This equals 96,000 pounds.\n2.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system (see section 4 below: five year accident history).\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a ?worst case release?.  The second is a more probable ?alternative release scenario?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario?.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint.?  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum "

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\n2.1.    WORST CASE   (C) (1)\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA?s RMP Comp Program.  Assumptions used were: \n?    liquefied under pressure, \n?    lb release, urban surroundings, \n?    no mitigation measure.  \nResults demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles containing 5.3 square miles of area assuming an urban topography without an enclosure.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is one individual based on the U. S. Census 2000 demographic data.  There is one residence and industry included in that release area. The plant has observed four residences in the areas with about 27 individuals.\n2.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (C) (2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the whip on pipes/valves connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 0.03 square inch hole in the whip tube, a pipe, or even the container itself.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPA?s water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 67.0 lb. /minutes for a period of 30 minutes releasing a total of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\nThe City of Cocoa accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA?s PSM program and EPA?s RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for many years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall water division wide program and the Water Treatment Plant site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Orange County Fire/Rescue Department (including the Haz Mat Team) and the Regional LEPC.\n3.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (D) (1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\nThe City of Cocoa has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used. \nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \nIncident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident. \nEmployees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under emergency response. \nSafe work practices are used throughout the facility including:  1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock Out Tag Out Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical Li"

These include:\n3.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the chlorine process. \nCompletion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the modified chlorine system.   \nSpecific emergency response procedures for chlorine releases as outlined below under both operating procedures and in the emergency response procedures. See the Emergency Response Program book. \nSpecific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine. \nFinally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the chlorine system.\n3.2.3.    Facility Design\nThe chlorine storage area is housed in a closed building.  Its doors are closed and fenced. The plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and adjacent control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage and control building room is equipped with forced ventilation system.  There is a chlorine area monitor inside the storage building.  If chlorine is detected, the monitor alarms and shuts down the forced air ventilation system.  It also starts the building chlorine vent fume scrubber.  The scrubber is capable of neutralizing over 2000 pounds of chlorine.  The control room also has a chlorine monitor.  Both monitors alarm in their local area as well as in the water plant control room. \n3.2.4.
