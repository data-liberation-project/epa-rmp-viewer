      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Tadco Chemical Co. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Polyol Manufacturing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] and Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine].  Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is the reactant in our batch process.  Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] is the starter material reacted with Propylene oxide.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] at our facility is 186300 lb. while Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 41,000 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Propylene Oxide tank.  In this scenario 186,300 lb. of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is est"

These mitigation systems have the effect of containing an accidental release.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] involves a release from the Propylene oxide tank.  The scenario involves the release of 40180.74 lb. of Propylene oxide.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 74.04 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of containing an accidental release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L of Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] is 0.25 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] involves a release from the Ethylenediamine tank.  The scenario involves the release of 41,000 lb. of Ethylenediamine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 5325.77 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of containing an accidental release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg/L of Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine] is <0.06 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance w"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTadco Chemical Co. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 08/23/1996.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tadco Chemical Co. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTadco Chemical Co. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTadco Chemical Co. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Tadco Chemical Co. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 03/15/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Tadco Chemical Co..  The most recent review was performed on 5/15/96.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTadco Chemical Co. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 05/07/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nTadco Chemical Co. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nTadco Chemical Co. truly believes that proce"
