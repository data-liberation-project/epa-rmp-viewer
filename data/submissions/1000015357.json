The Orange Plant is an OSHA PSM regulated facility.  The elements of the Orange Plant\u00c2\u00bfs PSM program / OSHA PSM standard have been in place since 1992, which essentially mirror the prevention program requirement of the EPA's RMP standard.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe intent of employee participation is to ensure that Orange Plant employees are informed, consulted and involved in all aspects of process safety management.  Examples of employee participation range from reviewing Process Safety Information (PSI) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to serving on Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) teams.  \n\nThe Orange Plant also uses other processes such as company communication tools, Reinforcement Based Safety (RBS), and OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) to keep employees engaged and provide periodic reminders to the employees that their process safety concerns and suggestions are welcome.  \n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThe Orange plant compiles and maintains written process safety information to enable both the employer and employee to effectively identify and understand the hazards posed by the process.  Written PSI provides employees with baseline information to identify hazards of the chemicals used or produced in the process, information about the technology of the process, and information about the equipment in the process.  This PSI provides the foundation for performing the unit Process Hazards Analyses, developing operating procedures, and determining the applicability of management of change. \n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis is a systematic evaluation of all aspects of the process (equipment, chemicals, te"

Operating in a safe and environmentally protective manner are values held above all others.  The Orange Plant is focused on preventing process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, visitors, the community or the environment.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Program (RMP) demonstrates this focused commitment.  The PSM program involves the application of management systems and performance management practices to control process hazards through objectives, programs, procedures, audits, evaluations, and training that considers safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  \n\nSafety and environmental incidents are to be reported immediately and followed directly by an incident investigation which will develop the root causes and actions to be taken to avoid similar incidents in the future.  Investigations will be conducted with the objective of determining the causes and prevention of future incidents.\n\nThe knowledge that is gained from accident/incident reports, maintenance records, case histories, and trend analysis of incidents will provide basic information and potential changes that can be used to help further prevent catastrophic events.  As a tool to help manage this knowledge, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company has implemented a Knowledge Management System (KMS).  This corporate computer based system assists in tracking and sharing environmental, health and safety recommendations, changes and incidents.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP Orange Plant is located in Orange, Texas and operates two reactors to produce high density polyethylene (HDPE).\n\nThe HDPE manufac"

PHAs are performed on existing and new units in all of the Orange Plant\u00c2\u00bfs processes.  The Checklist and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), or other appropriate equivalent methodologies, were used to perform the PHAs on each covered process at the Orange plant.  A PHA results in action items (findings/recommendations) that identify and address perceived potential hazards.  The action items are prioritized for management and employee resolution using the scheme below:\n\nThe Orange Plant uses Layers of Protection Analysis methodology (commonly referred to as LOPA) to integrate process risk management into a unified, comprehensive program. \n\nIndependent Protection Layers (IPLs) are systems used to mitigate serious environmental and process safety risk, identified during the process hazard analysis.  IPLs include specific and identified standard operating procedures, alarms with operator response, safety instrumented systems, emergency shutdown systems, and protective devices. IPLs can be viewed as one of the first lines of defense against a potential incident by decreasing the likelihood of a potential incident.\n\nIPL Analysis provides the risk assessment methodology for the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is an integral part of the PSM program. If an action item arises from the analysis it will be managed and tracked to completion.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten standard operating procedures (SOP) provide clear instructions for the safe operation and control of the process and associated equipment.  SOPs are readily accessible to operations personnel in the control room and all other employees via an electronic delivery system.

The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity system include:  (1) design and construction requirements; (2) preventive maintenance practices; (3) testing and inspection; (4) repair, modification and alteration procedures; and (5) inspector and craftsman training and qualifications.  \n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Orange Plant has many safe work practices that promote worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) hot work permits to control work involving flame or spark-producing operations; (2) confined space entry permits to ensure adequate safety precautions have been taken prior to entering vessels, tanks and other confined spaces; (3) lockout/tagout procedures to guarantee isolation of energy sources prior to working on equipment; and (4) pressure-relief device (PRD) removal procedures to ensure adequate alternate relief paths are available prior to removal of any PRD and (5) interlock and alarm bypassing procedures to ensure that critical process controls are managed properly.  These procedures, along with others, form a system to help make certain that operations and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner.\n\n\nManagement of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\nThe Orange Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

Once qualified, each team member is expected to respond to emergency alarms while at work or if called out after their normal work shift.\n\nThe program consists of procedures for responding to various emergencies, including a small incidental emergency, plant-wide emergency, an external emergency, a hurricane or severe weather emergency, and a bomb threat.  The Incident Command System (ICS) is used to manage all emergency response situations.  The Orange Plant Emergency Response Team, a volunteer group of trained employees, responds to all plant emergencies to help minimize loss of life, property and to provide emergency medical care to the injured.  Trained Emergency Responders are onsite 24 hours per day.  \n\nThe Orange Plant is a member of the Orange County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee), SNC (Sabine Neches Chiefs), and STAN (Southeast Texas Alerting Network).\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nContinuous improvement in safety and environmental performance will be achieved through several practices including employee safety processes, Tenets of Operation guiding principles, Operational Excellence System, and other employee involvement programs.  Planned changes to improve safety at the Orange Plant are reviewed and adjusted annually. Improvements are also included in the yearly budgets and incorporated into the performance management systems / practices throughout the organizati"

This system requires that any change executed address the following: the technical basis for the proposed change; the impact of the change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  \n\nAffected process safety information (e.g., mechanical, electrical/instrument, chemical, and operating limits) and procedures (e.g., operating, maintenance, and safe work) are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\nThe Orange Plant conducts a Pre-startup Safety Review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. A PSSR is conducted for the following types of changes: equipment, facilities, and/or process chemicals, technology, and software. The PSSR serves as a final verification prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals into the process at a new facility and conducted prior to start-up, commissioning, or engagement of the change, for existing, modified facilities.  The PSSR must confirm the following: a PHA has been performed for new facilities and that PHA recommendations have been resolved; MOC requirements have been executed for changes to modified facilities; construction and equipment installation is in accordance with design specifications; training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed; and, safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate. \n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIncidents, which resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical, are investigated by a cross-section of plant personnel.

The full incident investigation report is available to any employee/contractor.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Orange Plant conducts compliance audits to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the PSM Program; to ensure that each program element complies with the standard; and to ascertain whether the elements from internal procedures and practices are adequate and are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team is comprised of a variety of disciplines who use a set of self-audit checklists based on the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP standards.  Audit findings and responses are entered and maintained in a computer-based tracking system.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe processes at the Orange Plant have hazards that must be managed to help ensure continued safe operation.  The Accident Prevention Program summarized previously is applied to all OSHA PSM / EPA RMP covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the Accident Prevention Program activities, the Orange Plant has safety features on many of its units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (i.e. mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection.\n\nRelease Containment/Control.\n\nPeriodic inspection of process equipment.\n\nInspections by Operators each shift.\n\nRou"
