It is Orange County's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for chlorine accidental release prevention and emergency response. Facility safety programs apply to all applicable OCU employees, as well as contractor employees working on-site.\r\n\r\nLike the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States, gaseous chlorine is used at the SWRF as a disinfectant to destroy pathogenic organisms in the treated water.  The popularity of chlorine as a wastewater disinfectant is mainly due to its effectiveness and ability to provide a low but measurable residual in the treated effluent.  \r\n\r\nOrange County's commitment at the SWRF is to store, handle and use chlorine in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and providing an emergency response capability to minimize consequences of a chlorine release, should a process accident ever occur. \r\n\r\nCompliance with all accidental chemical release prevention rules for Risk Management Planning (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) for the South Water Reclamation Facility is documented in the facility RMP/PSM filing system.  This documentation was prepared in conformance with both OSHA and EPA regulations, as well as industry-specific guidelines and best management practices relevant to chlorine systems operations and release prevention. South WRF's Plant Manager has the responsibility for ensuring that this program is implemented i"

      "SummaryText": "n the workplace as written.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nChlorine is received by the facility by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications.  Upon arrival at the site, all cylinders are thoroughly inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptly refused.  Once accepted, the chlorine cylinders are stored inside an enclosed building equipped with a chlorine detector that immediately notifies the operators of a release should a leak occur. Additionally, the building is equipped with a two chlorine gas scrubbers, each having a total capacity of one chlorine cylinder (2000 pounds).\r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release scenarios are based on chlorine releases from a cylinder in the enclosed storage building. The Worst Case scenario models the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine, one full cylinder. The duration of the release (10 min)is based upon EPA's RMP Program Guidance. Using RMP*Comp, modeling indicates a worst case scenario toxic endpoint at a radius of 0.9 miles. The estimated residential population within the distance to endpoint has been determined to be 2242, using MARPLOT Version 4.2.4, developed by EPA's Office of Emergency Management.  The front entrance to the wastewater treatment plant was used as the center of the estimated population circle of radius 0.9 miles.  This location was used, for both Worst Case and Alternative Release scenarios, to provide the most conservative estimate.  Although both releases would occur in the chlorine storage building, approximately 0.5 miles to the south, the populated areas are north of the access road (Sand Lake Road), which runs east-west on the north side of the facility. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is modeled on the failure of a lead washer releasing chlorine from a cylinder in the amount of 45 pounds.  This is indicative of a scenario more"

      "SummaryText": "likely to occur during normal operations.  The release rate (1 lb/min) is based on the time it would take to correct the problem (washer replacement) and the amount released.  The toxic endpoint, using RMP*Comp, was determined to be 0.1 miles.  Again using the front entrance to the facility and a radius of 0.1 miles, MARPLOT determined the estimated residential population within the distance to endpoint was 0 miles.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine in the past five years.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe South Water Reclamation Facility emergency response plan relies, primarily, on offsite assistance organizations, through coordination with the local fire department (Orange County Fire and Rescue). Emergency response plans at SWRF are based on the Incident Command system, with on-site personnel acting in first responder awareness and operations levels, only. The emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for post-evacuation employee accounting, notification procedures, rescue and medical duties, and response procedures for spills or leaks.  If a significant chlorine leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response team (fire department) for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community. Given that the facility has no emergency responders trained as hazardous materials technicians or hazardous materials specialists, only trained fire department personnel, donned in proper Personal Protective Equipment (respirators, suits, etc.) will enter the building, when a release should occur.  Facility personnel will then be allowed to enter the building for repairs, once the released chlorine has been contained, and only when such activities can be performed without the need for a respirator."
