The changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n- Updating the the RMP pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Section ? 68.190(b)(4) due to Stolthaven Houston Inc. commencing intermodal transfers of Pentane (n-), Isopentane, and a Pentane (>45%) / Isopentane (<55%) blend from rail cars directly into ISO tank containers with no intermediate product storage.  \n- Deleting 2-Methyl-1-Butene (CAS No. 563-46-2; Up to 16 percent of an Isoamylene mixture previously handled at the Stolthaven Houston Inc.) from the facility's current RMP. This covered chemical is no longer handled via intermodal transfers at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal, and can be removed from our current RMP.\n- Deleting Ethylenediamine (CAS No. 107-15-3; Up to 20 percent of the Crude Piperazine mixture previously handled via direct transfer from rail cars to marine vessels docked at Stolthaven Houston Inc.) from the facility's current RMP. This covered chemical is also no longer handled at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal, and can be removed from our current RMP.\n- Updating the name and contact information for Stolthaven Houston's current General Manager, who is responsible for 40 CFR Part 68 program implementation\n- Correcting certain minor program deficiencies noted since the most recent program audit\n\n\n?68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes involved in chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.

These products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo container that may include tank trucks, ISO tank containers, rail cars, barges, and/or marine parcel tankers (ships), are stored for a period of time per customer requirements, and then are subsequently transferred off-site through one of more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Direct transfer of TDI from marine vessels to rail tank cars is also performed at Stolthaven Houston Inc. with no intermdeiate storage of the product.\n\nBeginning in February of 2007, Stolthaven Houston Inc. will commence intermodal transfers of Pentane (n-), Isopentane, and a Pentane (>45%) / Isopentane (<55%) blend from rail tank cars directly into ISO tank containers.  Existing rail car and tank truck product transfer systems already in place at the terminal facility will be used for the referenced pentane transfers.

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls in place to ensure that we meet our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n?68.155(d):  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of the single accidental chemical release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five (5) years at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal which resulted in a recordable injury:\n\nOn the morning of August 21, 2002 an employee of a construction contractor working at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was sprayed with Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), a RMP covered chemical.  The incident occurred as the contract employee attempted to remove a blind flange located on a pump discharge line on the facility's TDI circulation system.  The construction company's foreman was verbally instructed by Stolthaven Houston personnel to remove only the insulation from the exterior of the TDI circulation piping in two locations so that an electrical contractor could later terminate the system's heat tracing; the blind flange in question should never have been removed.  Miscommunication between Stolthaven Houston Inc., the construction contractor's foreman, and the contractor's employee under the foreman's supervision was determined to be the root cause of this incident.\n\nThe blind flange had TDI product behind it that was acidentally released as the contract employee attempted to remove the flange from the system.  The affected individual was taken to the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's safety building where he was decontaminated in a safety shower.  The patient was placed on high flow oxygen and his vital signs were checked every 5 minutes until EMS arrived.  He was then transported to the East Houston Regional Medical Ce"

Due to the relatively small amount of TDI liquid released during the incident in question, and because TDI has an extremely low vapor pressure (0.0002 pound per square inch at 68? F) there were no off-site impacts from the referenced TDI release, and no environmental damage resulted from this incident as the release occurred in a primary contained area.\n\nAll incidents at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal are formally investigated as part of our facility's ISO Quality Management System to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the events and to implement appropriate corrective actions for continuous improvement.\n\n\n?68.155(e):  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting employees, the public, the environment, and company assets during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan and the North Channel Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is maintained which provides guidelines for responding to various emergencies such as fires, hazardous material spills, personal injuries, and property damage that may originate at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n\n?68.155(f):  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that are implemented at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal to prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n- PHA and adaptation of PHA recommenda"
