Baton Rouge Chemical Distributors manufactures and distributes high quality speciality chemicals used in water, water treatment and other process applications.  These products solve the problem of meeting increasing government regulations.\n\nThe Regulated substance at Baton Rouge Chemical Distributors is Chlorine.  Procedures and training are methods used in order to help prevent the accidental release of Chlorine.  Equipment is also maintained in good working order to insure compliance.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involved a release of fifty (50) lbs. Chlorine gas, at a release rate of 2.0 lbs/min, with the release duration being ten (10) minutes.  The projected wind speed was 3.0 m/sec with a .25 mile distance to endpoints which are businesses.\n\nThe alternative worst case release scenario involved a pipe leak.  In the event sixty (66) lbs. of Chlorine gas is released at a release rate of 2.0 lbs/min, with a release duration of 10 minutes.  The projected wind speed was 3.0 m/sec with a .25 mile distance to the endpoints which are businesses.\n\nThe active mitigation used is a TV monitoring system and a emergency shut-off system.  A study of Baton Rouge Chemical Distributor's Five Year Accident history indicates no accidental releases.  Emergency Response Plans have been put into place to assure that emergencies will be responded to in a timely manner that protects neighbors, employees and Property of Baton Rouge Chemical Distributors.  Baton Rouge Chemical Distributors will continue to stress safety in all aspects of the work process.  Existing training and more training wil be done to assure proficiency.\n\nBaton Rouge Chemical Distributors is committed to the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and its Responsible Distribution Process (RDP) and will constantly strive to be a market leader providing quality environmentally safe products and services"
