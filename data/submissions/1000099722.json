Our commitment to customer satisfaction is driven by accomplishing our objectives which include regulatory and customer requirements, continuously improving and the ongoing development of all team members including suppliers and contractors.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nSSI's Sintered Specialties Division is the world's largest stainless steel powder metal components manufacturing facility. We specialize in high-temperature sintering of stainless steel, soft magnetic alloy, tool steel, sinter-hardening alloy, and custom powder metal parts. We are unique in the Powder Metal industry with our ability to offer four metal process technologies. We serve a diverse range of applications in diverse industries - Automotive, Industrial, Medical, and Ordnance.\r\nThe facility is located on a nominal five acre site, with paved shipping and receiving areas. The major structures and their designated functions are:\r\nReceiving Area with docks;\r\nFurnace Room;\r\nWarehouse;\r\nShipping Area with docks;\r\nMaintenance Room;\r\nOffice areas;\r\n\r\nBulk liquid hydrogen storage tanks (2) and liquid nitrogen storage tank (1) located outdoors.\r\nThe regulated process consists of two bulk liquid hydrogen storage tanks (with a total maximum capacity of 13,000 pounds of hydrogen), two hydrogen vaporizers, and the piping and control system for distributing gaseous hydrogen to the various furnaces used to manufacture sintered powder metal parts. The hydrogen is used to maintain the proper atmosphere within the furnaces for manufacture of quality metal parts. Integral to the regulated hydrogen process is the liquid nitroge"

Safety features include redundant safety relief valves and rupture disks on the hydrogen storage tanks, a pressure control system on the tanks, multiple line pressure relieve valves, a line pressure regulating system, temperature controls, an excess flow valve, and an emergency stop button to rapidly close all pneumatic hydrogen valves. The liquid hydrogen storage system is continuously monitored by the supplier, Linde LLC, via telemetry. The furnace control systems include automatic hydrogen shutoff valves and nitrogen purge interlocks. The furnace building has an extensive ventilation system and a fire suppression system.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP Program) for its Hydrogen Process operation and maintenance. The PSM/RMP Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance. The bulk storage system is leased from Linde, LLC, who provides continuous monitoring of the system as well as periodic inspection and maintenance.\r\nAmong the many safety features present at the facility are:\r\nEPA Risk Management Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program;\r\nContinuous monitoring of the hydrogen storage tank systems via telemetry by Linde, LLC;\r\nRedundant safety relieve valves and rupture disks;\r\nHydrogen tank pressure control system;\r\nPiping system pressure relief and temperature control;\r\nExcess flow valve;\r\nEmergency stop;\r\nAutomatic hydrogen shutoff valves and nitrogen purge systems at the furnaces;\r\nBuilding ventilation and fire suppression system;\r\nEmergency communication systems;\r\nTraining Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others;\r\nPlant Safety Committee, trained,"

The plans address fire, explosions, spills or releases of hazardous substances, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies. The plans include procedures addressing incidents involving hydrogen.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the hydrogen process. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
