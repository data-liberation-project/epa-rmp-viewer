Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n-At this location we have field mounted fire alarm control systems which tie into the central control unit that will alarm and indicate the location of the problem.\n\n-Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant. They are maintained monthly and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor. \n\n- Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shutdown the Plant and isolate the process.   This location has multiple plant emergency trips located throughout the facility.\n\n-During plant emergency alarm conditions, this facility contacts BP refinery first responders.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThere were no releases of a regulated substance above its threshold quantity from the process in the previous five years.\n \nEmergency Response Programs:\n\nLinde has an emergency action plan in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances to employees, the public, and the environment.
