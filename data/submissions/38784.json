      "SummaryText": "CHLORINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (RMP)\nLEE COUNTY\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES\n\nGreen Meadows Water Treatment Plant (WTP)\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIntroduction\nThe Green Meadows Water Treatment Plant (WTP) treats water to potable drinking standards for Lee County.  The plant utilizes chlorine in order to disinfect the groundwater obtained from Lee County.  Since the WTP stores more than the threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs of chlorine onsite, the chlorination process is subject to USEPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations which are codified in 40CFR Part 68.  Chlorine is an easily liquefiable greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor that is listed by the USEPA as a regulated toxic substance for accidental release prevention.  Chlorine is a powerful disinfectant and can be safely utilized under regular plant conditions if handled appropriately with care.\n\nGreen Meadows WTP Chlorine Process\nLiquid chlorine is brought into the plant by trucks in 1-ton (2,000 lbs) pressurized containers from an outside vendor.  The containers are unloaded and stored in a covered open-air area prior to use.  Two banks of chlorine containers (one operating and one standby) are used to feed the vacuum chlorinators that comprise the chlorination system.  There are five containers connected to each bank.  The chlorination system is the all-vacuum type.  The chlorine gas that is contained under pressure in the storage containers is withdrawn by a vacuum regulator that is directly mounted on the container outlet.  The vacuum regulator reduces the chlorine gas pressure to a vacuum so that any damage to the chlorination system equipment or piping will typically result in air being drawn into the chlorination system rather than chlorine escaping to the outside air.  Chlorine gas is mixed under vacuum conditions with water by the chlorination equipment.  This chlorine solution is then piped to different application points in the WTP in order to disinfect the groundwater as part of the "

The RMP/PSM program includes periodic monitoring and continual evaluation of the RMP/PSM program elements being implemented at Green Meadows WTP.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Green Meadows WTP has an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program (codified in 29CFR Part 1910.119) for the chlorine process.  The scope of the PSM program encompasses various facets of accident release prevention, e.g., it has provisions for employee participation, increases employee awareness about the hazards of handling chlorine, establishes safe standard operating procedures and enhances access to process safety information.  In June 2004, the Green Meadows WTP updated the hazard and operability (HAZOP) process hazards analysis (PHA) on the chlorine system with the help of outside consultants in order to review existing operating procedures, equipment maintenance schedules, operational safeguards and identify some action items to render the process safer.  No urgent action items were identified; the Green Meadows WTP management has already initiated activities to implement recommended minor action items.  The written PSM program provides the procedural backbone for various safe operability functions (i.e., continual review of safe operating procedures, review of mechanical integrity of equipment, improved maintenance schedules, increased training, better access to process safety information and hazard awareness for both employees and onsite contractors, and effective emergency response planning), creates a paper trail of accountability, and thereby, allows the Green M"

      "SummaryText": "eadows WTP to maintain, review and evaluate the program on a periodic basis.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe Green Meadows WTP has had no accidental chlorine releases over the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nLee County has a comprehensive County-wide Emergency Response program that has been in force since March 1992.  The County's Hazardous Materials Emergency Plan defines the emergency response organization and responsibilities, notification actions, emergency communications, and protective actions.  Although this program involves many entities, responsibility for emergency response to releases of hazardous materials is given to the County Fire Department.  The Fire Department HAZMAT emergency response team is responsible for mitigating the effects of any chlorine leak at the facility.  The HAZMAT team regularly trains and has performed training for chlorine releases at water facilities.  County ER team members are regularly appraised, receive updated training and conduct practice emergency response drills on a scheduled basis.\n\nThe Green Meadows WTP has also developed evacuation procedures for the plant in the event of an accidental release of chlorine that requires notification of the County ER teams.  Evacuation procedures for both on-site employees and contractors are included in this plan.\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\nLee County and the Green Meadows WTP management and staff are committed to supporting the Process Safety Management (PSM) improvements to reduce likelihood of an accidental release and County emergency response (ER) organization and its prescribed functions in the event of an accidental release.  Ultimately, any safe operation is a grassroots movement that must be nurtured within the plant perimeter with the employees themselves.  The safe record of the facility in the use of chlorine and the safety improvements implemented as part of the PSM and RMP shows the commitment to safety that the County and the Green Meadows WTP management an"
