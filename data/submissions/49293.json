We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including: A. A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation. B. A summary of results from assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases. C. An overview of our accidental release prevention programs. D. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP Rule. E. An overview of our emergency response plan program. F. An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment. G. The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide. H. The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program. 2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES Our facility treats drinking water using a variety of chemicals in the process. We have a 24 Million Gallon per day Split Treatment Softening Plant which treats drinking water for the City of Jackson and surrounding communities. In our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a sustantial accidental release: Toxics We use chlorine for disinfection of potable water.Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are "

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: A. Process safety information B. Process hazard analysis C. Operating procedures D. Training E. Mechanical integrity F. Management of change H. Pre-startup review I. Compliance audits J. Incident investigation K. Employee participation L. Hot Work Permits M. Contractors As part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps: Preventive Maintenance with Daily, Weekly, and Monthly maintenance tasks and inspections. Employee Training with class room training, written test and on the job training. Written instructions for operation and maintenance of the chlorine system. We are in compliance with the Process Safety Management Rule. Chlorine ton tanks have Halogen Actuators that shut the tanks of if the chlorine leak detector detects a leak. We also have a US Filter Chlorine Scrubber that turns on and draws the gas out of the chlorine room if the chlorine leak detector alarms in which it is scrubbed with a 15% solution of sodium hydroxide converting it sosium chloride. These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The Water Treatment Plant is commited to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountibilities and controls to ensure that wee are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. 5.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY We have not had any significant accidental chemical "
