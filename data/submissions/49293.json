Our management system addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: Process safety information, Process hazard analysis, Operating procedures, Training, Mechanical integrity, Manage of change, Pre-startup review, Compliance audits, Incident investigation, Employee participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractors. As part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific steps: Preventive Maintenance with Daily, Weekly, and Monthly maintenance tasks and inspections. Employee Training with class room training, written test and on the job training. Written instructions for operation and maintenance of the chlorine system. We are in compliance with the Process Safety Management Rule. Halogen chlorinte ton tank valve actuators that shut the valves on the chlorine ton tanks when the alarm from chlorine detector alarms or the process operator pushes a button to actuate the valves. We also have a chlorine scrubber that turns on when the chlorine detector alarms and sucks the gas out of the room and mixes with sodium hydroxide to make sodium chloride. These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The Water Treatment Plant is committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.",
