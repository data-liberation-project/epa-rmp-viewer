The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge of 19,092 lbs which is over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00c2\u00bfs PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe top priority of Central Beef Industries LLC is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort Central Beef Industries LLC has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00c2\u00bfs (OSHA) PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management\u00c2\u00bfs Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \n\nIn the event of an emergency Central Beef Industries LLC will evacuate or shelter in place, depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, its employees and call Sumter County Fire Rescue to respond to the emergency.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nCentral Beef Industries LLC is a beef manufacturer located in Center Hill, Florida.  The manufacturing process includes refrigerated spaces and production equipment that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RE"
