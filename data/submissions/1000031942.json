      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Acetaldehyde Storage and Handling\n\nAcetaldehyde Storage and Handling\n\nAcetaldehyde is handled as a liquid cooled to 50?F (approximately 20?F below its boiling point) to minimize vapor generation and the subsequent potential fire hazard.  This sub-cooling is achieved by the use of the refrigerators within the facility.  Incoming drums for acetaldehyde are pressure rated and certified to the pressure rating required for the material.\n\nSecurity\n\nProcedural and physical security measures are in place to deter, detect and delay a threat.  The complete security plan is outlined and discussed in the Advanced Biotech Security Plan and is considered confidential.  Some highlights of the plan include: adequate illumination of the site; fencing to prevent unauthorized entry, secured gates on off hours; surveillance cameras; limited door/gate access; controlled access levels throughout the facility; etc.\n\nSummary of Security Plan\n\nThe facility is located on a roughly triangular property site.  Its perimeter is fenced on the South side, bordered by the Signac Brook (aka Nuachtpunk Creek) on the Northeast side and Amtrak Right-of-Way on the Northwest side.\n\nSite access security is maintained by a front gate which is locked during non-business hours.  Facility access security is maintained via locked exterior personnel and shipping/receiving overhead doors. Visitors are required to enter through the front entrance and sign in with the receptionist.  No unescorted visitors are permitted in the material storage, operations or production areas.  Delivery and shipment drivers check in with their respective loading docks for access to loading docks.\n\nThe Diesel Fuel storage tank and shipping and receiving areas employ continuous evening lighting activated automatically by photoelectric sensors.  This in combination with the fence serves to minimize the threat of vandalism in the tank area and the rest of the facility.  Lighting also allows for evening detection of s"

The camera surveillance is also recorded for later review as needed.\n\nSpill Prevention\n\nSpill prevention and abatement means utilized at ABT include verified leak-proof container closures and valves, secondary containment infrastructure in all areas of the facility as well as spill kits and absorbent materials at strategic locations.  The site operates with 'zero discharge' from Production, Pouring, QC Lab, Warehouse and Shipping/Receiving.  The site is considered a major facility by the NJDEP and as such has a Discharge Prevention Containment and Countermeasure and a Discharge Cleanup and Removal Plan approved August 5, 2013 and reauthorized August 8, 2016.\n\nHVAC and VOC Removal\n\nBuilding heating, cooling and ventilation systems are sized to provide the appropriate air flow and velocities necessary for the flammability class of Acetaldehyde.  Low point exhaust s are located throughout the facility due to its 1.52 vapor density (Air = 1.0).\n\nOver 30,000 CFM of air flow is provided as an exhaus"

A separate supplemental system is provided for the drum racks.  The sprinkler system is sourced from an on-site carbon steel 100,000 gallon firewater tank.  An additional 615 gallon tank contains a non-hazardous foam concentrate (Alcohol-Resistant Aqueous Film-Forming Foam) to improve the fire control and suppression capabilities of the sprinkler system.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies and Procedures\n\nAdvanced Biotech, Inc. (ABT) has made an Executive Management commitment to prevent and control spills and releases demonstrated by implementation of a comprehensive Discharge Prevention and Countermeasure Plan (DPCC) and Discharge Cleanup and Removal (DCR) Plan.  Substantial resources have addressed personnel training, accident/spill prevention and considerations for safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of equipment.  Advanced Biotech, Inc.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances for both worker and public safety.  The following operating procedures specifically apply to the covered Acetaldehyde process (Attachment 7-A):\n\nSOP   2 - Acetaldehyde Handling\n\nSOP 11 - Chemical Control\n\nSOP 46 - Mix and Fill\n\nSOP 47 - Mixing Production Operations\n\nSOP 55 - Products needing Ventilation\n\nSOP 62 - Refrigeration and Refrigerated Products\n\nSOP 79 - Acetaldehyde Blend Preparation\n\nSOP 80 - Acetaldehyde Blend Filtration for Shipment\n\nSOP 89 - Employee Participation Procedure (DPCC/DCR; PSM, RMP/TCPA)\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nABT is located on Taft Road in Totowa Borough, Passaic County, New Jersey and has one regulated substance, acetaldehyde.

The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP*Comp model was used to determine that the distance to toxic/flammable endpoint for such a release is less than 0.1 miles and does not affect any public or environmental receptors.  The storage facility is equipped with a tertiary containment to contain spills and prevent discharge to the environment. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nABT has developed a variety of technical documents that will be used to help maintain safe operation of the acetaldehyde operation.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). Chemical storage containers and handling equipment for acetaldehyde storage and operations have been selected for chemical/physical compatibility meeting DOT and IMDG requirements. \n\nABT has written procedures that address various phases of operations, such as receipt, inspection/testing, storage, dispensing, use and packing/shipping. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and maintained as current and accurate. \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for operations, Advanced Biotech, Inc. has implemented a specific training program for all employees potentially involved in working with acetaldehyde.  All training is been documented for each operator, supervisors verify that the operators understood th"
