This sub-cooling is achieved by the use of the refrigerators within the facility.  Incoming drums for acetaldehyde are pressure rated and certified to the pressure rating required for the material.\r\nSecurity\r\nProcedural and physical security measures are in place to deter, detect and delay a threat.  The complete security plan is outlined and discussed in the Advanced Biotech Security Plan and is considered confidential.  Some highlights of the plan include: adequate illumination of the site; fencing to prevent unauthorized entry, secured gates on off hours; surveillance cameras; limited door/gate access; controlled access levels throughout the facility; etc.\r\nSummary of Security Plan\r\nThe facility is located on a roughly triangular property site.  Its perimeter is fenced on the South side, bordered by the Signac Brook (aka Nuachtpunk Creek) on the Northeast side and Amtrak Right-of-Way on the Northwest side.\r\nSite access security is maintained by a front gate which is locked during non-business hours.  Facility access security is maintained via locked exterior personnel and shipping/receiving overhead doors. Visitors are required to enter through the front entrance and sign in with the receptionist.  No unescorted visitors are permitted in the material storage, operations or production areas.  Delivery and shipment drivers check in with their respective loading docks for access to loading docks.\r\nThe Diesel Fuel storage tank and shipping and receiving areas employ continuous evening lighting activated automatically by photoelectric sensors.  This in combination with the fence serves to minimize the threat of vandalism in the tank area and the rest of the facility.  Lighting also allows for evening detection of s"

Substantial resources have addressed personnel training, accident/spill prevention and considerations for safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of equipment.  Advanced Biotech, Inc.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances for both worker and public safety.

The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP*Comp model was used to determine that the distance to toxic/flammable endpoint for such a release is less than 0.1 miles and does not affect any public or environmental receptors.  The storage facility is equipped with a tertiary containment to contain spills and prevent discharge to the environment. \r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nABT has developed a variety of technical documents that will be used to help maintain safe operation of the acetaldehyde operation.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). Chemical storage containers and handling equipment for acetaldehyde storage and operations have been selected for chemical/physical compatibility meeting DOT and IMDG requirements. \r\nABT has written procedures that address various phases of operations, such as receipt, inspection/testing, storage, dispensing, use and packing/shipping. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
