If an emergency\n\nwere to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Nora Springs Fire Department (via 911 call) and request\n\nthat it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Cerro\n\nGordo County, Iowa Emergency Management Agency and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources will be\n\nmade.

In reality\n\nthe situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it was planned. In that event what may\n\nhave been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize\n\nhazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and\n\nunexpected release of chemicals (i.e., anhydrous ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or\n\nacts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for North Iowa Cooperative Elevator is Ed Paulus.

      "SummaryText": "CE HANDLED AT NORTH IOWA COOPERATIVE ELEVATOR:\n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is\n\nstored at this facility is distributed to agricultural producers in the surrounding area who utilize the\n\nanhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\n\n\nThe system consists of one (1) storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump, and other\n\nmiscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present\n\nat the site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).\n\nFull-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on this basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a\n\ntotal of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is three (3).\n\n\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed\n\n(85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud)\n\nform. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to endpoint is 3.3 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into\n\nthe storage tank without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's\n\nRMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.5 mile.\n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves,\n\nmanual shut-off valves, and remote emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks\n\nare protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose\n\nbreaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to Portland provisions have been designed to notify\n\nall affected persons."

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI\n\nStandard K61.1-1999 with amendments and state law.\n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an\n\naccidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nFinally, North Iowa Cooperative Elevator has extended to the Nora Springs Fire Department the opportunity to\n\nvisit our anhydrous ammonia facilities, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail\n\nthemselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nNorth Iowa Cooperative Elevator has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death,\n\ninjuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering-in-place.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is the policy of North Iowa Cooperative\n\nElevator to immediately notify the Nora Springs Fire Department and the Cerro Gordo County Emergency\n\nManagement Agency to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Nora Springs\n\nFire Department is unable to adequately respond to the emergency, the fire department(s) with whom\n\nNora Springs Fire Department has mutual aid agreements will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with\n\nthe fire department and the Cerro Gordo County Emergency Management Agency. Members of the fire\n\ndepartment and EMA have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our\n\nplant have been provided (for reference) to those entities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe plan is to minimize"

Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine\n\nobservations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel to\n\nthe nurse tanks. In so doing they are able to detect problems that are readily visible and easily identifiable\n\nbefore they arise. This routine inspection identifies external portions of the system which may be under\n\nstress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained\n\nto recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual\n\ntraining for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for\n\nnew hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up\n\nobservation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company\n\nroutinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department\n\nrequests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia the company cooperates fully in their\n\nendeavors.\n\n"
