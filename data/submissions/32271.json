The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Tri County Chemical, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient and also used for blending in a mixing operation to make mixed-grade fertilizers for application. \n\n3.  Worst-case scenario/Alternative- case scenario: Tri- County Chemical, Inc has developed a worst- case and alternative-case scenario however it has been whitheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n4.  Accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating  to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees.\n\n5.
