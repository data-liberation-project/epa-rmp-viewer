This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of the regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe facility is covered by the rule because it uses anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory threshold. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe updated report includes updated prevention program review dates and other activities associated with the prevention program. Cargill has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nCargill maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration process.\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficiently.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\nOperating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Cargill maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nCargill has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nCargill carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change (MOC) [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at Cargill to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at Cargill.

These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nCargill promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nCargill believes that PSM/RMP and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, Cargill employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nCargill has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process.\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87]\nCargill occasionally hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Cargill has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes.

Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies. Cargill also has personnel who are trained to respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. They receive training regularly, or more frequently at needed. The facility also utilizes the Parmer County LEPC to respond to chemical releases when necessary. Cargill has coordinated response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations on a regular basis. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nCargill is committed to improving our PSM and RMP programs. In an effort to continually improve our systems, Cargill has an internal process for reviewing all of our open recommendations from audits and PHAs. Additionally, all process changes regarding ammonia refrigeration are reviewed by the site management team prior to making any change. This provides expert review from each critical discipline, i.e. personnel safety, environmental, process safety, etc.\n\nCargill has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.
