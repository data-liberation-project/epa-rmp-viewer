      "SummaryText": "City of Lorain Black River Plant Executive Summary.\n     The Black River Wastewater plant is located on the mouth of the Black River in Lorain, Ohio.  It has a design capacity of 15MGD. Chlorine gas is the chosen method of disenfection and is fed from one-ton cylinders.  The chlorine room holds a total of four cylinders on two separate scales with a fifth capable of being stored between the two scales in use.  Up to four cylinders can be in use at one time.  There is a chlorine alarm in the room that sounds in case a leak develops.  Also there are automatic safety devices installed on the main valves to close the tanks in case of a leak and are also attached to a panic button.  Empty cylinders are stored outside after use.  No full containers are stored outside.  \n     Gaseous chlorine is fed from the ton cylinders under a vacume and mixed with water to form a strong hypochlorite solution.  It is then fed to two different feed points in the plant through an underground piping system system.  The vacume system lessons the chance of a leak.  As under a vacume air is likely to be drawn in rather than chlorine forced out.  Should a leak occur, operators are trained in the use of scott air packs and B-Kit training to stop a leak.  The Lorain Fire Department has held training here and are familiar with the facility.  They are the backup for the operators should something get out of hand.  Many members of the Lorain Police Department have been given tours of the facility as well as the Lorain Coast Guard.  It has been and continues to be our intention to give yearly updates to the associated safety forces as they aquire new personnel.\n     There have been no leaks of measurable quantity in the last five years here at the Black River Plant.  Minor leaks have all been handled by our own workers.  Chlorine equipment is overhauled at least once a year.  Chlorine euipment and feed rates are adjusted and monitored several times each shift.  The Chlorine room itself is kept locke"
