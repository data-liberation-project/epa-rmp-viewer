      "SummaryText": "     Backes & Toelke Agri Products, Inc is a retail fertilizer chemical outlet.  We are regarded as one of the leading Agricultural Retail Outlets in the Franklin County area.  We service a wide variety of farmers.  Most of the farms in our area also have livestock.  Therefore, most of the corn produced is feed locally.  It is very important that the corn raised in our area is produced at the most economical cost.   NH3 is the best source of nitrogen at the most economical price. 'When handled properly, NH3 can be applied with minimum risk.                                                                                                                                                                            All the equipment we use and let the farmers use is inspected and kept in very good condition on a regular basis.  when we are in season, the equipment is inspected weekly.  Prior to season, all equipment is gone over thoroughly by competent  professionals.  Any faulty equipment is discarded or repaired upon inspections. Due to quality equipment and safety precautions we have in place we have never experienced an accidental release of any kind.   Therefore, I feel like a worst case scenerio release is not very realistic. The alternative scenerio is more likely to occur but still very much controllable.  The owners and employees are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize ther impact of the release to our community and the environment.                                                                                                                                                              We have participated in the  Emergency Response Program-Commuinity right-to-know associated with the local authorities and the local LEPC.  Safety improvements is an on-going process a"
