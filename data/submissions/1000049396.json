Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy\r\n\r\nPembina Midstream is committed to protecting the health and safety of all individuals affected by our activities.  We are committed to safeguarding the environment and contributing to the well-being of the communities in which we operate.\r\n\r\nPembina works to continually improve our EHS performance by:\r\nA\u00bf\tIntegrating EHS best practices into all parts of our business.\r\nA\u00bf\tEnsuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards.\r\nA\u00bf\tIdentifying, assessing and managing EHS risk throughout our business.\r\nA\u00bf\tEnsuring that each employee, contractor and third party service provider understands their EHS responsibilities, is trained to meet them and is monitored for compliance.\r\nA\u00bf\tEstablishing EHS objectives and regularly measuring our progress.\r\nA\u00bf\tMaintaining Pembina Midstream's commitment to open and honest dialog with stakeholders\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe function of the Lynchburg Terminal is the wholesale distribution of propane.  The propane is normally delivered by rail tank car, stored in nine 30,000 gallon capacity vessels and is distributed by customers trucks.  The one substance regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is propane.  The quantities of propane stored in each 30,000 gallon vessel are controlled to 90% of their capacity to prevent overpressuring.  This procedure is backed up by a system to prevent pressure exceeding 250 psi, preventing structural damage to the vessels and also preventing an uncontrolled release.  Based on the aforesaid, the maximum inventory in storage at the site is 9 times 27,000 gallons or 241,000 gallons equivalent to 1,027,112 pounds of propane.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

Emergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nA written action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances and other incidents is maintained at the terminal.  The plan includes mitigating actions, medical treatment, evacuation, notification of responders, affected parties and public.  To ensure proper response an emergency response team is always in place and equipment regularly inspected/serviced.  The RMP is fully coordinated with the Campbell County LEPC and the local fire department.\r\n\r\nPembina Midstream will continually monitor the implementation of its RMP in order to prevent accidental releases of propane and will update the plan as new circumstances arise or new technology becomes available.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.

The following describes the details:\r\nA\u00bf\tWorse case scenario for Program 3 involves a catastrophic release from one of the 9-30,000 gallon tanks in the propane storage and involves the release of the entire content of the tank (27,000 gallons or 114,124 lbs).
