Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.                To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Russellville Distribution Center facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Russellville Distribution Center, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n \tThis facility is a distribution warehouse with a small rebox operation.\n \n \t Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility\n \n \tThere is currently approximately 11,200 lbs. Anhydrous Ammonia  in use at this facility\n \n  \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing  4,600  pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of  4,600 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 4,600 ft. before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\n\nAlternative release scenario i. - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia syste"

The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had no releases in the past 5 years of this type.\n\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations         Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n\tTyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  For chlorine systems Tyson Foods Inc. has adopted the Chlorine Institute guidelines for chlorine use. \n \n5.  Five-year accident history.\nOn Wednesday, July 6th 1994, while changing a solenoid valve, a small amount of NH3 (approx. 1 lb.) was released and pulled into a fresh air unit and into the building. There was 1 person taken to a local hospital and released. There was approximately 20 PPM of NH3 in the room when samples were taken.\n\n6.   The emergency response program.\t\nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Comma"
