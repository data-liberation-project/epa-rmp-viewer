This facility has mechanisms in place as identified in \"Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification / Procedures\" and \"Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"  to address releases of ammonia.  Designated facility personnel have received required OSHA training to respond to an ammonia release.  If an emergency were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThis facility is a poultry processing facility used to slaughter, cut-up, package, refrigerate and ship fresh poultry.  The facility receives live chickens which are slaughtered, processed and refrigerated for shipping to destinations in the region.  We use ammonia as a refrigerant in two (2) separate systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including drag freezers, evaporator units, water chillers, and ice makers.  The systems are identified as systems 1 and 2 and have maximum intended ammonia inventories of 33,737 and 20,263 pounds, respectively.  Thus, the total plant capacity is 54,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a pipe or vessel in ammonia refrigeration system 1 when it is operating with its maximum intended inventory of 33,737 pounds,  resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 200 ppm ammonia toxic endpoint is 17,800 feet and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a 1/4\" effective diameter orifice leak (re"

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site to a distance of 1,000 feet.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia refrigeration systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with IIAR codes and standards.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOn September 23, 2008 an incident occurred at the facility, resulting in the release of 36 lbs of ammonia gas. No fatalities or serious injuries were reported as a result of this release. Other than the previously mentioned incident, we have not had accidents involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in the five years prior to April 28, 2009.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to employ designated facility personnel to respond to the emergency.  Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in written plans entitled \"Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification / Procedures\" and \"Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\".  These personnel have received necessary response operations training in accordance with applicable OSHA regulations.  Designated personnel will also perform required external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Comission, Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the refrigeration systems."
