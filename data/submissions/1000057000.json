There is no physical address for the Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility.  The address of ETP's Waha Gas Plant is 2821 Waha Road, Coyanosa, TX 79730.  From Farm to Market Road (FM) 1450, go 0.5 mile south on FM 1776, then 1 mile west on Waha Road to arrive at the main entrance to the Waha Gas Plant.  To reach the Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility, drive west past the main entrance to the Waha Gas Plant on Waha Road.  Take the first left onto the private lease road just west of the Waha Gas Plant. Go 0.5 miles south to the gate into the Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of the Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility is bulk liquid storage and distribution of crude petroleum and petroleum products, including liquefied petroleum gas (NAICS 42471).  When the Centurion Pipeline L.P. (Occidental Petroleum Corporation) natural gas pipeline entering the Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility is being pigged to remove condensed liquid slugs, the equipment installed at the site is designed to safely separate and stabilize those liquids. A heated stabilizer column drives off remaining gas vapors (light ends) from the pipeline liquids.  The present rated capacity of the Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility is 4,000 barrels (168,000 gallons) of stabilized condensate.\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed a risk management program to address the EPA RMP requirements (40 CFR Part 68).  Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely processing and storing the covered chemical, propane & butane. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\r\n\r\nBari"

      "SummaryText": "lla Draw Slug Catcher Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the covered process.  Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nBarilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility handles intermittent pipeline liquid slugs (heavier hydrocarbons that have condensed from the pressurized natural gas in a pipeline).  Thus, there are hazardous substances (flammable liquids) that are utilized in or generated by the process.\r\n \r\nBased on the EPA definitions of flammable hydrocarbons, the quantities of the regulated flammable mixture in processing areas as well as in storage tanks at the facility consists of a total of approximately 785,000 lbs. of the flammable mixture.  The facility has designated this bulk liquid handling, storage & distribution activity as one Covered Process described below.\r\n \r\nBulk Petroleum Product Storage & Distribution (Stabilized Condensate/LPG)\r\nThe Barilla Draw Facility safely separates liquid slugs that enter the site from a buried natural gas pipeline.  The separated pipeline liquids are routed to a heated stabilizer column where any remaining gas vapors (light ends) are driven off, compressed and returned to the pipeline.  The stabilized condensate (hydrocarbon liquids) are routed to horizontal bullet storage tanks.  The bulk liquids are loaded into tank trucks for transport to refineries/fractionation plants or blending terminals.  Personnel from the Operator, Kinder Morgan Treating, are present at all times during the day when truck loading operations are underway in the Barilla Draw Facility.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary for Toxics"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment - Flammables documentation behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Submittal Binder located at the facility. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary for Flammables\r\nScenario Description: One realistic alternative release scenario was modeled which considered a leak through a failed relief valve on a single Stabilized Liquid Storage Tank (TK-1303/4/5/6/7/8/9).  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment - Flammables documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Submittal Binder located at the facility. \r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough bulk petroleum and petroleum product storage and distribution facilities (including those handling liquefied petroleum gases [LPG]) have inherent potential risks, and under a worst-case release scenario combustible vapors could potentially reach equipment in the adjacent manned ETP Waha Gas Plant, the Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs and equipment spacing and layout to prevent and mitigate low probability-high consequence events, i.e., render the worst case incident as non-credible. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated w"

Thus, Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility has an Emergency Response Plan in place and also submits appropriate documentation in regards to hazardous chemicals and associated quantities as to be included in the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe planned changes to improve safety at the Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility resolve the recommendations derived from the Process Hazard Analysis, as well as incorporate recommendations from Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations, as they become available.  The Barilla Draw Slug Catcher Facility has employed a tracking system for implementing these recommendations and ensuring their closure.  As required by the regulations, recommendations will be addressed and closed in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nDuring the PHA for each system, a broad list of external events and human factors was considered by the Team.  General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of stabilized or unstabilized condensate were evaluated.  The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, tornado, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, and vehicle impact."
