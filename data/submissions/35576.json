This facility is known as the Mobile Plant.\n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (? 68.155(a)):\n\nOxyChem has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Mobile Plant facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Mobile Plant.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (? 68.155(b)):\n\nThe OxyChem Mobile Plant handles only one regulated substance that is covered by the RMP rule.  This substance is as follows:\n\nList of Chemical Substances:\nChlorine\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (? 68.155(d)):\n\nThe OxyChem Mobile Plant's prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The Program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information         Process Hazard Analysis            Operating Procedures\nTraining                                       Mechanical Integrity                    Management of Chang"

These manuals are routinely updated.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History (? 68.155(e)):\n\nThere were no RMP accidents at this facility in the past five years. \n\n\nEmergency Response Program (? 68.155(f)).\n\nThe OxyChem Mobile Plant has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (ECC).  In addition, the OxyChem Mobile Plant has developed a Special Situations Plan (SSP) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThis facility is a member and participant of the Greater Mobile Emergency Planning Committee (GMEPC) which includes industrial and public entities.\n \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (? 68.155(g)).\n\nThe OxyChem Mobile Plant constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n \n\nCertification Statement \n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\nOriginal on Cover Letter  "
