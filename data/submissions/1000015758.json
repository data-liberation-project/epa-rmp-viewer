      "SummaryText": "I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA.  BACKGROUND\n\nThe United States Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments in November 1990.  Section 112R of the Act requires facilities to implement measures to prevent accidental releases of contaminants into the atmosphere and to minimize the consequences of any release. These amendments were a part of a continuing effort to prevent accidental releases of toxic chemicals and minimize damage to human health and the environment.\n\nThe Act required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prepare a list of substances with their toxic threshold, and develop rules for a risk management program. It required a facility to identify hazards from potential releases, design and maintain a safe facility, and minimize the consequences of a release:\n\nIn response, the Environmental Protection Agency completed the following actions:\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tprovided a proposed list of substances on January 19, 1993\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tpublished the proposed Risk Management Rule on October 20, 1993\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tpromulgated the Risk Management Rule on June 20, 1996; and\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\trequired development and implementation of a Risk Management Program.\n\nThe Risk Management Rule requires all applicable facilities to prepare a Risk Management Program (RM Program) by June 21, 1999 and implement it on an on-going basis. The Risk Management Program includes:\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tregistration of the facility with the EPA\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tcompletion of a hazard assessment of the facility\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tdevelopment of a prevention plan to reduce the probability of releases\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tdevelopment of a response plan for implementation in the event of a release, and\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tsubmission of a summary of the RM Program (the Risk Management Plan) to the EPA\n\nB.  APPLICABILITY\n\nThe City of Durant\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Water Treatment Plant (WTP) utilizes numerous chemicals in order to supply a safe (free of bacteria) and reliable source of potable water to the citizens of Durant.  Of those chemicals, only chlorine is utilized in a process in quantities greater than the threshold qu"

      "SummaryText": "antity defined in the regulations. \n\nChlorine is used to disinfect our water and make it safe to drink. At the Durant WTP, chlorine is delivered and stored in cylinders with each container holding a net weight of one-ton or 2000 pounds.  In accordance with our standard operating procedures, no more than five (5) one-ton cylinders are on site at any time. Thus the maximum quantity of chlorine utilized or stored at the site at any one time is 10,000 pounds.  This exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds for chlorine; therefore, the requirements of the Risk Management Rule are applicable to the Durant WTP.\n\n\nC.  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe City of Durant desires to protect the public health by providing a safe water supply in sufficient quantities to meet fire protection needs and satisfy the demands of the users of our water distribution system. We must strive to maintain a balance between the risks associated with chlorine use and the risks associated with consuming contaminated water.  The benefits of providing a pathogen-free water supply exceed the risks associated with chlorine usage in a properly operated WTP.\n\nIt is important to understand that chlorine may present a hazard to the public health if utilized in an uncontrolled manner. Chlorine and numerous other chemicals exhibit acute toxicity at certain levels of exposure.  The probability of experiencing toxic levels of exposure at a properly operated WTP is small. However, the consequence of exposure to toxic levels of chlorine is extreme and can result in loss of life. \n\nSince chlorine is used in our disinfection process, the goal of the RM Program is to provide a management system that reduces the risk of injury or death (to our employees and to the public) as a result of an accidental release of this chemical. We can manage the risks associated with the use of chlorine by taking a proactive approach to its use. \n\nThe City of Durant WTP RM Program includes a Prevention Program and an Emergency Response"

The worst case release scenario for the Durant WTP assumes the release of the entire contents of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder in a ten-minute period. Thus, the release rate is 200 pounds per minute for a ten-minute duration period. An example of how this release might occur is damage to the cylinder during unloading at the WTP.\n\nUsing EPA RMP*Comp Version 1.07 the toxic end point for the above chlorine release is 1.3 miles.  Thus, a circle with a radius of 1.3 miles is drawn around the WTP to account for any possible wind direction. Under this scenario, approximately 3,000 persons in residential structures have a potential to experience a concentration below which all individuals could be exposed for one hour without experiencing health effects that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nAlternative More Realistic Scenario\n\nThe regulations require an assessment of at least one alternative release scenario.  Staff reviewed historic release data and developed several release scenarios that have a more probable, realistic chance of occurring at the WTP.  Plant personnel can effectively handle these release scenarios. However, none of these scenarios caused an off-site release of chlorine. Thus, another set of alternative scenarios were developed. \n\n* Alternative More Realistic Scenario: It was assumed that the entire contents of the 1-ton chlorine cylinder were released as a liquid through the 5/16-inch diameter opening in cylinder valve.  This could occur if a heavy object was dropped shearing the valve. The release rate is 241 pounds of liquid chlorine per minute for a duration period of about 8.3 minutes.
