The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for 3 different programs of compliance dependent upon the eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical releases as identified in the hazard assessment.  For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.  \n\n\n\nAt General Chemical Delaware Valley Works, five listed chemicals are managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on-site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. The chemicals managed according to program level 3 criteria include Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Oleum, Methyl Chloride and liquid Sulfur Dioxide.  Liquid Sulfur Dioxide is used sparingly and is not maintained on-site at all times.   Because liquid Sulfur Dioxide is not currently managed on-site, but may be during the next five years, General Chemical is filing a predictive RMP for future use of liquid Sulfur Dioxide. "

      "SummaryText": " As identified in this plan, Delaware Valley Works is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for management of liquid Sulfur Dioxide, Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Oleum and Methyl Chloride.\n\n\n\nThis RMP describes Delaware Valley Work's risk management program which includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response program. The hazard assessment includes one worst case release scenario and five alternative case release scenarios. The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B (68.20-68.42), as well as the USEPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.  The release prevention and emergency response programs at this site were developed based on requirements of the CAA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the Delaware Extremely Hazardous Substances Regulation.\n\n\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G (68.150-68.190), which provides a format for a written RMP.  The required elements of an RMP, as defined by the USEPA, are listed below along with the section in which they are located in this RMP.

General Chemical Corporation is committed to implementing policies and procedures which ensure that its operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Achieving responsible health, safety and environmental management will be accomplished by: operating our facilities safely and prudently; efficiently using energy and materials; seeking ways to minimize or reuse wastes; and otherwise complying fully with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Delaware Valley Works has prepared employees, in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a release. \n\n\n\n2.0    Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nGeneral Chemical's Delaware Valley Works is a complex operation that manufactures specialty and industrial chemicals.  These products include sulfur-based chemicals, fluoborates, sulfuric acid, and other specialty products.  Delaware Valley Works occupies 130 acres on the lower Delaware River.  It is divided into North and South portions by Philadelphia Pike.  The North Plant contains batch reactors used to make specialty chemical products.  The South Plant houses the sulfuric acid plant and units for making photo salt products.  Support facilities at the plant includes warehouse space, product packaging line, loading and unloading facilities for trucks, and railcars.  The plant also contains its own product testing laboratory, as well as research and development facilities. \n\n\n\nNine production processes at Delaware Valley Works use one or more of the regulated chemicals identified above.  The processes, and associated regulated chemical(s) are outlined below:\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess - Potassium Nitrite Production\n\nRegulated Chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nUse - Raw material\n\nQuantity stored per p"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n\n\n3.1    Worst Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by the USEPA is a hypothetical accident for one of the chemicals at a site.  It assumes that all safety systems in the facility simultaneously fails and that all of the chemical in the largest container holding it at a site is released in a very short time. A USEPA-designated table defines the distance the material will travel until it disperses so much that it is no longer hazardous.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario at General Chemical's Delaware Valley Works assumes that a rail car containing liquid Sulfur Dioxide fails. The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems fail, and the contents are released in 10 minutes.  The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 16 miles before it reaches a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n\n\n3.2    Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe alternative case scenario is a more credible hypothetical, site-specific chemical release. It takes into account safety and release prevention systems and procedures used at the plant to control releases. It is more realistic than the worst case scenario; is calculated from a USEPA-designated table; and, is used to plan a facility's emergency response to accidents. \n\n\n\n3.2.1    The alternative case release scenario for liquid Sulfur Dioxide at Delaware Valley Works assumes liquid Sulfur D"

It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release. The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 0.25 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 The alternative case release scenario for Methyl Chloride at Delaware Valley Works assumes Methyl Chloride would be lost due to failure of a Spent Acid unloading hose during the transfer process. It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release. The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 0.10 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration.\n\n\n\n3.2.5    The alternative case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia at Delaware Valley Works assumes Anhydrous Ammonia would be lost due to the failure of an unloading hose during the transfer process.

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Delaware County (PA) and New Castle County (DE) Local Emergency Planning Commissions (LEPCs).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committees which are comprised of local government officials, local emergency response officials, and industry representatives.  Delaware Valley Works, the LEPCs and the local fire departments have coordinated communication to notify the public quickly, if necessary, as well as facilitate quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic committee meetings, Delaware Valley Works conducts periodic emergency response drills that involve emergency response organizations.    \n\n\n\n\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nDelaware Valley Works performs periodic process hazard analysis to evaluate and to strive continuously to improve health, safety and environmental performance as technical developments, scientific understanding, consumer and community needs, and regulatory requirements evolve and change, some of which result in process modifications.
