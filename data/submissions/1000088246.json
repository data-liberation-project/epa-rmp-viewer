      "SummaryText": "(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:    \n\nThird Coast Terminals (TCT) is deeply committed to the prevention of environmental pollution, conservation of resources and to observe all applicable legal and moral requirements that apply to all our work operations. Third Coast Terminals (TCT) has implemented policies and procedures at the Pearland facility with a commitment for accident prevention and safety.  TCT provides safety rules, practices, and procedures to help prevent accidents and to respond to incidents.  TCT strives for a record of zero accidents.\n\n\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThird Coast Terminals (TCT) is a specialized storage, toll processing, contract blending and drumming operation serving the Global Petrochemical Industry.  TCT handles two different toxic chemicals above threshold values for the RMP program.  TCT handles Toluene Diisocyanate mixed isomers in storage tanks, and in bulk shipping containers.  TCT also handles Isopropylamine in bulk shipping containers.\n\n\n\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThird Coast Terminals has implemented the aspects of the EPA RMP program level 2 for Toluene Diisocyanates.  Toluene Diisocyanates is received in bulk shipping containers and transferred to storage tanks for later use in blending operations. The systems in place include specific batch process procedures, transfer procedures, and storage monitoring programs.  Only trained employees are allowed to operate Toluene Diisocyanate equipment.  \n\nThird Coast Terminals has also implemented the aspects of the EPA RMP program level 3 for Isopropylamine.  The process uses more than 10,000 lbs of Methanol as a solvent (Fp = 54?F) and is subject to OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and thus, making this a Program Level 3. Isopropylamine, which is used as a reactant (is consumed during the reactio"

The process that utilizes Isopropylamine has implemented all aspects of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP program elements.  The system has specific procedures, maintenance checks, and requires dedicated personnel to monitor the equipment while Isopropylamine is present.\n\n\n\n(d) The five-year accident history:\n\nThird Coast Terminals (TCT) has not had an accidental release of Toluene Diisocyanate mixed isomers nor Isopropylamine in the last five years greater than the reportable quantity. The Isopropylamine process is expected to start mid July 2020.\n\n\n\n(e) The emergency response program: \n\nThird Coast Terminals (TCT) has established mutual aid system of emergency response that is coordinated with local and county emergency response agencies.  On-site personnel are trained to identify emergency situations, respond to specific emergencies within their personal training level, and implement the emergency action plan for response, if required.  TCT has prepared our organization for rapid response, recuperation, community assistance, and business continuity.\n\n\n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety:   \n\nThrough the TCT ongoing implementation of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP programs, TCT looks continuously for possible system changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n"
