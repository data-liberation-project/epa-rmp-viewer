USEPA requires companies to use models for \u00bfworst-case\u00bf and \u00bfalternate\u00bf release scenarios for each regulated chemical.  Given the safety precautions at the facility, both scenarios are unlikely to occur. If a release occurred, however, the alternative scenario would be more likely.  \n\n\tThe ammonia release scenario was modeled using SLAB (June 1990 version) to obtain the distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint.   The Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2, ERPG-2, was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  It refers to the level of ammonia that individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without being subjected to irreversible or other serious health effects that could make it difficult for them to leave the affected area.\n\n\n4.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\tThis facility is regulated under PSM and has developed an OSHA PSM program \tfor their ammonia refrigeration system.Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 \tprevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.\n\t\n\tThere are several key aspects of the prevention program:\n\n1.\tIn order to protect piping and evaporators from being impacted by heavy machinery or facility personnel the piping and evaporators have been located on the roof of the facility.\n\n2.\tThe facility maintains good training and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n3.\tThe ammonia system is a new installation that places the compressor room in an isolated area, which is controlled by state of the art warning and control devices.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n\n1.0\tRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Columbus Ohio, has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia). This facility is implementing an electronic preventive maintenance system. This system uses a real time database to track preventive maintenance, training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\nThe emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Hamilton Township  Fire Department), in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substances\nKraft distributes Kraft food products at the Columbus Ohio facility.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 49312.   Kraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the Columbus, Ohio plant \u00bf ammonia. The storage area of the plant is refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately  18,104 pounds.\n\n\tAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989. Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities. Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause  burns. The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and oth"
