The facility maintains emergency equipment to use in the event or a fire or release (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), spill control equipment). The Reece City Volunteer Fire Department, Etowah County Sheriff's Department, and Gadsden Regional Medical Center are part of the emergency response plans for the facility and have been provided copies of the facility's contingency plan.\r\n\r\n(f) The facility provides refresher employee training regularly that incorporates safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response. The facility also performs monthly safety meetings on various topics taken from suggestions provided by facility employees to improve general site safety and RMP-constituent safety procedures.  With respect to RMP chemical handling, the facility attempts to actively manage the processing of these chemicals such that the volume of the chemicals is below the RMP threshold quantities. In the event that the facility receives the chemicals listed above in quantities greater than the RMP thresholds, the facility attempts to manage the chemicals such that the volume of the chemicals is reduced and removed from the site expeditiously."

Waste material is generally received and shipped by the facility via tank truck, box truck, and railcar.\r\n\r\n(a) The facility is committed to the safety of its employees and neighboring community. Facility personnel receive training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response as provided in the facility's RCRA permit. Topics discussed to prevent hazards include: site access, inspections, location and operation of emergency response equipment, utilization of existing safety measure (e.g., berms, containment), and the handling of incompatible wastes. Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and spills; the Reece City Volunteer Fire Department is the primary responder in the event of a release beyond the incipient stage.\r\n\r\n(b) The facility consists of a liquids waste fuel Tank Farm/Drum Processing process, a liquid/solid waste storage/processing area, an aerosol can recycling process (including an aerosol can crushing system and associated liquid and gaseous content storage tanks/processing equipment), an aerosol can storage area (Kruncher Warehouse), a Railcar Loading process, a Tanker/Roll-off Container Storage process, and a drum re-conditioning operation. The Tank Farm/Drum Processing process consists of eight 20,000 gallon storage tanks and two 11,700 gallon tanks that are interconnected with piping to the drum processing equipment. The regulated substances potentially handled above their regulated threshold levels in the Tank Farm/Drum Processing process include: Acrylonitrile; Allyl Alcohol; Carbon Disulfide; Chloroform; and Vinyl Acetate Monomer.  The regulated substances potentially handled above their regulated threshold levels in the Tanker/Roll-off Container Storage process include: Acrylonitrile; Carbon Disulfide; Chlorofo"
