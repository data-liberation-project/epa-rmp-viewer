(QCWI) is a multinational wholesale distributor of chemical products.  As of the date of this submission, the Company operates seven distribution warehouses in the United States; only a few of these facilities are subject to Risk Management Program Planning.  This summary describes QCWI's Risk Management Program for its Fairbanks, Alaska facility.\n\n\n\nI.  Statement of Senior Management Commitment to Safety\n\n\n\nQCWI's President has adopted a policy on \"Health, Safety and the Environment\". This policy is the first policy adopted in QCI's Operations Manual, and sets the foundation for all subsequent policies.  It clearly places the protection of the environment, and the health and safety of employees, as the highest priority of the company. \n\n\n\nQCWI has specifically authorized designated facility emergency coordinators to commit any resources necessary to control an incident.  This includes mobilization of other emergency response organizations as well as the purchase of necessary supplies and equipment.\n\n\n\nII.  General Facility Description\n\n\n\nQCWI Fairbanks is situated within an industrial area just outside Fairbanks' city limits.  The surrounding area is sparsely populated with the nearest residence being approximately one mile away.  There are no at-risk populations (e.g., schools, nursing homes, day-care centers, hospitals, prisons, etc.) located within one mile of the facility.  The closest environmentally sensitive area is the Chena River.  The QCWI Fairbanks facility coordinates emergency planning and response with the Fairbanks University Fire Department, and the Fairbanks North Star Borough.\n\n\n\nA.  Description of Primary Activities at Facility\n\n\n\nQCWI Fairbanks is a warehousing and distribution facility that also packages and blends chemical products.  Chemical products are received, stored and delivered to customers in closed containers, or in bulk "

Description of Facility Processes\n\n\n\nQCWI Fairbanks engages in the following activities:\n\n\n\n-- Delivery by flatbed trailer of chlorine and sulfur dioxide tonners \n\n-- Manufacturing of chemical blends\n\n-- Receiving/delivery by cargo tanker truck, rail cars and ISOtainers of chemical products in bulk\n\n-- Delivery of chemical product in non-bulk UN-approved containers\n\n-- Internal movement of chemical products from the receiving area by forklift or pallet jack to and from the designated storage area\n\n-- Delivery of chemical products to customers\n\n-- Packaging of salt\n\n-- Cement blending\n\n\n\nC.  Description of Products/Quantities Handled at Facility\n\n\n\nQCWI Fairbanks may store two CAA 112 RMP program chemicals, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, in amounts that exceed threshold quantities.  The largest containers of chlorine gas and anhydrous sulfur dioxide that might be stored at the facility are one-ton containers, although 150 pound cylinders are stored as well.\n\n \n\nIII.  Worst Case Release Scenarios/Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThis section summarizes the worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios presented in the QCWI - Fairbanks RMP plan. \n\n\n\nA.  Worst Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for QCWI Fairbanks is a release of a one-ton container of anhydrous sulfur dioxide gas.  A release of this magnitude would impact receptors within a 3.1-mile radius (as determined by RMP*Comp).  The Company believes that this release scenario is extremely unlikely given the inherent integrity of containers used for sulfur dioxide.  Sulfur dioxide one-ton containers are manufactured to meet stringent U.S. Department of Transportation standards.  These container standards are specifically designed to minimize (if not eliminate) the possibility of accidental release during the rigors of transportation in commerce.  Manufacturing specifications include the use of >1-inch thick steel for the body of the container.\n\n\n\nContainer weigh"

This factor, by itself, makes the possibility of a release (during onsite movement) of a quantity greater than a one-ton container extremely remote.  Container valves are protected within a recessed compartment to prevent accidental damage during handling/transportation.  \n\n\n\nQCWI Fairbanks stores chlorine, and sulfur dioxide containers outdoors in a stationary storage van, when space permits, to provide protection from weather/temperature.  The storage van is not located in an area subject to major traffic. \n\n\n\nB.  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\n1.  Chlorine Gas\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario at QCWI Fairbanks is the accidental release of five pounds per minute for a duration of one hour of chlorine gas from a one-ton container.\n\n\n\nRelease of Chlorine:  Because of the inherent integrity of the container itself, only the valve and fusible plug present feasible release scenarios.  As explained above, the valve is recessed inside the container and damage could only occur if an object enters the recessed area with sufficient force to damage the valve.  The fusible plug is designed to begin to melt at approximately 157? F.  If the fusible plug melts as a result of fire, it is expected that the chlorine would be entirely consumed by the fire.  The Company has requested information from the Chlorine Institute that would allow us to estimate the worst case release-rate from a melted fusible plug.  The Chlorine Institute responded that there were too many variables (e.g., temperature during the release) to make a reasonable estimate of the release rate.\n\n\n\nThe estimate of the quantity released (300 pounds) is based on the assumption that containment kits will be applied within one hour (active mitigation).

Rules and Regulations that Apply to this Facility\n\n\n\nSeveral-hundred federal, state and local environmental and safety rules and regulations apply to this facility; it is not possible to summarize all of the regulatory requirements in this document.  The primary legislation affecting chlorine is OSHA's Process Safety Management rule.  A chlorine PSM program has been implemented at the Fairbanks branch.   The Fairbanks University Fire Department performs site inspections.  The Uniform Fire Code and related building codes also apply to this facility and are monitored by the University Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe Company has a formal safety training program designed to meet training requirements promulgated by OSHA, DOT and EPA.  Hazard communication training (OSHA) is the primary method the Company uses to educate employees on the risks associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  \n\n\n\nB.  Internal (Company) Release Prevention Program Requirements\n\n\n\nQCWI is a subsidiary of Quadra Chemicals, Inc, which is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  It is actively engaged in the process of becoming certified under the NACD's \"Product Stewardship/Responsible Distribution\" Program.  This program requires member companies to prepare policies and procedures that promote the safe use and handling of chemical products by member companies and also by customers who purchase the chemical products.  QCWI is developing policies/procedures that address topics including the storage, handling, and transportation of compressed gases and incident planning for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nV.  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has never been an accident or accidental release involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at QCWI Fairbanks.\n\n\n\nVI.

The facility has four on-site emergency coordinators who are trained to manage all incidents that require implementation of the plan.   \n\n\n\nQCWI's Emergency Plan also utilizes trained and experienced technical contacts on-staff to support the emergency Coordinators.  Through the Emergency Plan, these technical experts can be reached at all hours of the day as a resource for emergency situations.\n\n\n\nVII.  Planned Improvements to Safety Program\n\n\n\nQCWI is committed to accident prevention and, accordingly, maintains an excellent reputation in the chemical distribution industry.  The primary planned improvement to QCWI's safety program is an update of the training materials (e.g., videos and handouts) to meet revised regulatory requirements.\n\n"
