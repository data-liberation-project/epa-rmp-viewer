The facility stores methane (a flammable gas) in quantities in excess of the 10,000 pound Risk Management Program threshold.\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR \u00a7 68.150, the facility is required to submit a single Risk Management Plan (RMP) that includes the information required by \u00a7 68.150 through 68.195.  The facility is also required to provide an executive summary in the RMP.  The following is a brief description of various elements of the facility's Risk Management Program, as required by 40 CFR \u00a7 68.155.\n\n(a)\tTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe owner recognizes that the safe handling of methane is critical to the welfare of the community.  The owner recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lists methane as a regulated flammable substance pursuant to the Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nThe owner is committed to implementing the stringent safety precautions required by the regulation of methane at its facility.  These safety precautions are necessary to prevent accidental releases of methane that could threaten the health of employees, contractors, members of the community, and the environment.  To this end, the owner implements routine equipment maintenance, operational procedures, employee training, and notification and coordination with emergency responders, and is committed to compliance with all applicable regulations.\n\n(b)\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility receives renewable natural gas (RNG), which is methane that has been produced by processing biogas generated in anaerobic digesters.

      "SummaryText": "e RNG methane arrives as compressed gas in tube trailers and is unloaded into a facility operated by the local utility. The facility serves as an unloading facility only; no treatment or processing occurs. Components beyond the truck (pressure and temperature regulation, quality control analysis and pipeline injection, etc.) are under the ownership and control of the utility and are therefore outside of the regulated process. \n\n(c)\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility has established an accidental release prevention program, which establishes the protocols needed to safely handle and use methane.  The plan is designed to prevent and minimize the effects of an unplanned, sudden or non-sudden incidents involving methane.\n\nSpecifically this plan protects the community using a combination of operating procedures and safe work practices, equipment design, emergency operations and shut-down procedures, design, detection, and employee training and education.\n\nIn the event that the RNG methane gas cannot be unloaded, it is returned to the processing plant for unloading and destruction by flare.\n\nThe facility is equipped with explosive gas detectors, hydrogen sulfide detectors and flame detectors. The process controls are programmed to initiate an emergency shutdown and sound an alarm if any of these detectors are activated. \n\nThe requirements of the accidental release prevention program will be implemented as an on-going compliance policy to ensure that methane is safely stored, handled and used by the facility.  This plan provides direction for the current and future use and handling of methane so as to minimize its impact on the community.\n\n(d)\tTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility is new; in the last five (5) years, there have been no releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property"

If able to safely do so, in the event of a fire, explosion or hazardous material release emergency, facility personnel will press the emergency stop (E-Stop) to activate the local alarm and initiate a process emergency shut down. When the local alarm sounds, or if a fire or explosion occurs, facility personnel evacuate to a safe distance and contact local emergency responders in accordance with the facility's Emergency Action Plan. \n\n(f)\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility is new; no changes are planned to improve safety."
