A program for the new Unit 3 SCR ammonia process was established in September 2008 prior to loading ammonia into the process.

Five-year Accident History\r\nThe McIntosh/Northside facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\r\n5.  Emergency Response Program\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant/Northside WWTP has a written emergency response plan in place that complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120 (a) and (q).  The plan has been coordinated with Polk County Fire Department, and the District 7 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.\r\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant/Northside WWTP will implement recommendations resulting from process hazards analyses and PSM audits to improve the safety of the facilities."

      "SummaryText": "30,400 gallons, the Ammonia Unloading Procedure limits the tank level to 85% of capacity for a  maximum total inventory of 25,840 gallons or approximately 131, 273 pounds of ammonia (at 70\u00b0F and 128.8 psia).      At Unit 3, a SCR process is being added that will be supplied by two 30,400 gallon vessels of anhydrous ammonia.  The level in these vessels is also administratively limited to 85% for a maximum total inventory of 51,680 gallons or 262,534 pounds of ammonia.  Both processes therefore exceed the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia.\r\nThe Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant adds chlorine to the filtered wastewater as a disinfection agent.  The chlorination process includes twelve one-ton containers of liquefied chlorine gas.  Three one-ton containers are on-line, three are on standby, and up to six are in storage.  The maximum chlorine inventory in the process at any one time us therefore 24,000 pounds.  This exceeds the 2,500-lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine. Northside operators use a 2 ton overhead hoist to move full containers into place for use and to return empty containers to the storage area. In 2013, a chlorine building was constructed to fully enclose the chlorine container storage area.  The chlorine building doors are normally closed during operation of the process.  The building is equipped with a scrubber unit to capture chlorine gas emissions in the event of a release from a chlorine container.  The exhaust fan and louvers are interlocked to the chlorine detectors, such that in the event of a chlorine release, the released chlorine will be exhausted through the scrubber.  \r\n3.  Prevention Programs\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant and Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant have separate programs in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Programs were established in 1997 for the chlorine processes.  The McIntosh Power Plant PSM program was established in June of 2001 for the"

      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant is part of Lakeland Electric a division of the City of Lakeland, Florida.  The Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant is part of the Wastewater Operation Division of the City of Lakeland, Florida.  The City of Lakeland requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  The City of Lakeland Office of Risk Management provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\r\n2.  Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe McIntosh Power Plant is located on the north shore of Lake Parker.  McIntosh consists of the following electric generating units:  one oil and gas-fired steam electric generating unit (Unit 2), one coal-fired steam electric generating unit (Unit 3), and one diesel and gas combined cycle turbine unit (Unit 5).  One oil-fired steam electric generating unit (Unit 1) was retired on Dec 31, 2015. The McIntosh facility supplies electric power to the City of Lakeland and the surrounding area.  The Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant, located on property adjacent to the McIntosh facility, includes disinfection, filtration, clarification, and aeration processes that treat wastewater for the City of Lakeland.  Since the McIntosh and Northside facilities are located on one contiguous property and have a common owner, they filed a joint Title V Air Permit.  For this reason, they submit their Risk Management Plan jointly to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility will therefore be referred to as McIntosh/Northside facility.\r\nAt Unit 5, the McIntosh Power Plant stores liquefied anhydrous ammonia in one 30,400-gallon tank for addition to the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System.  Although the tank has a total capacity of"
