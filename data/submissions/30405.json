Goodwin Water Treatment Plant is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures through various training, safety, emergency and accidental release prevention programs, and overall process safety management.  The City is responsible for the training of all employees at the water treatment plant.  All new employees are provided training in the following topics, at a minimum:  the requirements of Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, chemicals used in the plant, how to read and get information from MSDS's, process hazards, use of personal protective equipment, emergency procedures, understanding process safety management, and the location of MSDS's, PSMP, and other safety information.  In addition to initial training, employees are trained on various topics related to the facility and its processes once every two weeks at a minimum.\n     The City of Cayce Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is located along Charleston Highway (U.S. 321) adjacent to the Congaree Creek in Cayce, SC.  The plant currently has a daily process capacity of 9.6 million gallons per day, on average.  Treatment at the plant consists of clarifier, filtration, pH adjustment, polyphosphate addition, chlorine gas injection, and fluoride addition.  The following substances (and the maximum quantity stored of each) are used in the treatment processes:  carbon (4000lbs), lime (90,000 lbs),Sodium Hydroxide (50% 3500 lbs.)Potassium Permanganate(1320 Lbs.), Aluminum Sulfate (9,000 gal), Clarifloc polymer (330 gal), polyphosphate (330 gal), chlorine (4,000 lbs), and sodium silicofluoride (4,000 lbs).  Of these substances, only chlorine is held above EPA's threshold level, which is 2500 lbs.    \n      \n     The Cayce WTP has developed and implemented a  Process Safety Management Plan as required by 29 CFR 1910.119,  a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan as required under NPDES Permit No. SCG641000, and an Operations and Maintenance manual which outline vari"

Personnel safety measures and emergency health care responsibilities are also outlined in this plan.  Training which includes drills for practice in the event of an emergency release is provided at the time a new employee is hired and is also provided in refresher training courses which are provided at least every three years to current employees.\n"
