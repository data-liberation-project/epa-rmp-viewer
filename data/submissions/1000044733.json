The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are involved in reviewing the PSM  Program.  National Steak Processors has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe National Steak Processors facility is located at 301 East Fifth Avenue in Owasso, Oklahoma.  This facility provides refrigeration and freezing for food products.  The process, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration and freezing for product.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia is circulated throughout the system using p"

Compressor discharge lines are not insulted to facilitate the cooling process before arrival at the condensers.  \n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia is circulated via exterior insulated pipelines to evaporator coils throughout the cold storage facility.  Ammonia is vaporized in the evaporators and returned to the compressors.  Ammonia vapor is first returned to the booster compressors, then pulled through the intercoolers by the high stage compressors, which discharge to the condensers.  The high pressure vapor is then condensed to high pressure liquid ammonia by dispelling latent heat to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is 15,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nBuilding Codes:\n\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies having jurisdiction.  Special attention is directed to but not limited to:\n\n\n\n - AHSI/ASHRAE 15-1989 - Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n\n - ANSI/IIAR 2-1984 - Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems\n\n - ANSI BB31.5-1983 - Refrigeration Piping\n\n - ASME - Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX\n\n - UMC - Uniform Mechanical Code\n\n - UFC - Uniform Fire Code\n\n - NFPA - Fire Protection\n\n - UBC - Uniform Building Code, 1991, Seismic Zone 3\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment review of the accident history, (2009-2014), there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity o"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe NSP facility has a Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations. This Plan outlines the policies and procedures in place to respond to potential ammonia alarms or releases. NSP's policy is to contact 9-1-1 in the event of an ammonia release.  The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.  \n\n\n\nThe Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations includes the facility emergency coordinators, the staff alerting list, emergency notification list, and the hazardous materials agency notification and procedures.  This plan then proceeds to detail the procedures for employees and management in the event of a fire, evacuation, compressor room shut down, tornado, blackout, and ammonia release/clean-up.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe National Steak Processors Safety Committee is planning to complete several items as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees."
