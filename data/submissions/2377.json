The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nCity of Glendale Water and Power maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe chlorine system for the Glorietta Park Pump Station of  City of Glendale Water and Power is located at 2833 Verdugo Road, Glendale, California 91206.  The chlorine system for the Glorietta Park Pump Station consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from a maximum of two tanks at a time through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinators, it is drawn to injectors and mixed with water from the treatment processes. \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 2,000 pounds.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  Since the one-ton containers are stored enclosed in a building at the Glorietta Park Pump Station, passive mitigation measures were incorporate"

The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  Reference tables from the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, and EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, along with the SLAB modeling program were used.  This potential scenario reaches off-site and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: A release of chlorine gas from 5/16 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of chlorine due to the pressure of the tank is 5.2 pounds per minute.  However, passive mitigation measures were incorporated since the chlorine system is located inside an enclosed building at the Glorietta Park Pump Station.  Consequently, the release rate after the passive measure was calculated to be 2.8 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference tables from the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, and EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, along with the SLAB modeling program were used.  This potential scenario reaches off-site and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a chlorine gas detector in the storage room that is set at 1 ppm and will activate the visual alarm and turn on the ventilation system. At 3pp"

The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.)

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all City of Glendale Water and Power employees. Since the Glorietta Park Pump Station is an unmanned facility,  no evacuation would be required in case of a chlorine release.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the City of Glendale Water and Power responsible person, Ms. Miriam Caro Sykes at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the City of Glendale Water and Power Glorietta Park Pump Station.  The PHA was comprised of one session that included a HAZOP study, a Plant Walkthrough, a \"What-if\" analysis, and a series of checklists.   All changes are completed.\n\nR01 Implement testing prog"
