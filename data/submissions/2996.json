      "SummaryText": "At Celanese, we are dedicated to being an industry leader in protecting the environment, the health, and safety of both our employees and the communities in which we operate.  Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why Celanese has a \"zero incident\" goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental and process incidents.\n\nThe Celanese Bucks site began operations in 1970.  We have 100 employees, plus an average of 50 resident contractors.  We manufacture four amine products for Celanese.  We operate production facilities owned by Clariant, a Swiss based specialty chemical company, and we provide manufacturing services for IB Nitrogen, a subsidiary of a Canadian fertilizer company.\n\nThe Celanese amine products are:\n     Isopropylamine\n     Dipropylamine\n     Cyclohexylamine\n     Diamylamine\nThese products are used by other chemical companies to make herbicides, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe Clariant products are:\n     Sodium hydrosulfite\n     Sodium bisulfite\n     Sulfur dioxide\nThese products are used in the textile, pulp and paper, food, and wine industries.\n\nThe IB Nitrogen product is:\n     Isobutylidene diurea\nThis product is a slow-release specialty fertilizer used on golf courses and turf farms.  It is also used in plant nurseries for growing ornamentals such as azaleas and poinsettias.\n\nThe EPA's Risk Management Plan provides an excellent vehicle for continued dialogue with the people that live and work around the Celanese Bucks site.  The Celanese Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The LeMoyne Community Advisory Panel and the LeMoyne Industrial Park companies are recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding coop"

This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\nPlant Organization:\n\nThe plant has a site director (plant manager) who oversees all plant activities.  The site director oversees the plant management council.  The plant management council members include four hourly plant operations personnel, one from each of the main operating areas.  The other members of the plant management council include the members of plant management staff.  The staff includes an occupational safety manager, process safety manager, environmental manager, industrial hygienist, production manager for Celanese operations, production manager for Clariant operations, production manager for IB Nitrogen operations, financial controller, and maintenance/project engineers.\n\nProduction units are organized in teams.  All plant employees must attend at least one safety meeting per month.  All plant operators are included in a rotation to conduct a safety meetings.  Safety meetings include training on regulatory requirements and plant specific issues.  Testing is conducted in safety meetings to insure the information is understood.\n\nPlant operators are trained as part of the BEST team (the Bucks Emergency Response Team).  They learn the specifics of emergency response command, emergency response techniques, and conduct drills.\n\nWhat is RMP?\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established regulations that require Celanese and many other companies to file a Risk Management Plan (RMP) by June 21, 1999.  The Celanese Bucks Plant has 5 chemicals on a list of 140 chemicals developed by the EPA.  All companies that use, make or store a minimum quantity of these chemicals must meet these regulations.\n\nCelanese was already complying with most of the EPA's requirements for RMP through our Process Safety Management Program and to comply with the OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation).

There has never been a Worst Case Scenario type event in our 29 year history at Bucks.\n\n\nHow We Keep Our Plant Safe:\n\nPeople: Our Most Valuable Safety Resource\n\n1.  All plant operators are trained and certified in the jobs they do.\n2.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n3.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical processing, safety, and regulatory issues.\n \nEquipment: Maintained in Safe Condition\n\n1.  All plant process equipment is subjected to mechanical integrity inspections to look for corrosion or wear.\n2.  Safety devices such as pressure relief valves and shutdown systems are inspected and tested on a regular basis.\n3.  A thermographic camera allows us to check for temperature deviations in equipment, check for electrical faults, and verify levels.\n4.  Glass level gauges have been replaced with metal, magnetically-coupled gauges.\n\nSafety Systems: Protective Safety Net\n\n1.  All storage tanks and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves, much like the safety relief valve on your home water heater.\n2.  Process safety systems are programmed in our process control computers.  If a designated level, pressure, temperature, or other parameter goes out of range, the process will shut down automatically.\n3.  Video surveillance cameras are installed to help operators monitor the processes.\n4.  Gas detectors are installed to warn of leaks.  Our SO2 gas detection system will automatically stop loading operations.\n5.  Oxygen detectors protect the integrity of key equipment including va"
