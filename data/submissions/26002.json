The potentially hazardous chemical used at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Due to the hazardous properties of ammonia it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions during use to prevent human exposure, reduce the threat to our workers personal health, the surrounding community and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations that we are governed by.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia coupled with the safety devices, control measures and the safe handling procedures that our personnel are trained in.\n\nStationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nEquity Group, Georgia Division, 7220 Highway 19 N, Camilla, Georgia, is located approximately two miles north of Camilla, Georgia.  We are responsible for the processing of frozen poultry products in varies varieties.  The facility consists on two separate processing centers under one roof using a discrete Anhydrous Ammonia closed loop refrigeration system as a heat removal media for each processing center.  Both plants manufacture product around the clock, (7) seven days a week.  There are 2600 full time employees at the entire facility, which includes hourly and salary personnel.\n\nAs a result of a recognized highly toxic chemical that will be used at the Equity Group, Georgia Division and in accordance with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program, 40 CFR, Section 68 requirements.  The facility has developed and implemented prevention program # 3.  Additionally the facility has also in place a Process Safety Management program as required by OSHA Standard 1910.119 and further uses this program as a management system per the outlined requirements in 40 CFR 68.15.  \n\nHaving two separate ammonia refrigeration system process, the"
