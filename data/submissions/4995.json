Regular audits are conducted as detailed in Section 4 to ensure that these programs are in place and functioning well at the Martinez plant.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe process unit at the plant regenerates sulfuric acid from \"spent\" sulfuric acid which is received from oil refineries. Oleum is also produced in the process. Current operations at Martinez are performed by 41 full time employees. Operation of all equipment and processes is performed by these full time employees. Contractor personnel are used for some maintenance activities as required by plant operations. Contractor personnel receive training in accordance with their potential contact with hazardous materials or when assigned to work with equipment which could affect the processing or the handling of hazardous materials. \n\nSulfuric acid is the primary product at the facility. The majority of this sulfuric acid is shipped to refineries and used in the manufacturing process for gasoline.  The strength of the acid produced at the Martinez Plant varies from 93% to 105.5% (oleum). These different strengths satisfy a wide variety of applications, including metals mining, processing pulp and paper, agricultural chemicals and pesticides, and water treatment.\n\nThe chemicals used or stored in the Martinez plant that are covered by the RMP regulation are ammonia (NH3), oleum (H2SO4 supersaturated with SO3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2 dissolved in lubricant spent acid (LSA)). Table 1 identifies the location, quantity, and function of these hazardous materials. \n\nTable 1\n\nMaterial:           Ammonia\nUnit:                 Ammonia Storage\nFunction:         Removal of sulfur dioxide from effluent gas\nMax Inventory: 198,000 pounds\nProgram Level: 3\n\nMaterial:           Oleum\nUnit:                 Oleum Tower/Storage\nFunction:         Product\nMa"

Inventory: 319,000 pounds\nProgram Level: 3\n\n3.    Offsite Consequence Analysis\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, Rhodia used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  \n\nWort-Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) at the Martinez Plant, as defined by the USEPA, is the release of the total contents of a single 40,000 gallon horizontal vessel which is 80% full of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) over a 10 minute period. No credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario.  The effected distance for the WCS was calculated using the look-up tables in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants that was officially accepted by the EPA on October 28th, 1998.  These look-up tables were used to be consistent with other stationary sources that store anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe maximum distance to the given toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm is 5 miles.  This toxic endpoint is determined by the EPA and corresponds with the ERPG2 value for ammonia.  The definition of ERPG2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all persons exposed for up to 1 hour will not experience or develop irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.\n\nUsing the census data from LandView III, the estimated population within the worst-case scenario circle is about 34,000.  This population includes residences, schools, hospitals, child-care facilities, nursing homes, libraries, churches, parks, business/industrial facilities and correctional facilities.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for each toxic substance stored on site was selected from the results "

PHAST is a dispersion modeling program that takes into consideration more details than the look-up tables allow.\n\nAmmonia Alternate Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of ammonia at the Martinez Plant  is defined as a failure of a hose during the unloading of an ammonia truck.  The truck is equipped with an excess flow valve that closes at a flow rate above 283 lb/min.   The hose rupture was assumed to be big enough to get the maximum flow out of the excess flow valve, but small enough not to close the valve.  This represents the most conservative assumptions.  The driver is present at the unloading station during the entire unload process.  The truck is equipped with an emergency handle in the back that will close the valve if pulled.  This can be done by the driver as soon as a problem is observed.  For this scenario it was assumed that it takes the driver 3 minutes to pull the emergency handle.  This is once again conservative.  The result is a spill of 849 pounds of ammonia in 3 minutes time. \n\nThe maximum distance to the given toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm is 0.6 miles.  This toxic endpoint is determined by the EPA and corresponds with the ERPG2 value for ammonia.  The definition of ERPG2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all persons exposed for up to 1 hour will not experience or develop irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.  \n\nUsing the census data from LandView III, the estimated population within a 1 mile radius of the plant is 490.  There are no sensitive receptors within this radius.\n\nThe unloading hoses are property of the ammonia distributor.

This has been very successful as a preventative measure.\n\nOleum\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of oleum at the Martinez Plant  is defined as a leak in the circulation loop for the storage tank, which is located outside of the containment building.   A failure of the pipe was estimated to result in a pinhole leak 1/8\" in length.  It was assumed that the leak continues unnoticed for two hours.  This is very conservative since a cloud would result making the leak immediately noticeable to operating personnel, who could then shut down the unit remotely from the control room.  The total quantity of SO3 released in a two hour period would be about 143 pounds.  \n\nThe maximum distance to the given toxic endpoint of 0.01 mg/L is 0.3 miles.  This toxic endpoint is determined by the EPA and corresponds with the ERPG2 value for SO3. The definition of ERPG2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all persons exposed for up to 1 hour will not experience or develop irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action.  \n\nUsing the census data from LandView III, the estimated population within a 1 mile radius of the plant is 490. There are no sensitive receptors within this radius.\n\nRoutine visual inspections of oleum process piping are performed 7 days per week by our operations personnel.  Oleum piping is formally inspected and documented at least every 5 years as part of our maintenance integrity program.\n\nSulfur Dioxide (dissolved in Lubricant Spent Acid)\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of lubricant spent acid at the Martinez Plant  is defined as the over-pressurization of a trailer during the unloading sequence.

A high pressure interlock that stops the nitrogen flow to the trailer.  This interlock would prevent putting any additional pressure on the trailer.\n2. A pressure relief valve located on the trailer that will relieve at 42 pounds per square inch.  The relief of this valve would remove the excess pressure from the trailer and not allow it to reach a pressure high enough to rupture.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Rhodia Martinez Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in risk analysis, engineering, process operations, and maintenance.  All process hazard analyses are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 10/29/1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Rhodia Martinez Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  All operating procedures are reviewed and recertified annually\n\nTraining\nThe Rhodia Martinez Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Rhodia Martinez Plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices and the potential hazards involved with each unit.  Furthermore, specialized training is offered as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.
