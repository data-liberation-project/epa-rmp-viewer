      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Goodrich Aircraft Wheels & Brakes Santa Fe Springs facility produces carbon brakes for aircraft.  Carbon textile material is received by the facility and is first cut, sized and prepared for the brake production process.  The textile is then sent to the furnace deck area where it undergoes carbonization and densification in a series of furnaces.  All the process furnaces use propane.  Next, the densified carbon brake parts are machined to the appropriate configuration.  Finally, the non-wearing surfaces of the brakes are coated with an oxidation inhibitor and mounting hardware is attached.  Some reprocessing of used brakes is also conducted at the facility.  In addition to the direct manufacturing activities, a variety of support operations are involved at the Santa Fe Springs facility.  On-site laboratories perform both research and development, and quality assurance/quality control functions.  Both routine and non-routine maintenance is also conducted on equipment.\n\nMETHYLTRICHLOROSILANE\n\nThe facility uses methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) in the brake production process.  The facility maintains a maximum of three 1,000 pound cylinders of MTS ontsite at any one time. Two cylinders of MTS are connected to the process and are wrapped with a heat blanket to maintain a temperature of 85 F.  Each cylinder attached to the process is equipped with a nitrogen bubbler to aid the vaporization of MTS to feed the process. The maximum process feed rate of MTS is 5 grams per minute.  The third reserve cylinder is kept in the gas feed area with the two cylinders attached to the process. The cylinders are located in a gas feed area that is above the diked area. The dimensions of the diked area are 5 feet by 5 feet by 1.75 feet deep. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Goodrich Santa Fe Springs facility has not had an accident involving the methyltrichlorosilane systems during the past five years which resulted in any deaths, injuries, or responses or restoration activit"

The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n? The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of methyltrichlorosilane and the design of the system and equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the propane systems.\n\n? The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assumes that employees that utilize the methyltrichlorosilane system are most knowledgeable about it and are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n? The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the methyltrichlorosilane system using the what-if/checklist technique.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing methyltrichlorosilane system in depth and analyzed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failures; (5) facility citing; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA resulted in several procedural and/or hardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the systems.  These recommendations are targeted for resolution before the end of the second quarter of 1999.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n? Written operating procedures (OPs) are use"

The OPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n? Methyltrichlorosilane system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to the MTS processes.\n\n? Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n\n? Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of methyltrichlorosilane are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\n\n? Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the methyltrichorosilane system are ?pre-qualified? based on their knowledge of the systems, understanding of applicable codes and standards, written safety and training programs, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.\n\n? Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\n\n?

The ERP covers the regulatory requirements for emergency response training, evacuation procedures, procedures for notifying the public, government agencies, and local emergency response agencies of a release, procedures for the maintenance of emergency response equipment, and emergency management and organization structures.\n\nThe ERP also contains complete instructions for responding to specific emergencies, including fires, medical emergencies, indoor and outdoor oil spills, flammable materials releases, natural disasters, workplace violence, and bomb threats."
