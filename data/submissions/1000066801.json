The facility is designed as a vertically integrated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing facility that also produces intermediate products, including chlorine (and caustic soda as a byproduct), ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride monomer, and hydrochloric acid.This facility has been designed in a manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases. Shintech is committed to operating this facility in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment. Shintech has many years of experience and an excellent environmental and safety track record in the production of polyvinyl chloride. Shintech strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. Shintech has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter 59).

A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well-trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The facility has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for fire fighting and emergency rescue. In addition to handling the release, the facility is also participating in established communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. Through the coordination with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the facility has the ability to provide emergency notification to the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1.1 Develop and Implement a Management System (CFR 68.15)\r\n\r\nThe owner/operator shall develop a management system to oversee the implementation of risk management pro"

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\n2.3.11 Incident investigation:\r\n\r\nThe owner/operator shall investigate each incident which resulted in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nAn incident investigation shall be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident.\r\n\r\nAn incident investigation team shall be established and consist of at least one knowledgeable person in the process involved.\r\n\r\nA report shall be prepared, including at least: the date of incident, date investigation began, description of incident, factors leading to incident, and recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe owner/operator shall establish as system to promp"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.0 APPLICABILITY \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program, required under Section 112 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, was promulgated on June 20, 1996. The requirements, codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A-H, require any facility that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process to comply with the requirements of the Risk Management Program and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). \r\n\r\nRegulated flammable and toxic substances and their corresponding threshold quantities (TQ) (under 40 CFR 68, Subpart C and Tables 1 through 4 of 68.130) are identified for the purpose of determining applicability. The threshold determination for mixtures of flammable substances is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2). In cases where the listed substance is greater than one percent by weight of the mixture (for a flammable), the entire weight of the mixture is considered in the threshold determination, unless it can be demonstrated that the mixture itself does not have a National Fire Protection Associations (NFPA) flammable hazard rating of 4. Where toxic substances are found in greater than one percent by weight of a mixture, only the weight of the toxic substance is considered in threshold determination. Table 1 lists the regulated substances and the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe onsite in a covered process at the Shintech Louisiana, LLC Shintech Plaquemine Plant Complex (Shintech). The Complex currently incorporates the following facilities: Shintech Plaquemine Plant 1 (SPP-1), Shintech Plaquemine Plant 2 (SPP-2), Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 1 (HAPF-1), and Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 2 (HAPF-2).  Shintech is currently in the process of constructing a Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 3 (HAPF-3) and a Plaquemine Ethylene Plant 1 (PEP-1).\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\nRegulated RMP Chemical\r\nType\r\nCAS Number\r\nRMP TQ (in lbs)\r\nTotal Quantity Capable of Being Present in a Process (in lbs)\r\nLocation of Process\r\nChlorine"
