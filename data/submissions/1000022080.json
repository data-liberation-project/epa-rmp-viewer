The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage. \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system design is a direct ammonia process utilizing a standard closed-loop design consisting of compressors, condensers, high-pressure and low-pressure ammonia storage vessels, ice makers, and freezer vaults. The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, low oil differential on all compressors, level control switches on all applicable vessels and approved pressure safety relief valves on all applicable equipment that discharge into a common header venting into a 3,000 gallon deluge tank located outside the facility. Ammonia detectors and alarms are installed throughout the plant.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility's program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\r\n\r\nThe Reddy Ice-Davie facility is committed to operating a safe and compliant ammonia refrigeration system for the protection of its employees, the general public and the environment.  The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the ammonia process.  These include continuous exhaust purge fans in the engine room, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are violated, and the capability of shutting down the entire system remotely if required. Administrative controls are in limiting the utilization of vessels to less than"

No current major system changes are planned. On a corporate level, Reddy Ice continues to implement changes to improve safety and decrease environmental impacts at all plants."

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-Davie management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements.

Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. An established safety committee meets each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Davie facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Reddy Ice-Davie facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\r\nThe Reddy Ice-Davie facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the EAP. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\r\n\r\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the South Florida Regional Planning Council and the Davie Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed.
