The vines are tended and nurtured throughout the growing season by following up-to-date, progressive agricultural practices, which provide optimum development of the fruit. During the fall harvest season, the grapes are picked according to specific quality criteria and delivered to the winery to be processed into wine. Transported from the vineyard by trucks, grapes of many varieties arriving in 6-ton bins are separated into specific lots for crushing. The crushing process separates the thousands of gallons of juice from the skins, seeds and stems of the grapes to prepare the juice to become wine. This conversion process of juice to wine is called fermentation, and is accomplished with a microscopic organism called yeast. Wine lots of 3,000 to 350,000 gallons are then moved through various processes to clarify, consolidate, blend and finish into a product that is ready for our customers to consume. Many thousands of gallons of wine flow through miles of pipelines and numerous pieces of equipment and tanks of various shapes and sizes before reaching the final destination, the customer's glass.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Processes\n\nDuring our winemaking process there are many stages where refrigeration of the juice or wine is important to retain certain quality characteristics. One system installed in our facility to perform this task utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant chemical.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency lists anhydrous ammonia as an Extremely Hazardous Substance with a Threshold Planning Quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The process refrigeration equipment at Delicato Vineyards uses ammonia as the refrigerant gas. The system is comprised of two vessels linked to have a combined quantity of ~19,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a fixed installation set on concrete foundations. The system consists of two compressors, a condenser, evaporator, associated piping, "

The thermodynamic reaction cycles of ammonia expansion from a liquid to a gas, and compression of the gas back into a liquid all within a closed system, provides the necessary removal of heat from our wine and grape products. The period of heaviest refrigeration use is during the grape harvest season, usually from August through November.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia has been a commonly used refrigerant gas for decades because it is highly efficient. Ammonia is a naturally occurring compound, and some scholars believe the atmosphere of the earth was originally composed of ammonia (NH3) and water (H2O). Ammonia has also been extensively used as a primary fertilizer in our country's prosperous agriculture industry for many years through a process of direct injection into the soil. It is commonly used in many households as a cleaner for windows, floors and countertops. Treated with respect, ammonia provides tremendous benefit in the processes in which it is used to enhance our country's economy.\n\nBeing classified as a hazardous material, ammonia can be dangerous if it is mishandled. The concentrated liquid can freeze tissue and cause chemical burns. In a gaseous form of sufficient strength, it can be inhaled to cause immediate burning of lung tissue. This is why extensive safety precautions and equipment are in place at our facility using anhydrous ammonia. Since our previous RMP submittal we have updated equipment drawings of the refrigeration package and increased the amount of labeling on each valve and pipe within the refrigeration package. The company committed to this improvement to increase the level of awareness within the companyA?s refrigeration technician population and to increase the standardization of the process. The company has also installed a state-of-the-art control panel that allows for a user to monitor all sa"

In the event of a release, an emitting refrigeration package could be isolated and shutdown remotely thus decreasing the response time and corrective action time in the event of a discharge. Structural barricades have also been erected around refrigeration packages that are susceptible to heavy internal traffic, transporting grapes, or grape processing material. The company has also improved the procedures of routine maintenance operation and the internal mechanical integrity program. All of these improvements were conceived from cross-functional review meetings designed to increase the quality of the companyA?s RMP.\n\nInterestingly, ammonia-related deaths and injuries are more common from misuse of household ammonia used for cleaning purposes than from the millions of tons of anhydrous ammonia used around the world for industrial and agricultural processes.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Accidental Releases: During the last five years there has been one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at our winery that resulted in known sheltering in place for our employees who were on-site. There were no off-site consequences as a result of the incident. The release was caused by a short increase in line pressure that triggered a pressure relief valve to discharge prematurely. Once the valve discharged the spring-loaded valve failed to close once the line pressure decreased which caused more ammonia to be released from the process line. The line was eventually isolated and the ammonia release ceased. The pressure relief valve was replaced and relocated to better location on the line to prevent premature discharge and safe discharge. The process control logic was also tuned to prevent sudden increases and to react quicker to discharges from pressure relief valves within the syste"

The plan is intended to minimize the serious effects of an event through preparation and training. Components of the Plan that accomplish this are as follows:\n\n* Pre-emergency planning, including scenario drills and coordination with outside emergency providers.\n\n* Definition of personnel roles for recognizing, preventing, and maintaining site security and control.\n\n* A communication system for alerting personnel for response procedures, evacuation to safe refuges and coordination with outside responders.\n\n* Provisions for medical treatment, first aid, and decontamination.\n \n* Organization and training of Emergency Response Team with necessary personal protective and other emergency equipment.\n\nA group of Production and Maintenance personnel make up the Emergency Response Team and all have training to the Hazardous Materials Technician level as specified in 29CFR1910.120(q).\n\nPlanned Safety Improvement\n\nContinuous improvement in the facility safety is realized from strengthening employee knowledge through regular training. Operations and Maintenance personnel receive training through monthly safety meetings and periodic processing review sessions. A group of employees from each department, which makes up the Emergency Response Team, participate in periodic emergency preparedness training throughout the year. Improvements in mechanical integrity are also providing a more thorough ability to repair or replace parts in the systems before they have a chance to fail. The company is currently reviewing its Ammonia mechanical contractor firmA?s safety record and safety system to determine where improvements can be made to increase their safety as well as our safety and compliance.
