Chlorine has been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a regulated substance subject to section 112 r of the Clean Air Act, which required the preparation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Kemira Water Solutions is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard and is submitting a program level 3 Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe facility is located at 10 Bremen Ave, St. Louis, MO, in what is primarily an industrial district near downtown St. Louis and the Mississippi River.\n\n2.  It is Kemira Water Solutions' policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nThe owners and management of this facility regard employee and public safety as a very serious matter and have taken many precautions to maintain a safe working public environment.  Some of these steps include:\n\nInstalling chlorine sensors and alarms;\nInstalling an automatic shutoff valve on the railcar unloading system;\nInstituting safe operating procedures;\nTraining employees in safety programs and procedures;\nWriting a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan;\nCoordinating with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n3.  Process Description\n\nChlorine is received in 90-ton rail tank cars.  Normally, two to seven rail tank cars are present on-site at a time.  However, when the quantity in one car is low (approximately 10 tons), a second car is ordered.  Seven cars may be on site at one time. They are stored under ambient temperatures which can exceed 100 degrees F in the summer.  Normal internal pressure is 60 to 70 psig, but on a hot day pressures may reach 180 psig in the process.\n\nThere are four reaction vessels which involve the use of chlorine.  The reaction vessels are designated F-34, F-31, F-35, and F-26. Ferric Chloride and Ferrous Chloride are made in a continuous process.  The"

      "SummaryText": "re is an oxidation reduction probe on tank F-31 to prevent it from overchlorinating.  Tank F-31, F-32, and F-34 are ferrous chloride tanks that can absorb chlorine from a fully open valve.  Each tank is equiped with a relief set at 20\" water column vacuum and 40\" water column pressure to prevent tank rupture.  The system operates at a slight vacuum so that air will pull into the system if there is a leak.The system has over pressure alarms.\n\nChlorine gas is piped from the railcars to the reaction vessels, where it reacts with ferrous chloride to form ferric chloride.\n\n\n4.  General accidental release prevention program\n\nThis facility has a strong commitment to the safe handling of chlorine and to minimizing the probability of an accidental release.  This is achieved through a combination of personnel training, process safety equipment, and operating procedures.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history\n\nThere has been no accidental releases of Chlorine in the past 5 years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response program.  The Emergency Response Plan contains specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of chlorine, procedures to inform the public and health care information.  All employees working with chlorine are given 40 hour Hazwoper training with annual 8 hour refreshers.   This plan has been coordinated with the St. Louis LEPC.  The telephone number fo the LEPC is (314)  289-1900.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe system was changed in 2005 to continuous to be safer.  No new plans needed at this time."
