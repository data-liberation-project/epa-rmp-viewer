      "SummaryText": "This RMP was developed for Kagome, Inc. for the facility located in Los Banos, California.  The program covers anhydrous ammonia (ammonia).  Ammonia is utilized at the facility as a refrigerant and a maximum of approximately 9,000 lbs. are on site at anytime.  This quantity is above the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold quantity of 500 lbs and dictates that Kagome complete a Program 2 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Kagome, Inc. RMP document has been prepared in accordance with CalARP Regulations for Program 2 facilities and with local requirements prescribed by Merced County.\n\nThe worst case and alternative case accidental releases for ammonia was assessed and modeled.  The scenarios are:\n\nWorst Case:  Release of entire system contents over a 10-minute period\n\nAlternative Case:  Release of entire system contents over a 1-hour period.\n\nKagome has developed a schedule for implementing measures to prevent and mitigate the effects and limit the distances for the reported scenarios.  The risk reduction measures include:  developing additional written operating procedures, investigating roof construction for the exterior ammonia area, implementing additional training, posting warnings, examining maintenance procedures, and updating P&IDs.\n\nKagome has not had a reportable accidental release of ammonia in the past five years.\n\nKagome has a written Emergency Action Plan that includes specific actions to be taken by facility employees in response to an accidental release of ammonia.  The facility has personnel trained in emergency response.  The Plan includes procedures for coordinating with local agencies responding to accidental releases and informing the public."
