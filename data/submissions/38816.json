If an accidental release should occur the facility is prepared to work with the Albany Fire Department, Albany Police Department, Stearns County Sheriff Department, and any other authorities involved to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery to area farmers for application to their fields.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quanity stored would be 78,795 pounds in one 18,000 gallon tank.  The maximum quanity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a six minute period.  The maximum quanity would be 78,795 pounds representing 85 percent of the capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.1 miles.  The alternate release scenerio, based on a two minute release, is a release from a break in a 3 inch transfer hose.  The distance to the end point is .81 miles.  The facility has implimented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1\".  published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years at this site.  Upsala Cooperative Association has a written action plan, is in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38, and has provided state and "
