The facility is located at the southwest corner of Arroyo Parkway and Glenarm Street, at the northern end of the 110 freeway.  The area surrounding the facility is primarily light commercial and residential.  The facility is surrounded by a chain link fence with locked gates.  Visitors are required to check in with facility personnel upon arrival.\n\nThe Broadway Power Plant Unit B-3 is a 71 MW unit that was placed in commercial operation in 1965.  The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system was installed in 1994.  The facility uses aqueous ammonia to catalytically reduce boiler flue gas nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to elemental nitrogen and water.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of aqueous ammonia at the Broadway Power Plant is 12,000 gallons (89,600 pounds).\n\nAqueous ammonia, 29.4% weight anhydrous ammonia,  is used at the City of Pasadena Power Plant in the Unit B-3 Steam Plant Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)  system to help maintain air quality compliance of the emission stack, specifically, reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions.  Depending on which fuel is burned, the SCR system provides a reduction efficiency of between 60-90%.  When in operating mode, the aqueous ammonia system is automatically controlled based on system demand.  The aqueous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon tank inside a bermed containment area equipped with a manual drain.\n\nThe liquid aqueous ammonia is pulled from the tank through the ammonia shut off valve by two pumps.  It then travels through double walled piping, underground, to the first level of the Power Plant.  There it flows through a strainer manifold and then travels up to the fifth level where it flows through a back pressure regulator control valve, a flow control valve to the vaporizer and then the injection grid.  The catalyst bed provides the surface area for the SCR reactions to occur.\n\nThe ammonia shut "

The aqueous ammonia is mixed with compressed air prior to entering the vaporizer where it is mixed with hot blower air and then fed to either the economizer superheat-side or the economizer reheat-side of the ammonia injection grid in the combustion exhaust stack.\n\nThe NOx in the flue gas reacts with ammonia in the SCR reactor catalyst layers to form harmless elemental nitrogen and water.  The elemental nitrogen and water remain in the flue gas as it passes through the stack to the atmosphere.  The SCR reactor is designed for a NOx reduction efficiency of 89.3% when firing natural gas.\n\nThe SCR system is equipped with various automatic process controls which ensure safe and efficient operation of the SCR reactor, vaporizer, metering pumps, shut-off and regulating valves.  In addition, pressure relief valves automatically engage in the event the system experiences a very high pressure situation.  In case of an ammonia leak, four ammonia sensing devices will provide an alarm locally and in the control room.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (the liquid storage tank) - 12,000 gallons (90,000 pounds) in 10 minutes.  The liquid is assumed to leak into the concrete berm (passive mitigation) that surrounds the tank and then evaporate (rate = 34 lbs/min).  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.

The evaporation rate of the pooled liquid aqueous ammonia is calculated to be 33.0 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe storage of aqueous ammonia at the PWP Broadway Power Plant is governed by many safety features.  Much of the safety of the process is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the Broadway Power Plant operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The aqueous ammonia system is checked by operators on a daily basis.\n\nThe Broadway Power Plant maintains tight control of its aqueous ammonia system through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there are three mechanisms at the facility to minimize the impact:  1) ammonia vapor detectors, 2) liquid sensor, and 3) associated alarms.  There are four vapor detectors located in the following locations throughout the system: Bermed Storage Area, Feed Pump Skid, Vaporizer Area, Catalyst Expansion Joint.  The ammonia sensors activate a local alarm and an alarm in the control room that is always manned.  The liquid sensor is located in the Underground Secondary Containment area.  All ammonia detectors provide an alarm to alert operators.\n\nOther aut"

The pressure relief/vaccum breaker setpoints are 25 psig/-0.125 psi.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the previous five years (since August 1995), there have been no aqueous ammonia accidents at the facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPWP has an emergency action plan in effect.

These areas may require that the Plant acquire an ammonia detector device (hand held, dreager, etc.). Company policy is that control room operator is notified prior to an operator entering the vault / tunnel area.  This has been a topic during safety meetings (March 2000)  to review this company policy of notifying the control room.\n\nR17    Verify that the piping in the tunnel is properly labeled. \n\nR18    Document preventive maintenance requirements for the air side of the system.\n\nR19    Review preventive maintenance requirements for system components such as regulators, valves, and indicators.\n\nR20    Examine the potential ammonia concentration in the event of a release at the expansion joint in the Off-Site Consequence Analysis (maximum flow rate is 45 gallons per hour of aqueous ammonia).\n\nR21    Depending on the results of R19, consider the feasibility of wiring the electrical so that the operator can tell in the control room which ammonia detector has been activated.\n\nR22    Update the emergency response plan to include a leak on the 5th floor and to incorporate the results of R19 and R20. Once the ammonia flow is stopped, the operator can examine the equipment for air flow out of the expansion joint.\n\nR23    Following implementation of R20 and R21, consider changing the response plan so that the operator does not use the elevator for responding to an ammonia release.\n\nR24    Determine the maintenance requirements and/or life expectancy of the expansion joints.\n\nR25    Review the air intake location of the control room to ensure that it is a safe location for the operators during a release.\n\nR26    Reevaluate the need for SCBAs (confined space entry). Based on this evaluation, consider implementing an escape mask policy, update the Respiratory Protection Program, and/or institute the training requiremen"
