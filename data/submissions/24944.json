Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of W.C. Gretter & Sons, Inc. at their Harper, Iowa\nlocation (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous\nammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\ndepartment, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people\nand the environment.\n\n     2.   Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of fertilizer to area farmers. Anhydrous\nammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in three (3) storage tanks 2 @15,000 gallons each\nand I @ 12,000 gallons and 16 nurse tanks @ 1,000 gallons each. The maximum quantity stored\nwould be about 251,430 pounds.\n\n     3.   Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nA) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released\nas gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be about 50,000\npounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited\nby design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or\nppm) is about 3.4 miles.\n\nB) The Alternate Case Release Scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most\nlikely potential incident), is a release from a rupture disk / relief valve failure. The distance to the\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is about 0.19 miles. The maximum quantity released\nwould be about 1,000 pounds.\n\n     4.   Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety\nRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-6 1. 1\", publish"

(ANSI) and the standards of the United States\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". 'The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa\nAdministrative Code Part 2 I -Chapter 43-Rule 43. 6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form\nSection 8.3.b.\n\n     5.   Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have\ncaused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,\nhave resulted in on-site deaths, injuries' evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or\nenvironmental damage.\n\n     6.   Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38; and\n\nb. provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community\nright-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n     7.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety\nrecommendations regarding storage or use anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
