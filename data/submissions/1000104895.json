The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activity at Pittsburg Operations is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Pittsburg Operations has six regulated substances present at the site.  These substances include ammonia (aqueous), ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride is used to make an agricultural intermediate.  The site manages sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) railcars for a site tenant that uses the sulfur dioxide to manufacture an agricultural product. \n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nPittsburg Operations has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
