      "SummaryText": "1.1  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY SUMMARY\n\nThe Arlington East Water Reclamation Facility is a critical part of the JEA water supply and waste water treatment system.  JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of JEA and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in full compliance with all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the Facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable OSHA and EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, JEA has developed an integrated Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan (the Plan) for the Facility.  Among the important components of the Plan are JEA's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the Facility, and JEA's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility. \n\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Facility is designed for the treatment of waste water from Jacksonville's sanitary sewer system.  The Facility uses chlorine for waste water disinfection (the chlorine system), and sulfur dioxide to control the level of residual chlorine in the treated effluent (the sulfur dioxide system). \n\nChlorine is delivered to the Facility via truck and stored in silver-colored one-ton (2,000 pounds) containers which are used onsite as storage vessels.  These containers are stored and used in the chlorination/ sulfonation building near the southeast corner of the Facility property.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this location is 24,000 pounds, in one-ton containers (12 containers).  Sulfur dioxide is delivered to the Facility in yellow-colored ton containers which are used onsite as storage vessels.  The containers are also located in the chlorination/sulfonation building.

      "SummaryText": "aximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide at this location is 16,000 pounds, in one-ton containers (8 containers). \n\nTo facilitate the chlorination process, six (6) one-ton containers (12,000 pounds) are simultaneously connected to a split manifold configuration that has two banks of three containers.  Only one bank is active at any given time, meaning that a total maximum of three containers (6,000 pounds) of chlorine are attached on-line when the active containers are full.  A similar configuration is used for the sulfonation process.  However, only four (4) one-ton containers (8,000 pounds) of sulfur dioxide are connected to the manifold, and only two (2) one-ton containers (4,000 pounds) are active.\n\n\n1.3 WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the 10-minute release of the contents of one full one-ton container of chlorine, or 2,000 pounds, as required by applicable Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  Consideration was given to a release of one full one-ton container of sulfur dioxide, or 2,000 pounds, over a ten minute period.  However, the endpoint for that scenario was found to be a shorter distance from the Facility than that for the chlorine release.  Thus, the chlorine release was used as the worst case release scenario. Because the chlorine containers are stored and used within a building, the Facility qualifies for a passive mitigation credit of 45 percent that is applied against the release rate.  Using the methodology prescribed in the regulations, this worst case release scenario results in potential impacts to off-site receptors. \n\nA more realistic, alternative release scenario also was examined for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  For this scenario, it was assumed that the ton containers were half full, resulting in a release of 1,000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  In addition, a more realistic release period of 30 minutes was used for the alternative case scenario.  These scenarios also resu"

This program is documented in the integrated Plan and is based on the requirements of applicable PSM/RMP regulations.  The effectiveness of this program is evident by the fact that the Facility has had no significant releases of chlorine in the five years prior to the date of this Plan.\n\n\n1.5  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Facility in the five years prior to the date of the Plan that resulted in injuries or death to Facility or Contractor employees onsite or the offsite public, or damage to potential environmental receptors.\n\n\n1.6  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  This ERP has been communicated to the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department (JFRD) and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  It is JEA's policy with regard to emergency response that its personnel are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance release and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the release.  They would take no further action beyond notifying the authorities of the release.  Thus, it is JEA's policy for employees to call 911 in the event of a release emergency and allow the local Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Team to mitigate the release conditions.  The JFRD is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of offsite areas is necessary, and for public notification.\n\n\n1.7  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Plan incorporates a number of m"
