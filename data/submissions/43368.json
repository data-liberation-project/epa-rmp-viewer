The subsidiary was formed on July 1, 2005 after separation from DuPont Dow Elastomers L.L.C.  Globally, DuPont Performance Elastomers offers a wide variety of products ranging from thermoset rubber polymers used in the general rubber industry to high-performance fluoroelastomers used by the chemical processing and automotive industries. \n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires certain companies, like ours, to share information about the chemicals we use, the potential risks those chemicals pose to the community, the ways that we manage these risks, and the plans we have made to respond to a possible release of these chemicals.  This requirement is part of the Congress's Clean Air Act known as the Risk Management Planning (RMP) rule.  This executive summary is provided in compliance with 40 CFR \u00a7 68.155 of the RMP rule.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDupont Performance Elastomers Hypalon\u00ae Unit is committed to operating and maintaining our process in a safe and responsible manner.  We follow a corporate philosophy that the \"goal is zero.\"  This means we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  We have programs, procedures and management practices in place to support this goal of zero.  We constantly assess our progress against this goal of zero and take corrective actions to get back on track whenever necessary.\n\nOur primary focus is on prevention of any accidental releases.  However, we have strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  We use this combination of prevention programs and emergency response capability to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as pr"

This industrial park is located on Highway 347 in Beaumont, Texas. Our facility at the Beaumont Industrial Park presently employs 84 people who live and work in Jefferson County and vicinity.  The Hypalon\u00ae Unit located at the site has been in operation since 1957, producing high performance products.  \n\nDuPont Performance Elastomers Hypalon\u00ae Unit has been handling toxic substances at this site for over 40 years.  The long life and diversity of our operations means we have vast experience in operating processes in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nIn our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: Chlorine, Chloroform and Sulfur Dioxide.  \n\nOther chem"

These chemicals include: carbon tetrachloride and sulfuryl chloride.\n\nKey Off-Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nTo help with understanding the potential impact on the community due to a release of chemicals from DuPont Performance Elastomers Hypalon\u00ae Unit, we have provided information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios for our facility.   \n\nThese scenarios were developed using the guidance and technical data supplied by the EPA.  Scenario information similar to that described below has been used for many years as part of our process safety management program.  In the past we have modeled potential releases and analyzed the results to help us continuously improve our processes and reduce risk.  We continue to do these assessments as part of our internal process safety management systems.\n\nThe EPA defines the worst case scenario as a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical.  The scenario assumes the entire quantity is released in ten minutes, even if it is impossible to do so.  The worst case scenario underscores the need for very rigorous process safety management systems.  It is important to note however, that none of the prevention and mitigation equipment, practices, and procedures that have been put in place by DuPont Performance Elastomers to prevent or respond to releases such as these are taken into account for these worst case scenarios.  \n\nSince the worst case scenarios are so very improbable, they are not good cases to focus on for emergency response planning with the local community.   In order to facilitate emergency response planning with the community, the EPA has included the requirement for companies to report alternate case scenarios.  These alternate case scenarios provide a more realistic pic"

This is because the impact of a flammable scenario on the public is expected to be similar for all the different types of flammables.   The toxic chemicals can vary in their effects and so must be reviewed individually.  In the data elements section of this report you will find a detailed description of all these alternate release scenarios.\n\nThe largest and most significant toxic alternate case scenario for DuPont Performance Elastomers Hypalon\u00ae Unit is a release which would not leave the Beaumont Industrial Park site.   Although it would impact our employees or others inside the Industrial Park boundaries, it would not impact areas where the public has access.  Of course, we have accident prevention activities in place to protect our employees and Industrial Park personnel from injury.\n\nDuPont Performance Elastomers has many things in place to prevent releases from ever occurring.  The next section summarizes our release prevention activities.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe concepts of accidental release prevention and process safety management have been intrinsic to DuPont Performance Elastomers since its formation.   Site practices that incorporate these concepts include the following:\n \no    A thorough understanding of our process technology including the safe limits of the processes and the  \n      proper materials of construction for equipment;\no    Proper design and installation of equipment;\no    Systematic process hazard review studies to identify and manage process hazards;\no    Written operating and maintenance procedures;\no    Extensive training for all individuals involved in operating or maintaining a chemical process;\no    Mechanical integrity testing and preventive maintenance to detect potential eq"

The Beaumont Industrial Park has an on-site emergency response team, staffed 24 hours a day.   The emergency responders are thoroughly trained and properly equipped to respond to releases of any chemicals used on the site.  Each operating area in the Beaumont Industrial Park has developed an Emergency Response Plan.  These plans include steps to contain, control, and terminate any release of hazardous materials and bring under control any resulting fires or explosions.   Some of the elements of the plan include:\n\n\u00b7 Emergency shutdown procedures;\n\u00b7 Activation of the Emergency Response Team (ERT);\n\u00b7 Activation of emergency systems such as fire suppression systems;\n\u00b7 Activation of emergency repair procedures or services;\n\u00b7 Shutdown of adjacent facilities as appropriate;\n\u00b7 Barricading of affected facilities or roadways, if needed, and;\n\u00b7 Activation of spill containment and clean up procedures.\n\nWhere appropriate, the plan provides for interfacing with local community response organizations using guidelines established in Beaumont Industrial Park's Responsible Care program.  These guidelines address the following:\n\n\u00b7 Activation of the Emergency Response Plan;\n\u00b7 Notification of affected personnel both on and off-site;\n\u00b7 Notification of appropriate regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7 Escape and evacuation plans and practices for affected personnel;\n\u00b7 Personnel Accounting;\n\u00b7 Rescue Operations and medical assistance.\n\nTo ensure prompt and efficient implementation of these plans, emergency drills are conducted at appropriate frequencies.  These drills include participation of local emergency response organizations."

      "SummaryText": "All personnel with assigned responsibilities in these plans receive special training, including initial and refresher training to fulfill the competency requirements of their specific function within the plan.\n\nThe Beaumont Industrial Park Master Disaster Plan provides guidelines for handling a major emergency or disaster at the site to minimize hazards to site personnel and neighboring communities.  The DuPont Performance Elastomers Area Plans serve as a supplement to this Plan.  The safety of plant personnel and neighbors will take precedence over all other considerations in these plans.\n\nThe Beaumont Industrial Park operates the SAFER\u00ae System to track concentrations of releases that may move off-site.  Specially trained personnel are available on a 24-hour basis to provide guidance to the Emergency Director.  This guidance can be used to determine if off-site personnel should be notified and the extent of the potential hazard.\n\nIn addition to these on-site activities, the Beaumont Industrial Park also maintains transportation emergency response capability, which allows the site to respond to chemical transportation incidents outside the site.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of our process hazards review procedures, all of our higher hazard processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.  As a result of these studies, the following risk reduction activities have been implemented:\n\n\u00b7 Piping improvements including additional isolation and drain valves to improve the operation;\n\u00b7 Improving the control of the process by installing better instrumentation, more automatic process  \n  shutdown interlocks, and upgraded computer control systems;\n\u00b7 Improving preventive maintenance inspections and procedures;\n\u00b7 Improving training programs; and \n\u00b7 Conducting process safety audits to identify any deficiencies in our management systems.\n\n\nRMP Data Elements\n\nThe following pages contain more detailed information on the t"
