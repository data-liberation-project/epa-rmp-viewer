If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Platte County Fire Dept. and request their assistance.\nThis facilty is a swine finisher facilty.  We use propane on the farm for heating purposes.  There is one 30,000 gallon propane tank and associated piping, valves, burners, and other miscellaneous equipment.\nOur worst case scenario is failure of the storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to te endpoint is .4 miles.  Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccopied are, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\nThe propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFDA - 58 and state law.\nWe have had no accidents involving propane.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Platte County Fire Dept."
