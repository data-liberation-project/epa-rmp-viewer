Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, IO Data Centers, Phoenix Facility is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of IO Data Centers, Phoenix Facility\u00bfs high degree of commitment to public safety and service, IO Data Centers, Phoenix Facility is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\n2.

The emergency response program\r\n\r\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  IO Data Centers, Phoenix Facility has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  IO Data Centers, Phoenix Facility conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.
