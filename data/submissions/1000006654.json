      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\nCox Creek Water Reclamation Facility\nThe Anne Arundel County Cox Creek Water Reclamation Facility (CCWRF) located in Curtis Bay, Maryland is designed to treat up to 15 million gallons per day of domestic wastewater.  The CCWRF treats wastewater from over 110,000 people in Anne Arundel County.  The facility is designed to remove pollutants from wastewater before discharging the treated wastewater into the Patapsco River.  As part of this treatment system, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used to effect disinfection and dechlorination, respectively.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored at the facility in one-ton cylinders.  Disinfection and dechlorination are common processes used by many wastewater treatment plants in the United States.\nAnne Arundel County Department of Public Works personnel have designed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to ensure safe operation of the disinfection and dechlorination processes.  As part of the PSM program, a process hazards analysis has been conducted to evaluate the safety of each process.  The minimum amount of chemicals required to meet the facilityA?s discharge permit parameters is stored in enclosed brick buildings.  Standard operating procedures have been written for the safe handling of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders.  Annual training is provided to facility personnel in safe handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and a strict preventive maintenance program has been implemented for each process.  Monitors are installed in the buildings to detect any leaks.  If a  leak is detected, building ventilation systems cut off automatically preventing any chemical from escaping from the storage buildings.  In the event of a leak Anne Arundel County Fire Department Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) unit is contacted and, if necessary, they will slowly and safely mitigate the situation under controlled conditions.  No releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide "

      "SummaryText": "have occurred at the facility resulting in any off-site impacts. Plant now has a third source of power (generators)for backup. There are now locks on the building,as well as, the hoist.\n Coordination between the Anne Arundel County Fire Department HAZMAT unit and the facility personnel enhances and ensures safe facility operation as well as emergency response to any chemical situation.  The interagency relationship between the HAZMAT unit and the CCWRF personnel has fostered open communication and coordination of emergency response procedures and the safe handling and storage practices for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  In addition, HAZMAT unit personnel were directly involved in development of this Risk Management Plan for the CCWRF, both in conducting release scenario modeling and with providing input to the emergency response program at the facility.  Through this cooperative effort and the ongoing process safety management procedures at the facility, Anne Arundel County will continue to operate the Cox  Creek Water Reclamation Facility in an environmentally safe manner."
