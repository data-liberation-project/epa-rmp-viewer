The purpose of this Plan is to help prevent or minimize risk of exposure to chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas for both employees of the Facility and also the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAccidental releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide are prevented through the use of standardized procedures recommended by the manufacturer.  Only the chlorine and sulfur dioxide supplier will install or remove chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers at the facility.  Plant personnel have been trained in procedures regarding the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems operate under a vacuum to minimize the potential for release.\n\nThe Facility has implemented written procedures in compliance with the RMP regulations to help minimize the risk of a chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide release. The revised RMP Manual outlines training requirements, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, emergency response policies and defines responsible persons for implementing the aspects of the Plan. The RMP Manual will continue to provide guidance for the Facility's day-to-day operation, thereby creating a safer and more effective work environment.\n\n\n\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe City of Katy Waste Water Treatment Plant has the capacity to treat an average of 3.4 million gallons of wastewater per day. The plant utilizes chlorine gas as a disinfectant and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination. During normal operations, the Facility may have up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine and 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide stored at the site. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in 2,000-pound containers (1-ton).\n\nThe Facility is required to create a Risk Management Plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide in compliance with "
