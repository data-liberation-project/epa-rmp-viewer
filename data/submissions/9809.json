The system consist of three (3) propane tanks with the largest being 5,000-gallons with associated piping, valves, burners, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario: Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 5,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% @ 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the greatest distance to the endpoint is 0.2 miles. This explosion would only have an effect on the client population served by our facility at the endpoint, with a total population of 200.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and che"
