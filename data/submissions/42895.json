Hydrogen is currently stored in two separate locations within the facility.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted on a five year schedule by the Process Hazard Analysis Team.  The PHA team is comprised of Gas Engineer (team leader), Safety representative for gases, Gas Technician, manufacturing representatives from site manufacturing organizations, Emergency Control representative, and an engineer from Air Products (Vendor).  The results are recorded and maintained on file.\n\nOperating procedures were written by the Gas Engineer using technical process descriptions and process safety information, and with input from the involved employees.  Operating procedures, as specified in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Documentation for the Hydrogen System, are available from Site Systems Engineering (D/20G) and Utility Plant and Bulk Gas operations (D/88B).  The operating procedures are documented as Bulk Gas Procedures or as Desk References, and are available in B/316. \n\nTraining is formulated and tracked by the Gas Engineer and training records are maintained by D/20G and D/88B managers.\n\nMechanical Integrity is shared between the gas supplier and IBM.  The program consists of equipment lists and specifications, equipment history, and preventative maintenance procedures.\n\nHot work permits for work on the  hydrogen system are issued by IBM (Emergency Control) or Air Products.  This permit issuing process includes a safety inspection of  the area.\n\nQuality assurance of the Management of Change (MOC) "
