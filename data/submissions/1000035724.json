The Facility Policy\n\n               The management and employees of Crystal Valley Co-op are committed to the prevention of any\n\n               accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \n\n               prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and to\n\n               minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n          2.  Facility Information\n\n               The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n               Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application to farmers. Anhydrous\n\n               ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. The maximum quantity stored would be 130,000\n\n               lbs. in our storage tank and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading\n\n               of a truck tank holding 40,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n          3.  \"Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case \n\n                scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security sensitive information\n\n                as requested by EPA.\"\n\n\n\n           4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n               The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\n\n               of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and\n\n               the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR \n\n               1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n\n\n           5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\n                There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years: That have\n\n                caused and deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor to our knowl"
