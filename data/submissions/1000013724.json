Knead Dough Bakery, Inc. administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPAA?s Risk Management Program (RMP). These programs include employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations. These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nKnead Dough Bakery, Inc. is located at 556 St. James Gate, in Bolingbrook, Illinois. The systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The facility's two systems use a total of 14,800 pounds of ammonia. System one uses 5,000 pounds while system two uses 9,800 pounds. The system equipment is located both inside and outside the Engine Rooms while the condensers are located on the roof.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Knead Dough Bakery, Inc. ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  \n\nPolicies and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.

Other safety features include ammonia sensors that sound a facility wide alarm, an emergency shutdown button that kills power to the engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and ventilation in the engine rooms to prevent ammonia explosions. \n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on the industry standard: the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, A?Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used at the facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Knead Dough Bakery, Inc. facilityA?s accident history revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (April 2005 through April 2010) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or A?near missesA? that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nKnead Dough Bakery, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n1) Save lives;\n2) Minimize and avoid injuries;\n3) Protect the environment; and\n4) Minimize property damage.\n\nKnead Dough Bakery, Inc. maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.
