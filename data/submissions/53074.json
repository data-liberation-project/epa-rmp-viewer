The Gateway Generating Station uses aqueous ammonia to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  As the company responsible for operating Gateway Generating Station, PG&E takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia seriously.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPG&E\u00bfs vision is to be the leading utility in the United States and PG&E\u00bfs values are presented below:\n\nWe act with integrity and communicate honestly and openly. \nWe are passionate about meeting our customers\u00bf needs and delivering for our shareholders.\nWe are accountable for all of our own actions; these include safety, protecting the environment and supporting our communities.\nWe work together as a team and are committed to excellence and innovation.\nWe respect each other and celebrate our diversity.\n\nThe Gateway Generating Station accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nAs a supplier of energy to approximately five percent of Americans and more than 40 percent of Californians, we recognize that the choices we make about the way we produce and deliver our products and serve our customers can have a direct impact on the environment.

The river borders the north side, while a recreational marina, open space and additional industrial land uses occur east of the site.  \n\nThe Gateway Generating Station combined cycle power unit consists of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), and one steam turbine generator. In the combined cycle process, electricity is generated from the combustion turbines and the steam turbine. Each combustion turbine generator converts the thermal energy of the natural gas fuel to mechanical energy, which drives the electrical generator. At the same time, the thermal energy from the exhaust flue gas off the combustion turbines is directed to the HRSGs to convert pressurized water into steam, which turns the steam turbine to drive the electricity generator. The facility also include two 195-foot tall exhaust stacks on the heat recovery steam generators, one air cool condenser system, a wet surface air cooler, an inlet chiller system, storage tanks, a control building, electrical power transformers, and transmission facilities to interconnect the generated electricity to the power grid. \n\nAqueous ammonia is used at PG&E\u00bfs Gateway Generating Station in the plant\u00bfs selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce Nox emissions.  Up to 18,020 gallons of aqueous ammonia solution (39,681 lbs of ammonia in solution) may be present in the process at any time.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia stored at Gateway Generating Station exceeds the federal RMP and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 20,000 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP and CalARP regulations.
