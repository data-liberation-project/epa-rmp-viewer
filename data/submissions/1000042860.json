The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nOwensboro Specialty Polymers maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Some examples of the process safety information included Safety Data Sheets (SDS) on all raw materials and products, Equipment Specification Sheets, and Process Instrumentation and Design drawings (P&ID).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist and Whatif.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of not greater than five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on 12-11-2012\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Owensboro Specialty Polymers maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nOwensboro Specialty Polymers has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more "
