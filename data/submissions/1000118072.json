      "SummaryText": "FEBRUARY 2025 GENERAL EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR CORTEVA AGRISCIENCE, LLC MIDLAND OPERATIONS\n\nREVISIONS TO THE PLAN\n\nRevisions to the December 2nd, 2022 plan are being submitted on February 28, 2025 for the following reasons:\n\nREMOVAL OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nRemoved Chlorine from 954 since the plant no longer supplies this chemical to other facilities on-site through the site distribution piping system. The 954 plant has blown out all the piping for the site distribution system and disconnected it from each facility they supplied Chlorine to. The Chlorine system equipment within 954s block limits has been cleaned and opened to atmosphere. The remaining partial railcar of Chlorine was sent off-site on 9/10/24. Due to the removal of this chemical, 954 is no longer subject to RMP regulations.\n\nRemoved Sulfur Dioxide, Crotonaldehyde and Anhydrous Ammonia from 827, as that plant/process has been shut down permanently.  The plant removed all Crotonaldehyde from their block limits on 8/30/24, removed all Sulfur Dioxide from their block limits on 9/11/24 and Anhydrous Ammonia was decreased below the threshold limit on 9/18/24. All associated equipment for these chemicals has been cleaned. Due to the removal of these three chemicals, the 827 plant is no longer subject to RMP regulations.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCorteva Agriscience, LLC Midland Operations is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland"

There are two (2) covered processes, two (2) programs and two (2) regulated substances present at the stationary source. \n\nThe regulated substances are listed below.  \n- Ammonia (water solution \u0096 30%)\n- Dimethylamine\n\n\nWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO SELECTION\n\nThere was one (1) worst case toxic and one (1) worst case flammable scenario reported in this submittal. There are two (2) total alternate cases reported, one of which is a flammable case.  The toxic alternate case scenario reported is an Ammonia (water solution - 30%) release from the 1200 plant, since this is the only regulated toxic RMP chemical that the site uses. The flammable alternate case scenario reported is a Dimethylamine release from the 489 plant, since this is the only regulated flammable RMP chemical that the site uses. EPA RMP*Comp and MARPLOT were used to evaluate the worst and alternate case scenarios. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROTECTION PROGRAM\n\nCorteva Agriscience, LLC Midland Operations has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
