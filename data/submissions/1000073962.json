      "SummaryText": "1. Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\r\nOCEC is dedicated to the protection of its employees from emergencies such as hazardous weather, explosions, chemical spills and fires. If an emergency or natural disaster occurs the emergency action plan (EAP) will be initiated. The EAP is in place to ensure employee safety from emergencies during regular hours and after hours. It provides a written document detailing and organizing the actions and procedures to be followed by employees in case of a workplace emergency. \r\n\r\n2. Description of Stationary Source\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia at OCEC will be used to supply the SCR system, which will be installed to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted during the combustion of natural gas.  NOx reduction is necessary to meet ozone ambient air quality standards and technology-based air permit limits.  The SCR process involves the injection of ammonia into the flue gas that then passes through a catalyst bed of titanium dioxide, tungsten oxide, and vanadium pentoxide in which ammonia and NOx react, yielding harmless nitrogen and water vapor leaving the stack.  This system ensures that NOx emissions are not greater than 3.5 parts per million (ppm).\r\nAt OCEC, anhydrous ammonia will be stored in six pressure vessels rated for 350 pounds per square inch (psi) maximum allowable working pressure.  Each ammonia storage vessel will be filled to only 85 percent of its capacity as an administrative control.  The 85% fill limit is an industry standard practice to provide head space in the tanks during warm weather when the ammonia expands.  When filled to the 85 percent level, each vessel will hold approximately 5,000 gallons, or 25,800 pounds, of anhydrous ammonia.  Under normal operating conditions, liquefied anhydrous ammonia will flow from one of the storage vessels to one of two vaporizers as a result of the pressure differential between the storage vessel and the vaporizers.  The vaporizers will convert the liquefied ammonia to"

      "SummaryText": "vapor by means of two electric heating elements and then return the vapor to the storage vessel to help maintain a pressure of at least 100 psi in the vessel.  Four dilution air blowers (two per heat recovery steam generator) will create a stream of air into which ammonia vapor will be injected.  The ammonia/air mixture will then flow into the Ammonia Injection Grids (AIGs).  The flow of ammonia vapor will be controlled automatically by the Distributed Control System, which will use the information provided by in-line flue gas analyzers to adjust the Flow Control Valve as needed to supply the appropriate ammonia/air concentration to the AIGs.  The ammonia storage area is equipped with ammonia detectors that will alarm in the control room and locally if ammonia is released, as well as a deluge system.\r\n\r\n3. Prevention Program\r\nTo comply with the RMP/PSM Rule, OCEC has developed an RMP/PSM program for the process involving all aspects of the OCEC ammonia process operation, including operations, maintenance, safety and training.\r\nThe RMP program will also serve as the Prevention Program required by the PSM Rule.\r\n\r\n4. Accident History \r\nThe OCEC facility has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n If an emergency or natural disaster occurs the emergency action plan (EAP) will be initiated.  The EAP includes information on Roles and Responsibilities, Site Emergency Response Procedures, Site Emergency Evacuation Procedures, an Ammonia Release Plan, Fire, Severe Weather, and Hurricane Preparedness.\r\nThe plan communicates to employees the policies, procedures, and practices to follow in emergencies. This written plan is available, upon request, to employees, their designated representatives, and any regulatory officials who ask to see it. In the event of an ammonia release, emergency notification is made locally by dialing 9-1-1 and requesting the HAZMAT team be dispatched to the site."
