      "SummaryText": "The receipt, storage and conveyance of anhydrous ammonia is the single hazardous process at the Santee Cooper - Cross Generating Station (CGS) facility.  This determination is based upon Federal and State process safety and process management (PS/PM) regulations and Santee Cooper CGS\u2019s standards.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site via tanker truck and is stored in a series of twelve (12) above ground storage tanks.  Each tank has a nominal capacity of 30,000 gallons, with an actual maximum design capacity of 24,600 gallons.  CGS no longer receives anhydrous ammonia via railcar.  The total storage capacity of all anhydrous ammonia stored at the facility is 360,000 gallons (1,771,560 pounds).\n\nThis process (receipt, storage, and conveyance) is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.  A recent Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was completed in April 2023. Under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G Risk Management Plan, CGS is subject to Program 3 because the process is subject to OSHA PSM and the OCA\u2019s worst-case included various public receptors.  The Santee Cooper Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard, consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirement for this facility under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nChanges in this submittal from the previous submittal include the following: using EPA RMP\u2019s Comp modeling software to complete both worst-case and alternate scenarios and changing the topography setting from urban to rural to align more closely with the terrain around the CGS facility.  In doing so, the distance to the endpoint increased along with the populations for both scenarios; the worst-case scenario increased from 2.9 miles to 5.6 miles, the alternate scenario increased from 0.5 mile to 1.8 miles."
