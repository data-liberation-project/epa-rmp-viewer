The ICP format will minimize duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response and risk management plans for various regulatory requirements, and will eliminate confusion for Central WWTP staff that may have to decide which plan applies to a particular emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n- Install a level sensor for the scrubber solution.\n\n- Install an automatic shut mechanism on the exterior doors of the Chlorine Building and the Sulfur Dioxide Building.\n\n- Develop a replacement schedule for the pressure relief valves.\n\n- Upgrade the sulfur dioxide scrubber system to have enough capacity to scrub an entire tank."

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe City of Dallas Water Utilities maintains a policy of safe water and wastewater treatment plant operation, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the treatment processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, their employees, and the environment. They cooperate with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote effective contingency planning in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs.\n\nAs part of this policy, Dallas Water Utilities maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\nThe Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The amounts stored for both chemicals exceed the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  Dallas Water Utilities first submitted a RMP for the Central WWTP to USEPA in 1999.  RMPs must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  The following information summarizes the Central WWTP 2004 update and resubmission:\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Central Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the wastewater treatment process.  Sulfur dioxide is used at the plant in the dechlorination process to remove residual chlorine from the treated wastewater prior to discharge into the Trinity River.  \n\n1. Chlorine\nThe Central WWTP regularly has a maximum storage quantity of 401 tons of chlorine at its facility.  The chlorine is stored in two Department of Transportation certified 90-ton ra"

The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA \n\nThe majority of chlorine is delivered to the Central WWTP by railroad on rail spurs and is stored in the two 90-ton railroad tank cars.  A chlorine tanker truck supplies chlorine for the emergency tank, when necessary.  The rail cars and the tank are located inside the Chlorine Building.\n\nThe existing chlorine feed facilities at the Central WWTP consist of inside storage tanks (two 90-ton rail cars and a 30 ton stationary tank), liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, two evaporators, gas piping and miscellaneous valves, four chlorinators, and a scrubber system.  A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\n2. Sulfur dioxide\nThe Central WWTP stores sulfur dioxide in two 30-ton stationary tanks.  As an administrative control, these tanks are only filled with a maximum of 55,000 pounds.  Therefore, the maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored onsite at one time is approximately 110,000 pounds.  The total amount exceeds the threshold limit of 5,000 pounds set by EPA.\n\nSulfur dioxide is delivered to the Central WWTP by a tanker truck and is stored in tanks located inside the Sulfur Dioxide Building.  \n\nThe existing sulfur dioxide facilities at the Central WWTP consist of the two 30-ton stationary tanks, liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves, two evaporators, gas piping and miscellaneous valves, and feeders.  A release of sulfur dioxide gas could potentially occur at the sulfur dioxide storage area or at the sulfur dioxide process areas.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIn May 2004, Dallas Water Utilities and Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. reviewed and updated the offsite consequence analyses at Central WWTP.   Safety information and hazard analysis documentation were reviewed to determine whether the parameters and assum"

Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Central WWTP was reviewed for the period from June 1999 through June 2004.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Dallas Water Utilities maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at Central WWTP.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n1. Safety Information\nDallas Water Utilities has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at Central WWTP.  The information is made available to employees and contractors at Central WWTP who will work in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n2. Hazard Review\nA hazard review of chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  A chlorine and sulfur dioxide hazard review using the \u00bfWhat-If\u00bf method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. with the assistance of Central WWTP plant management and staff familiar with the process\u00bf operation and maintenance in May, 2004.  The results of this review identified changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. The changes that most effectively help prevent an accidental release"

Operating procedures\nDallas Water Utilities have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and steps for conducting activities associated with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at Central WWTP consistent with the safety information. Central WWTP operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. Training\nAll Central WWTP staff currently involved in chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Central WWTP staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\n5. Maintenance\nCentral WWTP has developed and implemented a preventive and corrective maintenance program to ensure equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide is functioning properly and installed to minimize the risk of releases.   The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n6. Compliance audits\nUSEPA\u00bfs risk management rule requires that Central WWTP complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety practices"

The results of this audit, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. \n\n7. Incident Investigation\nCentral WWTP management investigates each incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Central WWTP risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for Central WWTP, which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide to ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  These procedures include leak investigation, operational-level response activities, and communications to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas Fire Department HAZMAT Team, in the event of an emergency. \n\nIn 2004, the Dallas Water Utilities will update and incorporate this ERP, as well as sections of the risk management program, into an \u00bfall-ha"
