If anccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizer for crop production.\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 140,800 pounds divided between one-18000 gallon storage tank and one-12000 gallon storage tank with all tanks being filled to 85%capacity. The worse case release scenario would be a release of 79,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, over a ten minute period and has the potential to affect 20 people. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion at 200PPM) is 1.89 miles. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200PPM) is .83 miles affecting 5 people.\n\nOur plant is maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations. The employees who work at the facility are trained once a year on the proper procedures to operate the plant as well as the procedures to fill a nurse tank. Our workers always have safety water on hand and the proper personal protective equipment (gloves and goggles) during ammonia operations. Planned changes to improve safety will be dictated by the requirements of the Kansas Department of Agriculture. \n\nThe emergency respone plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public and area emergency responders. Our companies emergency respone plan is shared with the local fire department and the county LEPC. First responders will be provided a tour of the facility and in return they have agreed to assist the coop in the event of an emergency or accidental release."
