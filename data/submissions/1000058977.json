              "Description": "Nufarm has implemented has implemented a Process Safety and Risk Management Manual(PSRM) and an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prevent the accidental release of process chemicals and to mitigate the consequences of a release. \n\n\n\nThe PSRM follows the fourteen elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) and the same procedures apply to both covered processes at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe procedures are as follow: \n\n- Applicability (PSRM-01)\n\n- Employee Participation (PSRM-02)\n\n- Process Safety Information (PSRM-03)\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis(PSRM-04)\n\n- Operating Procedures(PSRM-05)\n\n- Training (PSRM-06)\n\n- Contractors (PSRM-07)\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSRM-08)\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (PSRM-09)\n\n- Hot Work (PSRM-10)\n\n- Management of Change (PSRM-11)\n\n- Incident Investigation (PSRM-12)\n\n- Emergency Planning and Response(PSRM-13)\n\n- Compliance Audits (PSRM-14)\n\n- Management System (PSRM-15)\n\n- Hazard Assessment (PSRM-16)\n\n- Risk Management Plan (PSRM-17)\n\n- Trade Secrets (PSRM-18)\n\n\n\nPSRM-03 addresses safe operating limits and PSRM-09 addresses preventative maintenance and inspection schedules for the process equipment in both covered processes at the facility. \n\n\n\nManagement of change (MOC) reviews are conducted for changes to the covered processes and equipment in accordance with PSRM-11. Major changes require a MOC process hazard analysis (PHA) and pre-startup safety review (PSSR) in accordance with PSRM-04 and PSRM-08.  \n\n\n\nThe ICP outlines the actions to be taken for all types of emergency situations (i.e., natural disasters, fires, explosions, spills, etc.) and the types of evacuation to be used in these emergency circumstances.",

      "SummaryText": "Nufarm Americas, Inc. (Nufarm) located in Chicago Heights, Illinois manufactures water-based herbicides using Dimethylamine (DMA), Mono-isopropylamine (MIPA), and Ammonium Hydroxide as the main reactants. MIPA and DMA are flammable liquids and are PSM- and RMP-covered processes. Ammonium hydroxide was previously included in the RMP (as ammonia), but the volume has decreased and ammonium hydroxide (CAS No. 1336-21-6) is not a covered process.\n\n\n\nMIPA is used in solution and is delivered to the facility via rail cars and transferred to storage tanks located within a protected tank farm. MIPA is distributed to process reactors in the process plant via pumps and process piping for glyphosate production. DMA is used in solution and is delivered to the facility via rail car and transferred to storage tanks located within a protected tank farm. DMA is distributed to amine reactors in the process plant via pumps and process piping. The reactors are connected to process scrubbers.  \n\n\n\nNufarm has implemented programs to comply with the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps as required by EPA. Nufarm has implemented a Process Safety and Risk Management Manual(PSRM) to prevent the accidental release of process chemicals and an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to mitigate the consequences of a release. The PSRM follows the fourteen elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). The same PSRM procedures apply to both covered processes at the facility. Management of change (MOC) reviews are conducted for changes to the covered processes and equipment and major changes require a MOC process hazard analysis (PHA) and pre-startup safety review (PSSR).\n\n\n\nNufarm is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  Nufarm coordinates all of the emergency response activities with the Cook County LEPC and Chicago Heights Fire Department.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nNufarm maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of the regulated substances, the technology of the processes, and the equipment in the processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nNufarm has performed process hazard analyses for the DMA and MIPA covered processes. These PHAs comply with 40 CFR 68.67.  The Nufarm site utilizes either a What-If or HazOp methodology to identify the hazards of the processes, to consider consequences of failure of administrative and engineering controls, and to evaluate safety and health effects of possible releases of regulated substances.   \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nNufarm has written operating procedures that provide instruction for safely operating covered processes.  These operating procedures are available to employees who work in the processes.  The procedures are reviewed annually and modified when needed to accommodate operational and process changes.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nNufarm provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees who operate the processes.  Training documentation provides records of when training was received and whether or not the training was understood.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nNufarm has a preventive maintenance program for maintaining the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  Maintenance employees receive training for maintenance activities.  Periodic inspection and testing are performed on process equipment and records are kept to document this inspection and testing.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nNufarm has a written procedure to document and manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Employees are notified of and provided training for changes to the process.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:\n\nNufarm performs pre-statup safety reviews for changes in a process that require modification to process safety information.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit:\n\nNufarm evaluates compliance with the provisions"

PHAs and all other RMP information are available to employees.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit:\n\nNufarm has a procedure for the issuance of hot work permits for hot work done on covered processes.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nNufarm hires contractors to perform maintenance and various other activities at their facility.  Nufarm reviews contractors' safety performance and programs and informs contractors of known potential hazards related to working at their site.  Nufarm maintains a program to control the entrance, presence, and exit from covered process areas.  Contractor performance is evaluated annually.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History:\n\nNo accidental release has occurred at the Nufarm Chicago Heights, IL facility that qualifies for the 5-year accident history.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nNufarm has developed an Emergency Response Plan and Integrated Contingency Plan which includes information for notifying offsite emergency responders of releases of DMA, MIPA, and non-covered processes such as ammonium hydroxide. Nufarm's Emergency Response/Action Plan relies on the Chicago Heights Fire Department for responding to hazardous material emergencies.\n\n\n\nAn engineering analysis of the suitability of the bulk storage tanks was conducted in October 2014. The last PHA revalidations for the MIPA and DMA processes were conducted in September 2017. The most recent triennial compliance audit was conducted in September 2017.
