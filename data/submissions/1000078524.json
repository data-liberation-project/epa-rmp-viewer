Policies in effect relate to operations  and maintenance of equipment, ongoing employee training, emergency response planning and coordination with appropriate local response agencies.  These policies are embodied in the Risk Management Plan and OSHA Process Safety Manual, which together provide the means to prevent or mitigate accidental releases.\n\n    The Greer CPW Water Plant is located off S.C. Highway 14 on River Road, north of the City of Greer.  This facility treats raw water from the South Tyger River to supply potable water for the City of Greer and surrounding areas.  The plant operates under SCDHEC System ID #23009.  Treatment processes include physical/chemical steps for solids settling and filtration, and chlorination for disinfection.\n\n    Facilities in place to accomplish chlorination include pumping and chlorinator equipment to introduce a chlorine solution into the water stream.  Chlorine for this process is stored on-site in ton cylinders.  Normal operations include two cylinders on-line, with up to twelve spares in reserve.  The on-line cylinders are manifolded together to a single vacuum regulator.\n\n    Chlorine is the only regulated substance maintained on-site in quantities above the regulated threshold limit.\n\n    The general accidental release prevention program is a multi-faceted effort configured to comply with both EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM rules.  Key elements include a high level of employee training, an aggressive equipment maintenance routine, detailed operation procedures, hazard reviews and management controls.\n\n    Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detection equipment.\n\n    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the"
