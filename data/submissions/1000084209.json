The program describes the analyses of hazards conducted to assess possible effects to employees, offsite public and environmental receptors, and equipment. Results of an offsite consequences analysis (OCA) to define sensitive receptors, defining of a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of the RS are detailed within the program.  The CalARP/RMP Program establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  A Gas Management System Response Plan is written and coordinated with local planning and response agencies.  \n\nIt is SRWTP policy that the production, storage, and handling of digester gas including methane, at its facility is compliant with regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of the RS to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nSRWTP, part of the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (District), is located at 8521 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA on 900 acres of a 3,400-acre site between Interstate 5 and Franklin Blvd., south of Cosumnes River Blvd.  The remaining 2,500 acres serve as a buffer between the Plant and nearby residential areas.  There are approximately 380 full-time employees at this site and multiple contractors on site for the EchoWater and other projects.  The Plant treats an average of 145 million gallons (mgd) of wastewater per day.  The solids removed in the "

      "SummaryText": "wastewater treatment process are introduced in up to 7 active anaerobic digesters and one blending digester at the Plant.  There are also 3 Battery 1 digesters permanently out of service and not included in the number of active digesters. Gas consisting of approximately two-thirds methane is formed in the digesters as bacterial digestion occurs.  The digester gas is scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants, may be stored in low pressure gas holders, and piped to the adjacent Carson Cogeneration Plant for power generation.  Any quantity of digester gas not used by the cogeneration plant is used in the Plant boiler room or flared under permit issued by the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District.  \n\n\n\nThe majority of the gas management system is equipped with multiple monitoring and detection devices for LEL, UV/IR and H2S detection. Some of these detectors are interlocked to plant emergency trip systems which will close gas or fire isolation valves.  All sensors alarm to the Plant Control Center and locally to the Area Control Center.  Tanks and scrubbers are typically equipped with pressure and vacuum relief devices commonly referred to as Varecs. \n\n\n\nThe entire gas holding capacity of the digester system in the Plant is considered for the purpose of this program applicability.  At any given time, Regional San may have up to 46,000 pounds of digester gas on site.  Regional San is a Program Level 1 for digester gas because:\n\n?    there have been no accidental release where exposure to methane, its reaction products, or overpressure generated by an explosion of methane or radiant heat generated by a fire involving methane has led to offsite consequences resulting in death, injury, or response/restoration activities for exposure of an environmental or public  receptor;\n\n?    the distance to flammable endpoint for a worst case release assessment is less than the distance to any public receptor; and\n\n?    emergency procedures related to methane h"

      "SummaryText": "ave been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs are categorized as administrative (management), procedural, training, engineering controls, and emergency response programs.  \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to the Gas Management System (GMS) have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, use of Plant Emergency Trip Systems (PETs) to isolate the majority of the digester gas system during an emergency thereby limiting the possibility of explosion or fire. There are also redundant processes and isolation points in the gas management system, and numerous facility-specific operational procedures for covered process systems.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThere have been no accidents involving digester gas at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nStaff from: Management, Plant Control Center (PCC), Shift Operations, and Area Operations have been trained in the Incident Command System (ICS).  SRWTP maintains emergency response procedures (without fire fighting) in the digester gas management area.  Emergency Response Procedures have been developed in cooperation with Cosumnes Fire Department. The plans have also been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSRWTP continuously strives towards improvements and mitigation measures in the covered process area. Regional San continues to coordinate with the Sacramento County CUPA and make appropriate improvements for better safety at the plant. Planned safety changes include operational procedure and practice change(s) to improve and to minimize the presence or accumulation of digester gas within the gas management system. \n\n"
