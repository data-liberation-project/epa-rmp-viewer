      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nSundale Cold Storage expanded the North cold storage in 2017. The largest vessel is inside the mechanical room and the same size as in the south, which does not produce a longer distance to toxic endpoint (DTE). The South refrigeration system has a larger total inventory with 3 large vessels outside and adjacent to the mechanical room, one of which produces the largest DTE. \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program at Sundale Cold Storage complies with California Accidental Release Prevention (CAL ARP) and Federal RM program requirements. This facility processes, packs and stores fruit as Agricultural post harvest processing consistent with SIC Code 0723 on a seasonal basis.\r\n\r\nWe  are a Program 3 with inventories of each separate facility greater than 10,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant in closed loop refrigeration systems. \r\n\r\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40).\r\n \r\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Sundale Cold Storage is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. We have a State-of-the-art refrigeration process with Diffusion tanks, Ammonia detection, emergency ventilation and alarm paging/notification. Our facility is fenced, has video surveillance and is monitored by a refrigeration control system continuously.\r\n\r\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass table grape, packing and storage.  We have 1 regulated substance above thr"

      "SummaryText": "eshold quantities present at our facility in 2 separate Cold Storage buildings separated by a large parking lot.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) used for a refrigerant. We have inventories greater than 10,000 lbs. requiring compliance as Program 3 level.\r\n\r\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote dialogue. According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \u00bfThe worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst and alternate case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMPComp software.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest external high-pressure receiver (vessel). In this scenario Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the largest external vessel at the maximum storage capacity of 100%.  In typical operation only 10-20% of this amount is present at one time in all of the receivers. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability, urban location due to trees/orchards in the area providing obstacles and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  Population estimates for the entire area is included in the study. Actual number affected by a worst case release"

      "SummaryText": "is only 10% of this amount that would be in the plume footprint. The plume footprint is an oblong area starting at the release point getting the widest \u00bd the distance to the toxic endpoint and then narrowing again.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a compressor shaft seal failure.  The scenario involves the release of 270 lb. of   Toxic vapor was released with no mitigation. The release is stopped after 30 minutes by manual isolation.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is < .1 miles. Actual distances less than .1 mile is recorded as .1 miles. No public receptors are in the distance to toxic endpoint. In this release it would just reach the property boundary as required. \r\n\r\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The newest North facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the 2013 California Mechanical and Fire Codes.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nSundale Vineyards maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely m"

      "SummaryText": "prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nSundale Cold Storage promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n5.Five-year Accident History\r\nSundale Cold Storage has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\n6.Emergency Response Plan\r\nSundale Cold Storage employees will not enter a hazardous area. Only defensive mitigation actions will be performed along with evacuation and notifications with local, State and Federal Agencies as needed for support and reporting.  We have a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials and have coordinated with local fire and county officials. Our emergency notification and safety equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. County of Tulare is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program at the North and South Cold Storage.   We have used stainless steel piping and components to reduce corrosion potential, we are cleaning and treating corrosion and will be adding better signs for alarms. These are being done to comply with new RAGAGEP recommendations."
