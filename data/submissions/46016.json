      "SummaryText": "Windsor Foods' primary business is processing, preparation, and wholesale distribution of meat products (chicken, turkey, pork, and beef) for human consumption.  The facility is located at 601 East Third Street, Lampasas, Texas 76550.  The SIC code for the operation is 2013; the NAICS code is 311612.  The facility employees approximately 250 persons.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, five days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh and preserve food safety standards.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe operating capacity of the system is approximately 35,800 pounds.  The system is a two-stage refrigeration cycle and is used to cool and freeze raw materials and prepared food products.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program is implemented to meet the RMP Program Level 3 prevention plan requirements.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses"

      "SummaryText": ", management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions stated in the facility's plan.\n\nThe system is frequently monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation daily.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours apart.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with ammonia detectors in the engine rooms that alarm when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels.  \n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic drills.  \n\nThe facility has not experienced an ammonia release in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's emergency action plan includes"
