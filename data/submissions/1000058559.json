Additionally, during a recent internal audit, it was discovered that the overall structure of this plan was incorrect.  Only one program level can apply to a process, and the previous version had one process with multiple programs (although all listed as Program Level 3).  The content is the same, there are no new covered processes, but the previous several programs have all been combined under one to better match the intent of the regulation.  The plan is now simply one process (consisting of several co-located and interconnected units) with one program level.  Clarification has also been added to the program description to include major unloading/loading areas, which have always been considered part of the covered process, but not explicitly identified in previous submissions.  Maximum intended inventories have been updated, but the adjustments did not impact any worst case or alternate case scenarios.\r\n \r\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies - Huntsman Conroe Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally responsible work place for its employees and neighbors.  The Huntsman Conroe Site maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program that implements a series of steps to control potential hazards associated with the processes and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with on-site procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Conroe Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety.

If any hot work is performed near a covered process, Huntsman Conroe Plant issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.  Hot Work Permits are kept on file until the work is complete.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\nHuntsman Conroe Plant has developed procedures for selecting and ensuring that contractors are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work.  Huntsman Conroe Plant provides information to them about the hazards that may be present in the work area and has developed appropriate safe work practices.  Huntsman Conroe Plant also evaluates the safety performance and programs of the contractors as a part of their continued employment.\r\n\r\n4.    5 Year Accident History\r\nHuntsman Conroe Plant has not had any reportable accidents in the last five years.\r\n\r\n5.
