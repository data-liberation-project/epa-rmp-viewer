This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance safe work practices are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent the recurrence of an incident.\n-\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements with any action items tracked to completion. \n-\tAn annual dialogue with the Martin County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) will ensure a readiness to respond to potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops."

There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  \n\nWTG has determined that the gas plant should be considered one process under the RMP rule.  This facility has one process (as defined by the regulation) consisting of a flammable mixture and propane.  Although the systems containing the flammable mixture and the propane are not interconnected, an incident in one of the systems could trigger a release in the other system, therefore, the two systems are to be considered one process.\n\nWTG has determined that SRGP is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the RMP regulation because the nearest public receptor is within the worst-case scenario flammable endpoint radius and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by WTG.  These high standards include:\n\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe SRGP is operating under a prevention program that involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chem"

WTG\u2019s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, and emergency response in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and continuous improvement efforts to improve safety at the facility.\n\nNon-Responding Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWTG owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Stanton, Texas.  The Sale Ranch Gas Plant (SRGP) compresses and treats natural gas to produce residue gas (methane) and natural gas liquids (NGL).  After processing, the residue gas and NGL exit the plant via product pipelines.  \n\nPre-treated, sweet field gas enters the plant via a pipeline, is dehydrated, and sent to the NGL recovery plant.  At the recovery plant, gas is routed to a demethanizer tower, which separates it into a residue gas product stream and an NGL product stream.  The NGL stream is purified using an amine treater, which removes carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.  SRGP uses a flare to burn gases during emergency/upset conditions, system maintenance, and startup and shutdown.  The flare is also used to burn waste acid gas generated by the amine treatment system.  NGL is then pumped into the sales pipeline for further"
