We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n-A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation\r\n-An overview of our accident release prevention programs\r\n-The five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n-An overview of our emergency response program\r\n-An overview of the improvements made at the facility to minimize the potential for accidental chemical releases that could adversely affect our employees, public and the environment\r\n-Certifications in accordance with RMP rule\r\n-Relevant details information about the facility's risk management program \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\r\n\r\nThe Neal facility produces polypropylene using multiple chemicals and unit operations. The process utilizes the regulated flammable substance propylene along with catalyst and hydrogen as feedstock.  The process contains the RMP regulated substance propylene above the threshold quantity in storage vessels and reactors, columns, tanks and piping within the unit. \r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards to employees, the public, and the environment posed by these chemicals.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThe centerpiece of the accident release and prevention program"

This is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We take a systematic and proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n-Process safety information\r\n-Process hazard analysis\r\n-Operating procedures\r\n-Training\r\n-Mechanical integrity\r\n-Management of change\r\n-Pre-startup safety review\r\n-Compliance audits\r\n-Incident investigation\r\n-Employee participation\r\n-Hot work permit\r\n-Contractors\r\n\r\nWe actively encourage participation by all employees in process safety management. Relevant process safety is readily available to employees. Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies consistent with our Management of Change program. Procedures provide knowledge to ensure employees perform their jobs safely and correctly. Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged. Experienced employees are involved in training. Employees and contractors are trained and included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\r\n\r\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change policy, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews ensure that new installations or modifications are safe for startup and continued operation. Our Mechanical Integrity Program includes written procedures to assure that the affected process equipment is properly and safely maintained. The Neal plant's Hot Work Permit policy is consistently enforced to prevent hot work in potentially dangerous areas.\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to minimize the potential for accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business. We have established specific accountabilities and controls in support of our own high standards for accident prevention"
