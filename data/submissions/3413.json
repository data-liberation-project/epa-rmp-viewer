Peas are processed from mid-June to August, corn in August and September, and carrots and potatoes from early October to mid-November.  Shortly after processing, nearly all of the canned and frozen vegetables are shipped via truck to Seneca warehousing facilities located at 308 20th St. SE, Rochester, MN (approximately 8 blocks south of the processing facility).\n\n     An ammonia refigeration system is used at the processing facility - ammonia is a regulated substance per 40 CFR Part 68 Environmental Protection Agency (Appendix A).  The 12,400 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in the system is used to provide refrigeration for the IQF (Individually Quick Frozen) tunnels,air units in the freezer tunnel room, and a vegetable cooling unit utilizing chilled water.  The threshhold reporting quantitiy for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 lbs., thus Seneca's Process Facility  is required to comply with the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.\n\n     Seneca's Process Facility has an accidental release prevention program in place which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard.  The International Institute of Ammonia Refigeration's (IIAR) Guide to the Implementation of Process Safety Management (PSM) for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to implement the PSM program at the Process Facility.  Parts of the program include:\n\n                         1)    Employee Participation\n                         2)    Process Safety Information\n                         3)    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n                         4)    Operating Procedures\n                         5)    Training\n                         6)    Contractor Requirements\n                         7)    Pre Start-up Safety Review\n                         8)    Mechanical Integ"

The Passive Mitigation formula was used since the HTR is located inside of a building.  Factors for the formula included: \n\n                                                     Quantity of Ammonia = 12,400 lbs.\n                                                          Engine Room Size = 55,183 cu.ft.\n                                            Ventilation of Engine Room = 56,000 CFM\n\nThe result of the formula showed a potential toxic endpoint distance in an urban setting of .8 miles from the Seneca Process Facility Engine Room.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:\n\n     The Seneca Processing Facility has 12,400 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia on site.  The  Low Temperature Recirculator (LTR) located inside of the Tunnel Room is a vessel which is large enough to store the entire 12,400 lb. charge of ammonia.  It is possible that a large quantity of liquid ammonia could be stored in the vessel while performing maintenance on another part of the system.  It is also possible, but extremely improbable(-due to safeties, level controls, and a regulating valve) that all 12,400 lb. could migrate to the LTR during production.  The Off-site Consequence Analysis-Alternative Scenario for the Seneca Processing Facility is based on a rupture to the LTR while it contains 12,400 lbs. of ammonia.  \n\n     Rupturing  of a vessel can result from impact with a lift truck, thermal shock, or tank fatigue.  Although the LTR is protected from lift trucks by posts anchored into the concrete floor, this scenario was chosen because the vessel is located in a fork lift area.  The rupture of the LTR would have an off-site impact.\n\n     The Process Hazard Analysis(PHA) which was performed for the system in 1996 listed a"

The High Temperature Recirculator  (HTR) located inside of the Engine Room is a vessel which is large enough to store the entire 12,400 lb. charge of ammonia.  It is possible that a large quantity of liquid ammonia could be stored in the vessel while performing maintenance on another part of the system.  It is also possible, but extremely improbable (- due to a regulating valve, level controls, and safeties) that all 12,400 lb. could migrate to the HTR during production.  The Off-Site Consequence Analysis - Worst Case Scenario for the Seneca Processing Facility is based on a rupture to the HTR while it contains 12,400 lb. of ammonia.  Rupturing of a vessel can result from impact with a lift truck, thermal shock, or tank fatigue.  The rupture of the HTR would have an offsite impact.\n\n     The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was performed for the system in 1996 listed a rupture to\n the HTR as :\n\n                           a.) Likelihood = Very Low\n                                              and\n                           b.) Frequency of Occurrence = Has occured in industry\n\n     The PHA stated the following reasons that a rupture to the HTR would be unlikely:\n\n                         1) All vessels are designed according to appropriate ASME standards\n                         2) The vessel is elevated to minimize potential from fork lift traffic\n                         3) The lines are equipped with Pressure Relief Valves (PRV's), set to 250 psi to           \n                              relieve pressure and minimize over pressurization of the system\n                         4) The HTR is equipped with PRV's set to relieve at 150 psi\n                         5) The lines are equipped with a by-pass line to minimize the potential for over\n                              pressurization of the line and the HTR"
