The WWTP currently uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant in the treatment process and utilizes ton chlorine cylinders manifolded in pairs with a backup pair to provide the supply chlorine.  Additionally, the plant stores up to two reserve non-connected cylinders to replace chlorine cylinders in service as they are depleted.  No more than 12,000 pounds of chlorine is on the site at any time.\n\nThe City of Pulaski Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Program in an attempt to identify all possible chemical emergencies which may occur and the best way to prevent the accidental release of chlorine to the atmosphere from the plant?s chlorination facilities.  The City Personnel responsible for the daily maintenance and operation of the chlorination equipment conduct their work with the upmost professionalism and have a deep respect of the dangers involved with chlorine.  The City places chlorine safety ahead of all other matters.  \n\nThe City?s Process Safety Management (PSM) plan has been coordinated with the Giles County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City of Pulaski Safety Board to assure that all entities are aware of the possible dangers involved in a chlorine leak from the Water Treatment Plant.  The City has developed a written operations manual, Emergency Response Plan and emergency action plan as a part of the OSHA PSM plan. As a part of the written operations manual, City personnel proceed with work at a safe pace and double check all connections when changing tanks or adjusting the system.  Additional safety measures are installed in the form of ventilators and chlorine leak detectors which assist in the notification and protection of emergency personnel in the event of a leak.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan outlines the proper procedures to follow in"

Upon detection of the leak, the plant supervisor will notify the emergency service coordinator as defined in the City of Pulaski?s Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate assistance with outside emergency units.  The cause of the leak will then be determined so that appropriate actions may be taken to insure public safety.  The City of Pulaski Fire Department will act as standby rescue personnel for the plant operators while an attempt to stop the chlorine leak is made.  The fire department personnel will be familiarized with the chlorine system so as to assure that, if necessary, they may be able to isolate the leak and stop it.  The Emergency Service Coordinator will work with the Pulaski Police Department and other personnel to alert nearby residents to remove to safety if the need arises.  Local radio stations may also be utilized to notify the public of the emergency condition and what to do.To date, the City of Pulaski has had no major accidental releases of chlorine which required action involving off-site receptors.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the Risk Management Plan was evaluated as a rupture of a full ton chlorine cylinder and release of its contents to the atmosphere.  The most probable alternative release scenario has been determined to be a cracked and leaking supply line.  The EPA supplied RMPCOMP program was used to evaluate the area of effect for these releases. Using this program, it has been determined that both scenarios will have some offsite impact.  The worst case scenario has an area of effect of 0.9 miles in radius and the alternate scenario has an area of 0.1 miles in raduis.  The worst case scenario could possibly affect approximately 3,700 people and public receptors involved include schools, hospitals, major commercial areas, churches, and residences depending on the wind direction.
