The only hazardous chemical used at the plant in sufficient quantity to require compliance with the rules is chlorine.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant.\n\nGBRA has always recognized the need for care in the handling of chlorine.  Chlorine handling has been addressed in the GBRA Safety Manual, the job safety analysis, the emergency operations plan, the preventive maintenance program, and the biennial safety audit.  Training has been conducted annually with advanced training occurring biennially.  Training is conducted on practice containers purchased only to perform that function.  Leak detection systems are located at the Regional Plant that activates an alarm at the point of a leak.  Personnel called out to repair a leak have access to a hazardous chemical response trailer with all the safety gear and repair kits needed to stop a leak.\n\nEven with all of the care currently provided, the completion of the Risk Management Plan demonstrates the need for some improvements.  GBRA will schedule a Texas A & M Hazardous Waste Technicians course to complete training of all personnel that might be called upon to respond to a chemical leak.  GBRA will have mock drills that include the Victoria Fire Department, and other response personnel.  The Compliance Audit Checklist will be added to the biennial safety audit.  Additionally, items defined in the Hazard Review Checklist that require attention will be corrected.\n\nThe chlorine release worst case scenario is 1.9 miles.  The impact of this is to an 80% rural population located in the flood plain of the Guadalupe River and 20% urban population.  Redundant alarm systems exist at the Willow Street Plant, which notify the Regional Plant operator that a leak has occurred.  The Vict"

These do not assume that repairs would be made to the leaking container.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program was a functional plan, which is in the process of being upgraded."
