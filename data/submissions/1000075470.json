      "SummaryText": "CVC Specialty Chemicals (CVC) purchased the Maple Shade, New Jersey facility in June 1995 and began operations in June 1996.  CVC manufactures specialty epoxy monomers and resins based on epichlorohydrin chemistry.\r\n\r\nEpichlorohydrin is the only listed RMP and TCPA substance that is handled by CVC above the threshold quantity.  Epichlorohydrin is the basic building block used in epoxy manufacturing and provides the basis for the facility risk management and accident prevention programs.  Epichlorohydrin is handled at the facility in bulk in quantities that do not exceed 465,010 pounds.  Epichlorohydrin is stored in tote bins, one 15,000-gallon tank for fresh epichlorohydrin, three 2,000-gallon tanks for recycled epichlorohydrin, one 7,500-gallon tank for recycled epichlorohydrin, and two 1,500-gallon tanks for recovered epichlorohydrin.  Process equipment includes one 1,200-gallon reactor, one 2,000-gallon reactor, one 13,500-gallon reactor, two 4,100-gallon reactors, and one 3,000-gallon holding tank.\r\n\r\nThe epoxy resins and monomers (modifiers) produced by CVC are used primarily in the specialty coatings industry.  Applications include civil engineering coatings such as floor coatings, tank and secondary containment linings, and structural steel primers.  Other common uses include adhesives, and specialty automotive and aviation coatings and composites.\r\n\r\nThe CVC facility is designed and operated to minimize the potential for safety and environmental impacts to employees and the surrounding community.  CVC has demonstrated a commitment to safety and environmental compliance by involving employees and third-party engineering firms in the principals of process safety management.  In 2017, CVC partnered with Delaware Technical Community College (DTCC) to provide 16 hours of process safety training for every operator in the plant.\r\n\r\nIn the past 5 years, CVC has had two accidents in the covered process area, but only one accident is included in the TCPA/RMP 5-year ac"

      "SummaryText": "cident history as explained below.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 2016, an explosion occurred during steam distillation to remove trace amounts of xylene from the product. There were no injuries and no offsite impacts. The concentration of epichlorohydrin in the process was only 0.027% at the time of the event.  This accident is not included in the 5-year accident history because the concentration of epichlorohydrin was less than 1%.  The explosion was caused by the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the process and the formation of an unstable organic peroxide.  Hydrogen peroxide has been removed from the facility as a corrective action.\r\n\r\nOn January 7, 2017, a batch of epoxy resin started foaming in one of the reactors. The vent system filled with foam and approximately 200 gallons of batch material with a nominal composition of 50% epichlorohydrin entered the vent system.  The foam eventually reached the scrubber and overflowed into secondary containment.  Three employees were sent to the occupational health clinic as a precaution and recorded on the OSHA log as 3 lost work days.  There were no offsite impacts. The formation of foam was caused by a flow control valve passing through and high flow of nitrogen going to the reactor. The nitrogen flow control valve was replaced as a corrective action.\r\n\r\nThe CVC Maple Shade facility is operated as an RMP Program 3 facility.  Engineering and operational controls are described below.\r\n\r\nProcess safety information includes process flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, electrical input/output diagrams, fire water system piping diagrams, equipment specifications, and chemical safety data sheets.\r\n\r\nThe most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) and layers of protection analysis (LOPA) was conducted in March 2017 using the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) methodology.  CVC hired an outside engineering firm to facilitate the PHA/LOPA.\r\n\r\nWritten standard operating procedures are updated on a regular basis and include procedures f"
