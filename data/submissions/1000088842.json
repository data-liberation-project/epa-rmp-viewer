The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system which provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(1) Palletizing Room\n\n(1) Shipping Cooler\n\n(4) Ammonia Cold Storage Rooms \n\n(1) Precool Room\n\n(2) Receiving Coolers\n\n(2) Fumigation Rooms\n\n(3) Cherry Hydrocoolers\n\n(1) Receiving Hydrocooler\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\n\n\nMorada Produce is located at 500 N Jack Tone Rd. Stockton, CA 95215. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 37.977401, -121.147327. The facility is located approximately 5.5 miles east of state highway 99 and 1.5 miles south of state highway 26 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agricultural land.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area with a 0.2% annual chance  of flooding. \n\n\n\nMorada Produce is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Morada Produce has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nEach of the ammonia refrigerated zones are equipped with evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.

The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receivers are each equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators/hydrocoolers. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators/hydrocoolers. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators/hydrocoolers is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the suction accumulators. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid an"

The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nHydrocoolers\n\nThe purpose of the hydrocoolers is to remove heat from water which is used to precool fresh fruit. The hydrocoolers receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. Low pressure liquid and vapor exits the hydrocoolers and is returned to the supplying vessels. Under normal conditions, the hydrocoolers contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nSuction Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of the suction accumulators is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The suction accumulators receive vapor from the flooded accumulators and separate any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the suction accumulators drains by gravity into the dump traps. The suction accumulators are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the suction accumulators contain low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nDump Traps\n\nThe purpose of the dump traps is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrige"

Once the liquid level in the dump traps reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valves are energized for a period of time causing the dump traps to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions the dump traps can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the suction accumulators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators/hydrocoolers to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nAmmonia Detection System\n\nThe machinery room is equipped with two (2) ammonia detectors.

The control box contains three (3) valves.\n\nValve #1: High Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #2: Low Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #3: High to Low Pressure Control Valve\n\nOpening Valve #1 will evacuate the process through the high pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #2 will evacuate the process through the low pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #3 will equalize the high and low pressure portions of the system. \n\nThe emergency control box is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations.\n\n\n\nRelief Valves\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. Details regarding the relief valves are summarized below:\n\nEach relief valve has a set pressure equal to or less than the MAWP of the equipment that the relief valve protects;\n\nAll relief valves are connected to a common manifold which terminates into the ammonia diffusion tank; \n\nThe relief valve discharge termination pipe is equipped with a vent line sensor which will notify plant personnel if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nDiffusion Tank\n\nThe refrigeration system is equipped with an ammonia diffusion tank which mitigates most of the hazards associated with a relief valve lifting.
