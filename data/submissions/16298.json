IT IS 200,00 SQ.FT  DESIGNED FOR THE PROCESSING OF GREEN PEAS WHICH ARE HARVESTED,PROCESSED AND FROZEN IN JULY AND AUGUST OF EACH YEAR.THE FACILITIES ALSO INCLUDE COLD STORAGE AND PACKAGING AREAS.\n    THE AMMONIA REFRIGERATION SYSTEM WAS ALSO NEW IN 1997 AND IS CONSIDERED STATE OF THE ART WITH HIGH EFFICIENCY SCREW COMPRESSORS AND TOP QUALITY COMPONENTS THROUGHOUT. THE MAJORITY OF THE REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT IS SUPPORT FOR FRESH PACK OPERATIONS  6-8WKS  PER YEAR. AFTER WHICH THE AMMONIA IS PUMPED BACK TO HOLDING VESSELS UNTIL THE NEXT SEASON. 15% OF THE REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT IS ON LINE 12 MONTHS OF THE YEAR TO SUPPORT COLD STORAGE OPERATIONS. APPROXIMATELY  36000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS ON SITE FOR OUR OPERATIONS. PER THE MECHANICAL CODE  OUR REFRIGERATION SPACES ARE MONITORED BY AMMONIA DETECTION SYSTEMS, WITH AUDIO AND VISUAL ALARMS,CENTRAL STATION MONITORING AND AUTOMATIC EXHAUST SYSTEMS  INTERLOCKED TO SHUNT BREAKERS WHICH ISOLATE PROTECTED SPACES FROM ELECTRICALY INDUCED EXPLOSION . A 15000GAL. WATER TANK IS PIPED TO ALL RELIEF VALVES IN THE SYSTEM IN  CASE OF OVERPRESSURIZATION AND SUBSIQUENT RELIEF VALVE VENTING. \n    OUR OPERATION STAFF CONSISTS OF THREE OPERATING ENGINEERS, WHO ARE LICENSED AND MEMBERS OF THE OPERATING ENGINEERS UNION. THESE ENGINEERS ARE TRAINED IN THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF ALL REFRIGERATION AND BOILER EQUIPMENT. THIER EMERGENCY RESPONSE EQUIPMENT INCLUDES , RADIOS,SCBA'S,CANNISTER MASKS,CLASS A SUITS AND MONITORS. \n    OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING IS ONGOING YEAR ROUND. OFFSITE SAFETY TRAINING IS UTILIZED WHEN AVAILABLE.\n    THE PLANT HAS DOCUMENTED PROCEEDURES COVERING THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF AMMONIA ON SITE. THIS IS PART OF OUR \"PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\" AS DICTATED BY WAC 296-67-013.  TWIN CITY FOODS POLICY IS \"SAFETY FIRST\" .\n     FOR A DISCRIPTION OF THE WOST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO  SEE"
