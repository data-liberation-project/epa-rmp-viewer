We use a combination of accidental  release prevention programs and emergency action planning to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This executive summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have implemented, including:\n\n     * A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.\n     * A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\n     * An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n     * A five-year accident history for accidental release of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n     * An overview of the emergency response plan we rely on.\n     * An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and \n       adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Mid-Dakota Water Treatment Plant produces safe, reliable, high quality and economical potable water to all or part of 14 counties in east central South Dakota.  In our treatment process, we use the following chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics: Chlorine\n\nChlorine is used as a disinfectant to inactivate disease causing organisms and to maintain high quality potable water during distribution and storage.  The maximum inventory of chlorine that can be stored on-site in the treatment plant chlorine storage room is 22,000 pounds, le"

Since we are a fairly new facility and our distribution system is still under construction, we operate well below the ultimate design capacity and maintain a chlorine inventory at the Water Treatment Plant of only 12,000 pounds.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program and our contingency planning efforts help us manage the hazards posed to our employees, the public and the environment by our use of chlorine.\n\n3.0 Key Off-site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case senario and an alternate release scenario for our facility.  The following are brief summaries about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each senario:\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical: Chlorine\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Mid-Dakota Water Treatment Plant wuld be catastrophic failure of one full 2,000 pound container of chlorine.  The worst case is assumed to be a direct release over a 10-minute period, as required by the regulation.  The assumed metoerological conditions are 1.5 meters per second wind speed, atmospheric stability Class F (very stable, calm evening conditions) and rural terrain.  Because the chlorine containers are always stored in an enclosed storage room, the release rate to the atmosphere is reduced from 200 lb/min to only 110 lb/min.  The building enclosure providespassive mitigation of the chlorine release.  Under these conditions, the EPA OCA Reference Table 11 predicts a distance of 2.2 miles to the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) of the release.  The approximate population affected by this scenario is 160, based on the 1990 U.S. Census Data.\n\nThe public receptors within this distance include residences and recreation areas.  The environmental receptors within this distance include officially designated wildlife s"

This scenario assumes the release of gas chlorine from a one-ton container, through a 5/16-inch diamter valve body opening, due to a severed connection with the tank mounted vacuum regulator.  The release duration is assumed to be 60 minutes.  The container is assumed to release 900 pounds of chlorine, at a rate of 15 lb/min.  Because the chlorine containers are always stored in an enclosed storage room, the release rate to atmosphere is reduced from 15 lb/min to 8.25 lb/min.  The closest release rate to 8.25 lb/min on the EPA Reference Table is 10 lb/min, so the 10 lb/min release rate is used.  The building enclosure provides passive mitigation of the chlorine release.  The assumed meteorological conditions are 3.0 meters per second wind speed, atmospheric stability Class D (neutral stability, overcast conditions) and rural terrain.
