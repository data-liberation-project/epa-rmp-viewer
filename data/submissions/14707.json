This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as\ntraining personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of\nour processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to\ncontrol and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant, located in Hamlin, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum\nproducts (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from natural gas. The Hamlin gas plant has\nseveral regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. There are no regulated toxic substances\nat the Hamlin facility.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS,\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level\n3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nlargest storage tank containing 60,000 gallons (241,000 lb) of natural gas liquids (Y-Grade). A\nwritten procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 90% of the maximum tank capacity;\ntherefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum\ndistance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.49 miles. Although numerous controls are in place\nto prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures\nwas taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Hamlin gas plant is a VCE\nresulting from the release of 6000 gallons from a product loading pump. The release is expected to\nbe isolated by the operators within 15 minutes"

This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in\nemergency planning and response. Figure 1-1 graphically presents the hazard assessment results for\nthe flammable WCS and ARS events.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Hamlin plant. Because\nprocesses at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk\nmanagement program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each\nof the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident\nprevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management\nand accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling\ntechnical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard\nanalysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to ail information created as part of the gas plant\naccident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention\nprogram are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and\naddresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of\ninitiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives\ninclude forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have\nmembers from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant\nmanagement.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes.

Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility\nfor maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents\nand their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help\nemployees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The gas plant ensures\nthat the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring\ninstruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown\nsystems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design\nand construction of process equipment, This information includes materials of construction, design\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination\nwith written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that\nsafety features in the process are not compromised.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the\nvarious processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically\nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to\nperform these evaluations.

This team identifies and evaluates\nhazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes\nsuggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such \nmeasures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking\nassigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the\nhighest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team\nfindings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and\nretained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly\nfrom the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard\nanalysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted\nat this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates\nare documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for\nconsideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations,\nsuch as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown,\n(5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a\nreference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\nThese procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.

New employees\nreceive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.\nAfter successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn\nprocess-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills\ndemonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own,\nthey can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the\noperating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\nThis refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for\neach operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased\nmaintenance or construction activities.

Gas plant personnel periodically\nmonitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPro-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a\nchange in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features,\nprocedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the\nequipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in\naccordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The\nPSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification\nthat accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Hamlin gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels,\npiping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown\nsystems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting\ntraining, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting\nidentified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.
