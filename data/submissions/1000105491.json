Energy Transfer\u0092s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency planning and response activities in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and continuous improvement efforts to improve safety at the facility.\nNon-Responding Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nEnergy Transfer owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Midkiff, Texas.  The Benedum Gas Plant compresses and treats natural gas to produce residue gas (methane) and natural gas liquids (NGL).  After processing, the residue gas and NGL exit the plant via product pipelines. \nGas enters the plant through either a high- or low-pressure inlet system.  Low-pressure gas is compressed and sent through amine treatment to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide; the resulting waste gas is burned off using a flare.  Amine-treated gas is then mixed with the high-pressure inlet gas and flows through a molecular sieve gas dehydrator to remove water.  The gas then flows to a cryogenic unit that separates out NGL, which leaves the Benedum Gas Plant via pipeline.  The remaining gas is compressed and leaves the plant via pipeline. \nField (unstabilized) condensate is delivered to the Benedum Gas Pl"

Field condensate is fed into a gun-barrel tank for initial three-phase separation.  Gas produced from this separation is sent to a vapor recovery unit and then to the plant\u0092s low-pressure inlet system.  Pre-stabilized condensate flows to a heater treater before being stored in a roof storage tank.  Water produced at the Benedum Gas Plant is routed and stored in a fixed roof storage tank.  The fixed-roof storage tanks are periodically emptied via tank truck load-out.  \nThe RMP flammable substances and mixtures stored or processed at the facility are the flammable mixture comprised of methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, and pentane, which is being processed through the plant; as well as propane, which is used as refrigerant in the cryogenic process. There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  \nEnergy Transfer has determined that the gas plant should be considered one process under the RMP rule.  This facility has one process (as defined by the regulation) consisting of a flammable mixture and propane.  Although the systems containing the flammable mixture and the propane are not interconnected, an incident in one of the systems could trigger a release in the other system, therefore, the two systems should be considered one process (see definition of \u0093process\u0094 at 40 CFR 68.3). \nEnergy Transfer has determined that Benedum Gas Plant is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the RMP regulation because the nearest public receptor is within the worst-case scenario flammable endpoint radius and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard. \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency planning and response programs in place at the facility include:\n-\tOperating i"

A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include: \n-\tProviding overpressure relief valves on pressurized vessels.\n-\tProviding level transmitters and alarms on vessels to help prevent overfilling.\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare.\n-\tProviding automated and manual valves to isolate portions of the process.\n-\tInstalling hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the gas plant to alarm personnel of a possible explosive environment.\n-\tInstalling fire eye detectors throughout the gas plant to alarm personnel of a possible fire.\n-\tInstalling security lighting to facilitate observation of the entire facility.\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of emergencies by manning the facility 24/7/365.\n-\tProviding an evacuation alarm system in order to safely evacuate personnel from the facility.\n-\tConducting periodic operational rounds to ensure problems are detected and corrected in a timely manner.\n\tFive-Year Accident History\n\tNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or significant property damage or known offsite impacts (e.g. death, injury, property damage, shelter in place, evacuation, or environmental damage) from the accidental release of a regulated substance has occurred at the facility within the last five years.\n\tEmergency Planning and Response Program\n\tThe facility wil"
