      "SummaryText": "1. The facility policy. The owners, management, and employees of Utica Elevator Co. Are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of\nproper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work\nwith the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire\ndepartment and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for a response to any\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility information. The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia\nfor sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application\nas a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 224314 pounds in the\nfacility's 2 tanks. The capacities of each of these tanks are 30,000 gallons and 18,000 gallons. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140196, which\nrepresents the volume of the strorage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by the design standards\nand company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is\n2.76 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch\ntransfer hose, with 26636 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of\ndispersion is 1.56 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release program: the facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating\nto The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment,\nContainers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of\nAgriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and\nhandling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History. There have been no accidental releases "

The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in\naccordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the\nright-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA. Our emergency response\naction plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local\nemergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.\nPeriodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.\nThere are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for\nimplementation at this time."
