At the completion of the reaction, all of the AN is consumed.\n\n\n\nThe process uses standard operating procedures for unloading and process operation.\n\n\n\nThe unloading system utilizes a vapor recovery system and a zero emission (dry break) connection.\n\n\n\nA PHA was conducted on the unloading, transfer and reaction process utilizing HAZOP checklists.\n\n\n\nThe area where AN is handled is within secondary containment, which will hold the entire volume of AN.\n\n\n\nThe site utilizes a Management of Change process. This process includes MSDS/SDS, PHA, Process Safety Information, Reactivity review, regulatory review, safety review, RAGAGEP for engineering standards, a PSSR process, HAZCOM & Process training and exposure monitoring. \n\n\n\nEmployees have received training in basic emergency response. The plant has an emergency alarm system. The facility utilizes a web-based area emergency notification system. The system will notify the SERLEPC, surrounding cities and affected plants in the area should the need arise.\n\n\n\nThe site maintains a fire water system designed to NFPA standards. The system consists of hydrants and monitors that cover the process and storage tank areas. Additionally the capability to apply foam from each monitor station is in place.

Acrylonitrile, the regulated substance, is brought into the plant in dedicated trailers. The acrylonitrile is unloaded through a dedicated closed system into a dedicated storage tank. The acrylonitrile is pumped and metered from the dedicated storage tank to the reactor through acrylonitrile dedicated piping. The acrylonitrile is mixed with other reactants (amination reaction) and is totally consumed at the end of the reaction process. At this point, the next steps in the process do not contain acrylonitrile.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMCBP maintains a Safety, Health, Environmental and security management system (Responsible Care; Management System or RCMS) which is certified by an independent third party auditor. MCBP considers the safety and health of the public, its employees, contractors and customers and the protection of the environment to be among our key priorities. We continually strive to maintain our facilities in compliance with all applicable local, state and federal laws governing environmental. Health, safety and security. We continually strive to manage operations in a manner that protects the environment, employees, surrounding communities and equipment. The RCMS consists of identifying hazards/risk, mitigating those risks, implementation and auditing. This management system includes the assessment of release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n\nMCBP is a PSM covered facility. As such, MCBP has fully implemented the elements of the PSM process. A Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) revalidation was conducted with regards to acrylonitrile. The acrylonitrile unloading system and the the production process were reviewed. The PHA systemati"

The process identified hazards, credible human errors and/or equipment failures that could lead to an accidental release, evaluated the likelihood and/or consequences of various scenarios, determined if existing specific prevention controls are adequate and where inadequate, identify corrective actions. PHAs at MCBP are conducted by a multi-disciplinary team that includes representatives from operations, maintenance, technical and HSE.\n\n\n\nMCBP maintains clearly written operating procedures and safe work practices to ensure that both experienced and inexperienced employees will respond in a safe, consistent and prescribed manner. Procedures are reviewed on an annual basis or as needed.\n\n\n\nMCBP utilizes a Management of Change (MOC) process to ensure changes to the process (chemicals, technology, equipment & personnel) are scrutinized before they are made to ensure the changes do not compromise the safety and integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMCBP has a well-established mechanical integrity program. This program ensures that equipment critical to process safety is fabricated to specification, installed correctly and maintained in a safe operating condition.\n\n\n\nMCBP's management stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs and in written materials available, including safe operating procedures. \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \n\nMCBP has implemented appropriate administrative and technological safeguards to ensure the safety of workers and continued safety of public receptors. Prior to bringing acrylonitrile onsite MCBP designed a dedicated acrylonitrile unloading, storage and process system. The system includes the use of zero emission truck fittings, vapor recovery unloading, dedicated piping systems with minimal flange connections, zero emissions pump (mag drive) and flange covers. "
