Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.The storage and handling system consists of storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst case and alternative case scenario. however, since this is security sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations. \n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n          -    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n          -    to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, propert"
