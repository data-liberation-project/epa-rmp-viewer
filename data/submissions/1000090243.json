      "SummaryText": "The Olney Water Treatment Plant produces approximately 1,500,000 gallons of water per day for use by residents of Olney, Parkersburg, Dundas, West Liberty, Noble, and Watergate.  The Olney Water Treatment Plant staff is committed to safety.  This includes the safe use of chemicals required to treat Olney's water.  One of these chemicals, chlorine, is a regulated substance.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water prior to its introduction into the distribution system.  At any given time, 5000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the water plant.  Chlorine is a toxic chemical that would cause off site impacts if an uncontrolled release would occur.  The worst case senario includes the rupture of the chlorine container, releasing 2000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes.  Using a computer model supplied by the USEPA, the chlorine cloud formed by this realease would be toxic to a point of 2.2 miles from the Water Treatment Plant.  It is estimated that the population withinthis radius is approximately 8100.  Safety measures including chlorine detectors, operator training, and regular maintenance make the worst case scenario unlikely.  An alternative scenario includes a break in the chlorine line.  The computer model indicates this release would be toxic to a point 0.5 miles from the Water Treatment Plant.  It is estimated that the population within this radius is approximately 520.  Safety measures including chlorine detectors, operator training, regular maintenance, and daily inspections make this scenario unlikely.\n\n\n\nThere has not been a release of chlorine to the atmosphere at the Onley Water Treatment Plant in the past five years.  The emergency response to a release of chlorine is to notify the Olney Fire and Police Departments and implement the Emergency Response Plan."
