The system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day. Walking inspections are conducted on intervals no longer than 8 hours. System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenace activities.\r\n\r\nThe system is equpped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors and overrides. In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected. The system is equipped with a shutdown system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room. The system shutdown can be manually operated using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\r\n\r\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia. The facility conducts periodic incident evacuation drills. The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or off-site evacuation or sheltering in place. Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia in the event they should occur.\r\n\r\nLALA Branded Products Inc. has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.
