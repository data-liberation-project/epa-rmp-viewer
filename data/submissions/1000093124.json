      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCRC is strongly committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, CRC maintains an operational policy that requires compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. Significant resources have been used to implement a robust Process Safety Management (PSM) program that is compliant with 29 CFR 1910.119 and, more importantly, is continually being improved to further reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release. CRC's PSM program addresses all 14 elements of PSM including those elements listed in 40 CFR 68 Subpart D. Several years ago, CRC established an HSE committee with a PSM subcommittee. The PSM subcommittee is comprised of hourly and salary personnel from departments throughout the company. This group meets once a month and works to identify and implement further improvements to our PSM program.\n\n\n\nCRC's Emergency Response Plan meets or exceeds the requirements as set forth in 40 CFR 68.95 (Risk Management Rule, Subpart E - Emergency Response), 29 CFR 1910.119(n) (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals) and 29 CFR 1910.38(a) (OSHA's Emergency Action Plans Regulation). The primary objective of the Emergency Response Plan is to address what action CRC employees should take in the event of an accidental release of hazardous chemicals. The Emergency Response Plan contains emergency notification procedures and telephone numbers for the local fire district and other agency contacts (e.g., Calcasieu LEPC). As part of its Risk Management Program, CRC has implemented an automatic calling service that notifies Calcasieu Refining personnel if an emergency upset has the potential to cause an off-site impact.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nCalcasieu Refining Company (CRC) operates The Lake Charles Crude Oil Refinery, which is located about five miles southwest of Lake Charles, Louisiana"

      "SummaryText": " in Calcasieu Parish.  The Lake Charles Crude Oil Refinery currently consists of two Atmospheric Distillation Units (ADUs - CDU No. 2 and CDU No. 5), two Vacuum Tower Units (VTUs), associated process equipment, a storage terminal, product loading operations, and support utility systems (e.g., boilers and wastewater treatment). The ADUs and VTUs separate crude oil into various petroleum fractions, including, but not limited to, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and vacuum tower bottoms {VTB). These refined petroleum products are sold and transported offsite by barge, product pipeline, and tanker truck. The facility operates 24 hours a day and may process up to approximately 90,000 barrels per day of crude oil. \n\nThe CRC facility meets the definition of stationary source as contained in 40 CFR 68.3. Parts of the operations at this facility involve the distillation and storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and are subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions located in Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (i.e., 40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\nBased on a thorough review of the CRC facility there is only one affected process with a regulated substance (RS) present above its threshold quantity. This process is the distillation and storage of LPG in storage tanks TK-2001A/B. LPG is a mixture of various hydrocarbon compounds including propane, butane, and pentane. The entire LPG mixture is considered to be a RS because it has a NFPA flammability hazard rating of four (4). The LPG contains the following listed RSs: methane (0.2 weight percent), ethane (1.6 weight percent), propane (11.98 weight percent), isobutane (9.5 weight percent), normal butane (22.0 weight percent), isopentane (20.5 weight percent), normal pentane (19.3 weight percent), and heavy hydrocarbons (15.1 weight percent).\n\n\n\nThe CRC facility does not have any processes that contain toxic RSs in amounts or conditions that warrant review under the Chemical Accident Prevent"

Therefore, under the mixture rule, the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the mixture is not subject to the review. Other flammable mixtures present in the facility have an NFPA flammability rating of three or less and are; therefore, exempt under the mixture rule. For example, naphtha has an NFPA rating of three (3), kerosene has an NFPA rating of two (2), diesel has an NFPA rating of two (2), and reduced crude has an NFPA rating of one (1).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of CRC's PSM program.  Actions taken under this program have already improved the safety of the LPG storage process. CRC's LPG system includes emergency shutdown systems, LEL monitors, a deluge system, and PSVs. Truck loading operation has remained available as back up to high-pressure transfer pumps and the pipeline. The truck station and connecting lines were relocated to be greater than 50 feet from the LPG Storage Tanks. Whenever the LPG pipeline is down the LPG is transported to our customer in tank trucks.\n\n\n\nThe LPG system complies with the API 2510 Standard, including but not limited to these accident prevention measures:\n\n *  Spill containment is designed to insure product drains away from the storage tanks in the event of a release.\n\n *  Ball-type shutoff valves are placed on the tank nozzle to enhance tank safety\n\n *  Fire valves that close automatically in a fire case and actuators for remote operation are installed.\n\n *  Backflow check valves are installed on dedicated vessel fill piping.\n\n *  The pumps, thermal relief device and block valves in the path of relief are car sealed open.\n\n *  Structural and piping supports are fireproofed.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFor the"
