Mallinckrodt Baker will develop, manufacture, use, distribute, and dispose of chemical products safely and in a manner that insures protection of health and the environment.  The company is committed to providing the necessary information and support to employees, customers, distributors, contractors, and the general public so that the same, high standard of care is applied in the handling of our products throughout their life cycle.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMallinckrodt Baker - Phillipsburg manufactures inorganic and organic salts and purifies acids and solvents.  The facility is located on a 25-acre parcel in Phillipsburg, NJ and Lopatcong Township, NJ, and is comprised of about 60 buildings containing manufacturing operations, utility services, and warehousing.\n\nThe three EPA-regulated products are ammonia, pentane, and ethyl ether.

In the worst case scenarios, a catastrophic failure of the largest process vessel over a ten minute duration was considered and modeled at a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec in \"F\" class atmospheric conditions.\n\nToxics\nWorst Case - Anhydrous Ammonia\nA tank truck of ammonia ruptures catastrophically while unloading.  The truck discharges the entire 36,000-lb load in 10 minutes.  No emergency response is enacted, no safety devices function, and all of the material evaporates.  The EPA modeling techniques indicate a plume extending up to 2.3 miles.  There are approximately 23,000 residents in the included area.  Only a fraction of these residents would be affected in this unlikely event due to plume effects.\n\nAlternate scenario - Ammonia\nA transfer hose develops 1/4\" hole during truck unloading.  The release continues for 15 minutes until the operator activates the automatic shutdown system.  1,770 lbs are released.  The release plume is substantively reduced through the efforts of the response team, in combination with the installed water spray and foam vapor suppression systems.  The potentially effected radius under \"D\" class conditions and average temperatures is 0.10 mile.  There are approximately 0 residents in the included area.\n\n\nFlammables\nWorst case - Pentane\nA tannk-wagon of pentane ruptures catastrophically  while unloading.  The wagon discharges the entire 45,000-lb. load in 10 minutes.  No emergency response in enacted, no safety devices function, and all of the material evaporates.  A vapor plume disperses off-site and is subsequently ignited causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The EPA modeling techniques indicate an instantaneous overpressure condition of 1 psi felt at a distance of 0.28 miles.  There are approximately 367 residents in the included area.\n\nAlternate scenario - Pentane\n"

A pool fire results requiring the emergency response team to be activated.  The effect of this fire will be felt at a distance of 0.023 miles.  There are approximately 0 residents in the affected area.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMallinckrodt Baker handles millions of pounds of regulated products each year.  There have been no incidents which have involved deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on or off-site, and there are no instances of adverse impact to the employees, community, or the environment in the past five years.\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nMallinckrodt Baker Phillipsburg has an emergency response program that includes administrative and operational response procedures, training, and drills.  This program includes interface with the LEPCs and other emergency response groups, and has been audited by state and federal agencies many times.  MBI works closely with the local response organizations, has included representatives as drill observers, and supports responder training through the loan of equipment and facilities for training purposes.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMallinckrodt Baker uses a variety of means to prevent accidental releases.  These include written procedures and training, preventive maintenance, change management and permitting procedures, incident investigations, inspections, audits and drills.  Additionally, there are many engineering controls in place that include remote sensing alarms, automatic shutdown systems, pressure relief systems, spill containment, and water and foam vapor suppression systems that provide multiple layers of protection.  An active Process Safety engineering efforts, various internal leadership teams and audits by corporate, local, state, and federal agencies further insure an environment of continuous improvement and incremental risk reduction."
