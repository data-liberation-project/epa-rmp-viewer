We are committed to supplying consumers with quality products and maintaining a safe work environment for our team members, visitors, and community. Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration systems. The refrigeration system is used to maintain the required temperatures in our coolers, freezers, and production rooms. The refrigeration system is a closed loop system with the ammonia contained within piping and vessels throughout our facility. Farmer's Pride, Inc. refrigeration system contains approximately 28,298 pounds of ammonia.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention:  Farmer's Pride, Inc. has implemented many precautionary measures to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from its refrigeration system. Precautions include: a state of the art refrigeration monitoring system which alerts refrigeration personnel of any equipment problems or potentially unsafe conditions long before the potential for an ammonia release is reached, an ammonia detection system which alerts refrigeration department personnel at the first sign of a release, Emergency shutdown system which will allow any employee to quickly shutdown the refrigeration system to minimize a release. The refrigeration department conducts an inspection of the entire ammonia system daily. In addition, all maintenance personnel performing preventive maintenance on the system are qualified and thoroughly trained. Maintenance personnel are required to follow the written standard operating procedures (SOP) developed for each maintenance task performed on the system.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: Farmer's Pride, Inc. has developed and maintains a Risk Management Program in accordance with EPAA\u00bfs rule 40 CFR 68 and a Process Safety Management program designed to comply with OSHA standards 29 CFR"
