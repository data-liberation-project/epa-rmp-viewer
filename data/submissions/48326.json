All applicable procedures of the Iowa Fertilizer Law are adhered to. The emergency response policy involves the preparationof response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n2. The FC facility at Yale is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. The location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.\n\n3. FC's accidental release prevention plan is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Annual training of all personel required to handle ammonia and what to do in an emergency.\n\n* Facilities constructed & maintained according to the Iowa Fertilizer Law.\n\n* Use of usual anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.\n\n* Use of effective operating procedures according to Agricom's anhydrous ammonia safety procedures handbook and training procedures.\n\n* Annual inspections by IDALS of storage tanks, piping for leaks, nurse tanks, applicators, transfer risers, riser hoses, safety equipment, pressure relief valve records, etc.\n\n* FC site inspections by safety committee members at least twice a year.\n\n4. No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5. This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Yale Fire Department and the Guthrie County LEPC. This program includes response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency operations and response procedures are reviewed annually, with a site visit of the facility by the Fire Department.\n\n6. Changes to improve safety at this facility are completed as required by rule change and/or methods to increase safety and/"
