If an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production      nutrients. The maximum quanity stored would be 196,300 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n     a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximun quanity released would be 140,200 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\n    b.   The alternate release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .40 miles.\n4.   The accidental release prevention program.\n    This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. K61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.222, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n5.   The Five-yeasr History.\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n    to our"

The emergency response program.\n    This facility has:\n     a.   A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n     b.   Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n     c.   A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7.   Planned changes to improve safety.\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Perodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
