The same properties that makes chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as wastewater treatment chemicals, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide, Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Safety & Environmental Associates Inc. (SEA, Inc.).  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of Conway Corporation Dispatch and/or Conway Corporation Systems Superintendent, then notifying the Conway Fire Department via 911, the notification of the Faulkner County Office of Emergency Services will also be by the 911 call for assistance in evacuation of surrounding population. The Conway Fire Department and Faulkner County Office of Emergency Services will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems. This emergency response plan also includes procedures for the mitigation of a liquid chlorine release if it would ever happen. The most probable event would be a vapor chlorine release, which there are no mitigation measures for, only evacuation.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the wastewater by utilizing chemicals such as chlorine and sulfur dioxide.

All chlorine cylinders operate on a vacuum system with the vacuum regulator mounted on the wall. The sulfur dioxide cylinders have cylinder mounted vacuum regulator system that will help prevent the continual operation of the system if there is an increase or decrease in operating pressure on the cylinders or lines. The chlorine cylinders do not have cylinder mounted vacuum regulators; they are mounted on the wall. Therefore, the possible continual release of chlorine from the flexible feed lines is more probable if the line were to rupture. The vacuum system does help prevent other releases of chlorine throughout the chlorination system up until the chlorine reaches the water. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at the 1001 Sherwood Lane location are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The chlorine is the only substance that falls under Risk Management Plan requirements; however, Turtle Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant will include sulfur dioxide also as part of their prevention and process safety management plan. The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this plant is 8,000 pounds. There will only be one cylinder (2,000 pounds) on line at any one time with another on automatic switchover. The other two will be stored until needed. The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide at this location is 4,000 pounds.\n\nThis wastewater treatment facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years. The automatic vacuum system helps to prevent/limit the amount (if any) of chlorine that escapes during operational periods.\n\nOur emergency response program wa"
