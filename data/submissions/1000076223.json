Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board (GWWSB) C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant is committed to the safety of our workers, the public, and the environment.  The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1-ton containers and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n \n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately c"

B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant chlorination processes.  The following details the prevention program elements at The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure The GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe GWWSB C. B. Collier, Jr. Water Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process "
