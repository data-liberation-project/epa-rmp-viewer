Glenn Research Center (GRC) at Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility (GRC-ATF).  The NASA GRC-ATF conducts environmental testing of hardware and systems that are intended for space applications for NASA, the Department of Defense (DOD), and commercial aerospace industry.  This testing involves the storage and use of aerospace fluids, including hydrogen.  To meet future aerospace test requirements, NASA GRC-ATF anticipates storage and use of hydrogen in amounts above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lb.  At this time the worst-case analysis release modeling shows there are no public or environmental receptors impacted.  There have been no accidents pertaining to hydrogen at NASA GRC-ATF in the past five years. \n\nA.\t Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe NASA GRC-ATF is committed to providing a safe place of employment by meeting or exceeding applicable health and safety requirements to assure personnel, community, environmental safety, and preservation of resources.  NASA GRC-ATF has a history of conducting hazardous testing with liquid rocket propellants.  Designing, building, operating, and maintaining safe, reliable systems is the key to preventing accidental releases. \n\nThe NASA GRC management system processes and procedures include key safety controls to properly contain and maintain the hazardous substances used and stored at GRC-ATF The primary controls are engineering controls focused on the safe design, build up, and operation of systems. \n\nThe NASA GRC achievement of ISO9001/AS9100 certification assures implementation of the Quality Management System (QMS) at the facility.
