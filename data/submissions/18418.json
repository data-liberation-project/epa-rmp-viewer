System changes have been changes in kind and have not required Management of Change or Startup Review.\n\nThe quantity of ammonia refrigerant used in this facility requires OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Level 3 Risk Management to assure the mechanical integrity of this refrigeration system and the health and safety of on-site employees and off-site public and environmental receptors. \n\nNo on-site or off-site ammonia related incident, resulting in injury, death, property, or environmental damage occurred during the 1994-1998 period covered by a Five Year Accident History prepared for Risk Management. \n\nA ten minute unmitigated worst case release of 15,000 pounds of ammonia and a ten minute unmitigated alternative release of 500 pounds of ammonia were scenarios selected from EPA models and data to illustrate ammonia plume dispersion.\n\nEPA Risk Management requirements have been integrated into an existing community emergency response plan based on 1994 State of Alaska sponsored hazard analysis recommendations for Sand Point, and into a facility action response plan."
