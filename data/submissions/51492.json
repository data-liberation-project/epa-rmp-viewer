Aqueous Ammonia (23%) is one chemical that will be utilized onsite which falls under the RMP applicability in a threshold quantity. Due to the 23% percentage as well as the NA code of 325193 Ethyl Alcohol Manufacturing code, the 23% aqueous ammonia falls into program level 2. In order to eliminate and control hazards, quality system procedures have been developed to provide instruction on the receiving, offloading, and use of 23% aqueous ammonia. As well as start up, shut down, and emergency procedures for the operation of the plant. The maintenance records of the tank, valves, and indicators for the ammonia system will be stored in the electronic maintenance system, MapCon. The quality system will utilize a committee, audits, and tracking to ensure procedures are adequate and implemented in a scheduled manner. The RMP program will be updated and completed by the Technical Manager and tracked using the compliance calendar. Training is defined, implemented, and tracked to ensure employees are aware and capable to deal with hazards in the workplace. Any future incidents, process changes, and items to address from compliance audits will be logged in the issues database for all to learn from. PTE is committed to the safety of the employees and the general public which would be affected in the event of an incident involving 23% aqueous ammonia. In order to avoid pentane and isopentane releases, loading of Fuel Ethanol procedures have been developed as well as an offloading of denaturant procedure . Operational rounds are frequent and would detect any issue with the ethanol storage tanks.                                                                                                                                               \n"
