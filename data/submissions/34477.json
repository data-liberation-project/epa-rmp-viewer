The steam is used for enhanced oil recovery and a portion of the electrical power is consumed by ChevronTexaco, while all surplus power is sold to the local utility. An aqueous ammonia process was added to the existing Cogeneration Plant and was started up in 2nd quarter 2000.  The ammonia reduces the amount of nitrogen oxides (Nox) in the flue gas, which is accomplished by injecting ammonia vapor in the flue gas just prior to exposure to a catalyst.  The resultant chemical reaction reduces the Nox to harmless nitrogen and water.   The aqueous ammonia that is used is a 20% or greater concentration.  The maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia at the facility is above EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities, and above the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) threshold quantity.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/RESPONSE POLICY\n                         \nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.

Our management demonstrates its commitment to safety and the environment by enforcing CHEVRONTEXACO'S Corporate Policy 530.  Policy 530 states that the Company will conduct scientific hazards assessments, as needed, to identify, characterize, and safely manage any potential hazards of company operations. In addition policy 530 outlines a number of management practices covering all facets of company operations and attainment definitions describing compliance.\n \nEmployee Participation:\n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n\n \nProcess Safety Information: \n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n \nCompliance Audits:\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Eastridge Cogeneration Facility periodically conducts a number of audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Audits include level III operations inspections, level II compliance audits and level 1 corporate audits. Audits are conducted at least every year.   Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n \nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n \nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n \nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) emergency shutdown (4) normal shutdown, (5) initial startup of a new process.

This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n \n \nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Eastridge Cogeneration Facility has implemented a refresher training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., oral tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically read and revalidate the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted every year.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n  \nMaintenance:\n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Eastridge Cogeneration Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n \nSafe Work Practices:\n\nThe Eastridge Cogeneration Facility has a long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.
