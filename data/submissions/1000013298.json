Senior management is committed to protecting the health of its employees and the general public and is actively developing comprehensive safety management plans to achieve these objectives.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDODGE manages the facility in compliance with Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), and United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) regulations. Senior management at the facility are designated as having primary responsibility for ensuring compliance to these programs.    \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDODGE provides embalming chemicals for mortuary services.  Raw materials are compounded or mixed at the facility, bottled, stored, and shipped to customers.  The first floor of the facility includes the product mixing and bottling areas, warehouse, chemical storage areas, truck bays, and a shipping room.  Administrative areas, offices, and laboratory space is contained on the second floor. DODGE operates two processes that use and/or store formaldehyde containing solutions: product mixing/bottling (Process 1) and warehouse storage (Process 2).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDODGE has put in place several measures that serve to prevent/mitigate the release of liquid formaldehyde in the mixing, bottling, warehouse, and shipping areas.  These include:\n\n- Fire extinguishers are located throughout the processing and warehouse areas and personnel that work in these areas have been trained on their proper use.\n- Personal protection equipment and spill kits are located throughout the processing and warehouse areas and personnel that work in these areas have been trained on their proper use"

      "SummaryText": ".\n- Mixing of formaldehyde only occurs in the compounding room when two or more personnel are present and observing operations.\n- Shut-off valves at the storage tank and throughout the production line can immediately prevent chemical flow at several points in the process stream.\n- Warehouse workers are trained in the proper handling of materials, including forklift operation.\n- An emergency response plan has been established with the Cambridge Fire Department.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of formaldehyde at the Dodge Company since it began operations in 1893.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDODGE has a written emergency response plan which has been filed with the Cambridge Fire Department, who is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDODGE conducted a process hazards analysis (PHA) for the formaldehyde process operations in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation (29 CFR 1910.119). The PHA was based on a what-if question checklist developed through brainstorming and supplemented with unique site-specific issues to ensure that hazards of this process were thoroughly reviewed.  Hazards and applicable recommendations were developed and documented during the PHA.  The recommendations for engineering and administrative (E/A) controls for these scenarios and others identified are documented within the PHA What-If Checklist."
