Box 578   Imperial,  NE  69033\r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY    \r\n\r\nFacility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nFacility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"Establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators\", however we are also engaged in providing \"Agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we felt most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading is #115112 \"Soil Preparation Planting and Cultivating\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural uses and home heating.  We include Propane (as well as all crop protectants and petroleum products) in our planning training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early summer and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.\r\n\r\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the"

Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation. \r\n\r\nWorst-case release scenario:\r\n\r\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of a rail car while at our location.  The maximum quantity released is based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) distance is based on EPA's RMP-Comp Program (Version 1.07) as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the LEPC to assist them in their planning.\r\n\r\nAlternate release scenario:\r\n\r\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydropus Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual, self closing excess flow, and \"pull away\" valves, so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is calculated per instructions following EPA guidance.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Program:\r\n\r\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standardK-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, Breakaway couplers at risers, Emergenc"
