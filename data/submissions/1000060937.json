The facility started up in 2008 and was purchased from Southwest Georgia Ethanol, LLC by FHR Camilla in 2015.  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. FHR Camilla is subject to the RMP rule due to the onsite storage of natural gasoline (denaturant), a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantity. \n\nFHR Camilla is committed to protecting the environment and operating FHR Camilla in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to applicable federal and state rules and regulations, and as such, the design and construction of FHR Camilla has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of personnel, FHR Camilla has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.\n\nIn the event of a release, the FHR Camilla's emergency response is described in its Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan. The ERAP consist of procedures for responding to releases, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address emergency response (including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures), evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emerge"

In addition, FHR Camilla has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions on the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training on performing their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to FHR Camilla processes or emergency response procedures.\n\n2.    Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFHR Camilla is a corn-based denatured ethanol fuel production plant which operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a batch fermentation and continuous distillation process.\n\nThe RMP regulated material stored at FHR Camilla is natural gasoline which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nFHR Camilla has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. FHR Camilla complies with RMP for the management of regulated substances onsite, i.e., denaturant.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFHR Camilla encourages employees to participate in safety management and accident prevention. FHR Camilla has developed an employee participation program as part of the RMP program. Process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the ope"

The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: fire, explosion, over-pressurization, overfilling, equipment failure, Loss of cooling, heating, electricity, instrument air, tornados, and hurricanes. FHR Camilla utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases. FHR Camilla also utilizes dike containment around the site's storage tanks, including the denaturant storage tank, to contain and mitigate liquid releases.\n\nFHR Camilla keeps a variety of technical documents onsite that are used to help maintain safe operation of the production process and provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nFHR Camilla is responsible for developing and implementing written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the RMP. The operating procedures were developed as a guide for those involved with initial start-up, normal operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown of the process. FHR Camilla developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in facility operations. \n\nContractors\n\nFHR Camilla's contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures. Prior to awarding contracts, an FHR Camilla representative evaluates the prior safety performance of any prospective contractor. After the contractor has been selected, the FHR Camilla represe"

At that time, FHR reviews known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards that are related to the contractor's work and the covered process. The contract employer representative is also informed of the applicable provisions of the emergency action plan, conditions regarding entrance to the process and the applicable safe work practices that must be followed in order to work at the site. Because contractors may work on or near the process equipment, FHR Camilla has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, and are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nAs part of the management of change (MOC) process, whenever a modification to the existing process is planned, either temporary or permanent, FHR Camilla requires a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). The PSSR confirms that, prior to putting into service, the construction and equipment being used is in accordance with design specifications. The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate training for each involved employee has been completed. A PSSR includes field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFHR Camilla's mechanical integrity program was developed as part of RMP that defines requirements for ensuring the integrity of process equipment. Written procedures help ensure the safe implementation of maintenance activities thus promoting the reliability and integrity of process equipment. This program also includes training, regular inspections and equipment testing. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nFHR Camilla has safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.

Emergency Response Program\n\nAs discussed above, FHR Camilla maintains a written ERAP. The purpose of these documents is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. These documents address aspects of emergency response, step-by-step emergency situation assessments, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident requirements. In addition, FHR Camilla has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures according to their role at the site, so that they are prepared and capable to respond up to incipient level fires or spills incident potentials. FHR Camilla works with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of the site plans. The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFHR Camilla has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction and process safety requirements. FHR Camilla continually reviews safety practices and equipment, and maintenance programs are monitored on an ongoing basis. \n\n"
