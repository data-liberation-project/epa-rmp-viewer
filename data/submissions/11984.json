      "SummaryText": "Employees at Craig Supply Co. are encouraged to use utmost care in handling anhydrous ammonia and other chemicals.  Safety equipment is provided for all employees and they are encouraged daily to use it. Valve, hoses, lines, and all other handling equipment are to be inspected daily. Management is to be contacted imediately if there is a problem with any equipment.  Safety meetings are held to review safety procedures and employees are expected to follow them.  No one is permitted to use transfering equipment unless they are properly trained and wearing safety equipment.\n\nIf there is an accidental release of reportable quantity, employees are to contact management imediately so that proper authorities and response personel can be contacted.  If there is a major release, Craig Supply Co. employees will not respond because we do not have the proper personal protective equipment to handle a major release.  Holt County LEPC has drills so that personel responding to such an incident are properly trained how to handle such a situation.\n\nCraig Supply Co. is a retail business for agricultural products.  We sell chemicals, seed, liquid and dry fertilizer, and anhydrous ammonia for a nitrogen source for corn production.  We also provide custom application of fertilizer and chemicals.\n\nIn our worst case release scenario we have described what would take place if one of our two 30,000 gallon storage tanks would rupture and all of it contents would be released in ten minutes.  Our tanks are never to be filled over 80%, so there would not be more than 115,000 pounds of material released.  There would be an offsite impact of about 3.6 miles in a radius of our plant.  Approximately 507 people would need to be evacuated from this 3.6 mile radius.\n\nIn our alternative scenario we have described what would be a more realistic situation that would happen if a hose would rupture.  Excess flow devices are in place so if this takes place they will automaticly shut off and stop the flow.  I"

      "SummaryText": "f this would take place, considering the size of hose we use and the pressure in the tank, no more than 1800 pounds of product would be released.  There would be an offsite impact of approximately 0.3 miles in radius of our plant.  Approximately 336 people would need to be evacuated from this 0.3 mile radius.\n\nWe purchased the anhydrous ammonia plant in September of 1995.  Since that time there has not been an accidental release or reportable accident to date.\n\nPreventive maintenance is a continual process.  Hoses and valves are check daily for wear and replaced as needed.  All hoses have the date stamped on them they are to be taken out of service.  Lines are also checked for leaks or possible failures.\n\nIn the future we will continue to stress training and use of safety measures.  There might also be a possibility the plant might be moved out of the city limits to reduce risk to residents of the city."
