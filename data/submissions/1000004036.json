The Facility Policy for Lake County Co-op\nThe owners, management, and employees of Lake County Coop are committed to prevention and accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nB. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into\nmixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nC. The maximum quantity stored in all nurse tanks is 191869 lbs., the maximum quantity stored in Bulk Storage is 139914 lbs., and the total maximum amount stored is 331783 lbs.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\na. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140000 lbs., which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K41.1\", published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.1 11, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". This facility has also complied with the Ammonia Law regulated by the Office of the State Chemist.\n\n5. The five-year Accident History\nThere has been NO RELEASE"
