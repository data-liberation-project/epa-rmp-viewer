The Aloha software package was used for the modeling.\n\nA release of this type would activate the comprehensive City of Troy, Department of Public Utilities, Chlorine Emergency Action Plan, and would involve the City of Troy HAZMAT Team, which also serves as the Rensselaer County HAZMAT Team.\n\nAlternate release scenarios involve a leak on a pigtail of the ton chlorine container.   Such a leak could involve a complete shearing of the pigtail, with a release of up to 400 pounds of chlorine before the container freezes up.  Operating procedures do not allow more than one container to be turned on per scale at a time.  Therefore, these scenarios involve less than half of a container leaking due to the freeze up.   Such releases within the building would have complete containment in the building, with no offsite impact expected.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Steps\n\nThe City of Troy, Department of Public Utilities, complies with the rules and regulations as put forth by the New York State Department of Labor through the Public Employees Safety and Health Bureau.  The rules and regulations are NYS Public Employee Safety and Health (PESH) which are modeled after OSHA.  This includes as examples, the Chlorine Emergency Action Plan, and the Right-to-Know Law utilizing the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  \n\nThe Department also provides chlorine training for the water treatment plant operators multiple times per year. The training includes, but is not limited to operational procedures, self contained breathing apparatus familiarity, the Chlorine Institute B repair kit familiarity, feed equipment procedures, and general chlorine safety practices.\n\nThe facilities are equipped with technological equipment for feeding chlorine, monitoring its use and detecting releases.\n\nFive-year Accident History \n\nThere has been no accidental release of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Chlorine Emergency"

It is reviewed by water treatment plant personnel as part of the ongoing training program.\n\nPeriodic discussions are held between the Rensselaer County Bureau of Emergency Services, the City of Troy Fire Department (HAZMAT Team) and the Department of Public Utilities regarding the plan and chlorine safety.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Troy is receiving funding through the New York Drinking Water State Revolving Fund to upgrade the water system.  As part of that project, the instrumentation at the WTP will be upgraded and a new computer control system will be installed.  Parts of the chlorine system will be automated and monitoring and alarms systems will be improved, and incorporated into the system.  Training and procedures will be reviewed and revised as required.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the City of Troy, Department of Public Utilities is aware of the dangers of chlorine, its use in the water works industry remains a necessity.  The City strives to make its use safe for the employees, the water consumers, and the surrounding residents."

Buckley Water Treatment Plant went into operation in 1966, been very concerned with chemical safety, especially chlorine safety.  Over the first ten years of operation of the water treatment plant, chlorine safety policies and procedures were developed and implemented.  These policies and procedures are continually revised and refined.  As new administrations have come to City Hall, each has supported the commitment to chlorine safety.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Description\n\nThe City of Troy, Department of Public Utilities, is responsible for the public water supply for the City and several surrounding communities.  The water is treated at the John P. Buckley Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The plant is a full-scale conventional water plant, manned 24 hours per day, treating an average of 18 MGD.  Chlorine, which is the regulated chemical, is used as a disinfectant at the plant. Prior to the water being treated at the WTP, it is pre-disinfected with chlorine at the Melrose Chlorination Station.  The station is located six miles Northeast of the WTP.  The station is an unmanned facility that is attended to by the water plant operators several times per day.  The chlorine is purchased in one ton containers and is extracted and fed as a gas.  A total of nearly 400 pounds per day is used.  Up to ten containers may be onsite at a time.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves failure of one of the fusible plugs on the ton chlorine container.   It is projected as emptying the container in ten minutes, or leaking at the rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The worst-case release scenario is predicated on a release from only one container.  Even though it is expected that any leak would be contained within the building, the model does i"
