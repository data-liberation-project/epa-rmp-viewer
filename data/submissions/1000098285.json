Forklifts are used to unload the drums from trailers at the loading dock. The drums are stored in the warehouse and segregated based on hazard and compatibility.\n\n\n\nMaximum Quantity Stored at Facility\n\nAmmonia 30% (50,000 LB / 75 55-gal drums)\n\nCyclohexylamine (25,000 LB / 62 55-gal drums\n\nEthylenediamine (50,000 LB / 125 55-gal drums)\n\nStorage Containers: 55-gal drums\n\n\n\nVolume Capacity of Secondary Containment\n\nDrums are stored in a 102,830 sq. ft. indoor warehouse which keeps releases inside the building.\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source and General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nAs an active member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors, we maintain a documented program, The Responsible Distribution Process. With a focus on safety and environmental control, it includes SOPs, personnel training/competency requirements; Emergency Response Plans. Handlers are trained certified to operate forklifts and trained in spill response.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History (40 CFR ?68.42, ?68.168)\n\nThere have been no accidents at this facility with any of the regulated substances in the last five years. NAICS Code: 424690\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program (40 CFR ?68.95)\n\nA Consolidated Contingency Plan is filed with the LA County Fire Department in accordance with California regulations using CERS (California Environmental Reporting System).\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Emergency Response Plan is mai"

      "SummaryText": "ntained for use by the Facility Emergency Response authorities. \n\n\n\nAll operations personnel (i.e. warehouse, production, drivers) are trained and certified to no less than HAZWOPER First Responder Awareness level. Some personnel are trained and certified to the HAZWOPER 40-hour level. Office personnel are trained to HAZWOPER First Responder Awareness Level.\n\n\n\nIn response to a leak, spill, fire, explosion or airborne release, our Emergency Response Plan (tested annually) is activated using dedicated emergency equipment (pre-placed Spill Kits), and calling in our Response Contractor as required. Plant operators involved in handling operations are assigned a full-face respirator and use a chemical-resistant suit and gloves when there is an incident. They are also trained in spill response; are respirator trained and fit-tested annually. They complete a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) annually at the clinic. The objective in response is to: protect personnel; control or contain any release; decontamination and waste disposal. \n\n\n\nThe facility responds to incidental and non-incidental releases. When the release is non-incidental, the Fire Dept. is notified. This also occurs for any fire situation.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (19 CCR ?2745.3; 40 CFR ?68.155)\n\nIncrease the number of personnel that are HAZWOPER trained and certified.\n\n"
