Some personnel are trained and certified to the HAZWOPER 40-hour level. Office personnel are trained to HAZWOPER First Responder Awareness Level.\r\n\r\nIn response to a leak, spill, fire, explosion or airborne release, our Emergency Response Plan (tested annually) is activated using dedicated emergency equipment (pre-placed Spill Kits), and calling in our Response Contractor as required. Plant operators involved in handling operations are assigned a full-face respirator and use a chemical-resistant suit and gloves when there is an incident. They are also trained in spill response; are respirator trained and fit-tested annually. They complete a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) annually at the clinic. The objective in response is to: protect personnel; control or contain any release; decontamination and waste disposal. \r\n\r\nThe facility responds to incidental and non-incidental releases. When the release is non-incidental, the Fire Dept. is notified. This also occurs for any fire situation.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (19 CCR \u00a72745.3; 40 CFR \u00a768.155)\r\nIncrease the number of personnel that are HAZWOPER trained and certified."
