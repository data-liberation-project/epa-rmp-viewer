Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nKiolbassa Provision Company is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. Kiolbassa Provision Company believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. We have an emergency preparedness program to be prepared to work with the San Antonio Fire Department to minimize the potential impacts and notify the public of any actions necessary should an accidental release occur.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Kiolbassa Provision Company San Antonio, Texas facility has an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and cold storage. Ammonia is the only substance present above the RMP threshold quantity. \n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nWe are careful to understand the hazards of ammonia and safely manage it. Our policies and programs call for preventing accidental releases, safely mitigating them on-site through early identification if possible and being prepared in the event of an emergency to minimize the effects on employees and the public.  To ensure that a release does not occur, the Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program encompassing the twelve elements of both EPA RMP and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. A risk management team, consisting of qualified personnel located onsite and at regional offices, is accountable for implementation, enforcement and oversight of the above elements of the release prevention program.\n\nIn addition to the above referenced EPA and OSHA prevention programs, chemical-specific prevention steps include:\n\n> System instruments and alarms to rapidly a"

Five year accident history\n\nIn the last five years, the Kiolbassa Provision Company facility has not experienced any significant accidental ammonia releases that resulted in injuries or property damage. The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major anhydrous ammonia release that could have had adverse effects on the public.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Preparedness and Response\n\nThe Kiolbassa Provision Company recognizes that swift, efficient actions can minimize the potential for injury in the event of an accidental release.  Our emergency preparedness program includes an Emergency Action Plan and training to ensure that employees quickly recognize a release, assess whether they can safely abate it and immediately notify the San Antonio Fire Department in the event of an emergency.  We coordinate site emergency response with the San Antonio Fire Department to ensure that they are familiar with the facility and its use of ammonia.  If such an emergency did occur, plant personnel would contact the San Antonio Fire Department, who would dispatch specially trained personnel to the facility to respond and, if necessary, notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection. \n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Maintaining a Safe Operation\n\nWe have already installed controls and protective systems to meet refrigeration system industry design safety standards and applicable regulations and continually work to safely manage chemical hazards to protect ou"

We continue this process on an ongoing basis.\n\n"
