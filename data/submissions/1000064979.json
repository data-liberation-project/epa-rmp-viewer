The flare catcher is designed to process associated gas and recovered tank vapors by physical separation and cryogenic means.  The flare catcher is considered a small natural gas processing plant for regulatory purposes. NGLs recovered from this process are marketed for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nPioneer has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the company's efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process. Pioneer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within their capabilities, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe T&M DE22039HC site is located approximately one and a half miles northwest of Pierce, Colorado off of Highway 85 (about sixty-four miles northeast of Denver, Colorado) and operates the flare catcher process to produce the following products:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as NGLs)\n\n2. Light Gas\n\n\n\nThe NGL product contains ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThere is one worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable"

The WCS results in the largest impacted area with a 0.3-mile radius.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located within an agricultural unpopulated area; therefore, the WCS would not affect a public or environmental receptor and is considered a Program 1 process.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe T&M DE22039HC site is not covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since it can be operated remotely and Pioneer does not keep employees at its location. Pioneer maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Use of these standard Operating Procedures will be used to aid in accident release prevention. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe T&M DE22039HC site is a new facility.  There have been no accidental releases from a covered process that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe T&M DE22039HC site is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The company maintains written emergency procedures, which are in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  These procedures identify steps to be taken in case of an accidental release. However, The T&M DE22039HC site is an unmanned location and company personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nThe T&M DE22039HC site has around-the-clock com"

This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nRMP MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\nPioneer has assigned responsibility for the risk management program to the Vice President of International Business and maintains a management system to oversee program elements.\n\n \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\n\n\nThere are currently no planned changes to improve safety. Rather, the company believes that diligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework that allows for the continued improvement to the level of safety at the T&M DE22039HC site. Some of the key components of the program that will help maintain and, where applicable, improve safety are:\n\n\n\nEnsuring that Pioneer considers the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n\n\nThe hazard review provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards. \n\n\n\nEnsuring that equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous release thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that Pioneer maintains and increases the level of safety protection.\n\n"
