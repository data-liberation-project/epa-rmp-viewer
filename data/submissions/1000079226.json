Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nThe Ashland LLC facility located in Piedmont, South Carolina contains one RMP covered process which is a vinyl acetate polymer emulsions manufacturing plant.  The plant maintains greater than 10,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) to safely and efficiently manufacture polyvinyl acetate copolymer emulsions.  In the quantities handled by our facility, vinyl acetate monomer is considered to be hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations as well as our internal environmental, health and safety policies, practices and standards.\n\nAshland LLC manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent safety in the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant. \n\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA's HazWOPER regulations.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire department so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nAshland is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  Ashland is a member of the American Chemical Council and subscribes to the Responsible Care Program.  The Piedmont facility is actively involved in the community through its work with the local Greenville County CAER Group, the Piedmont Fire Department, the Greenville County LEPC and the Piedmont Community Advisory Panel.\n\n2.

To produce polyvinyl acetate copolymer, an emulsion, vinyl acetate liquid is polymerized with other monomers in reactors to form the emulsion product.  The emulsion product is a non-hazardous, water based liquid.  The product is shipped via railcars, tank truck, totes and drums to industrial customers for the production of paint products, paper coatings and adhesives.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Ashland manages the safety of the facility by designing for safe operation, by operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing the operations.\n\nThe facility is designed for safe operation through the use of emergency shutdown systems and alarms, fail-safe valves and dikes for the unlikely case of a potential leak.  Systems and equipment are designed to engineering standards and codes.  Safety reviews are conducted prior to start-up on all projects and process changes.\n\nThe plant is operated safely by trained and certified operators who follow standard operating procedures that contain defined safe operating limits. Routine safety meetings are held for all operating personnel and all incidents are investigated to prevent recurrence.\n\nOperational safety is maintained through preventive maintenance and equipment inspection programs.  Contractors are held to the same high safety training standards as our employees.   Operations are routinely audited for compliance with federal, state and local regulations.   Management reviews and drives resolution of all audit findings.\n\n4.

At a minimum, all employees are trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness level.  Employees are trained to recognize emergencies and to initiate an emergency response from outside agencies.  The facility also has a core group of employees who are trained to the Technician Level of HazWOPER.  Employees receive annual refresher training in emergency response procedures.  \n\nEmergency response activities have been coordinated with the Piedmont Fire Department and Greenville County HazMat Team for awareness on potential hazards and location of hazardous materials.  Drills are also conducted periodically in order to assure the effectiveness of the response procedures.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.\n\n"
