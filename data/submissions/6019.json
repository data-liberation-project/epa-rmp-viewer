EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nInland Eastex is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Inland Eastex employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Inland Eastex has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage risks at Inland Eastex, and also complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Inland Eastex.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Inland Eastex.\n\nThe risk management program at Inland Eastex consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand:\n (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases\n (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances\n       regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at Inland Eastex helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at Inland Eastex.  In fact, Inland Eastex has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many le"

Before using a hazardous substance at Inland Eastex, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at Inland Eastex, Inland Eastex considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect Inland Eastex employees, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nInland Eastex prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at Inland Eastex, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nInland Eastex limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Inland Eastex trains employees to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, Inland Eastex works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur if a release does occur.\nThe safety program at Inland Eastex consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Inland Eastex that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nInland Eastex is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Inland Eastex implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installat"

Inland Eastex also provides response training to employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates efforts with local emergency planning and response organizations.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\n\n1.2\tInland Eastex and Regulated Substances\n\nInland Eastex is an integrated pulp and paperboard mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached paperboard products.  As part of this manufacturing process, Inland Eastex handles several regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes.\n\n\nProcess                                Program Level                Regulated Substance              Process Quantity\nMonox-L Generation                      3                                    Chlorine                                 180,000 lb.\nWater Treatment/Chlorine              3                                    Chlorine                                 180,000 lb.\nChlorine Dioxide Generation          3                                    Chlorine Dioxide                         7,844 lb.\n    and Storage\n\n\n1.3\tOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nInland Eastex performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public of the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Inland Eastex does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee i"

Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\nk.\tHot Work Permits.  Inland Eastex established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame- producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Inland Eastex facility.  Inland Eastex reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Operating Supervisor/Construction Coordinator/Team Leader reviews the completed form and work area then signs form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the Inland Eastex safe work practices orientation.\n\nl.\tContractors.  Inland Eastex established a program to help ensure that the contractor activities at the Inland Eastex facility are performed in a safe manner.

An alternative release scenario represents a release that:\n\t(1)\tmight occur at a facility like Inland Eastex\n\t(2)\twould result in a conservative estimate of potential offsite consequences if the release occurred\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Inland Eastex.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3\n  processes (i.e., one scenario representing both chlorine and chlorine dioxide)\n\n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n  (i.e., chlorine and chlorine dioxide)\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by Inland Eastex.\n\n 1.3.1\tProgram 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release for toxic substances is rupture of a tank car of 90-tons of chlorine, which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is greater than 25 miles.  The U.S. Census indicates that 242,313 people live within the 25-mile radius from the storage vessel.

The primary environmental receptors within the 25 mile radius per USGS maps are Big Thicket National Preserve, E.O. Siecke State Forest, and Sabine Island State Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is the rupture of a 1\" liquid unloading line from a 90-ton tank car.  This scenario assumes active mitigation from tank car's built-in excess flow valve, which restricts the release to one that is instantaneous in nature.  It is also assumed that this release requires approximately 30 minutes for workers to discover and isolate the ruptured hose.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.1 miles.  As many as 2,221 people offsite (U.S. Census data indicates approximately 1,406 local residents) could be impacted within this 2.1-mile radius.  Several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g., the local school, the Pinefield subdivision, the Inland Eastex park baseball field, and several small businesses).  No environmental receptors are within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is shearing off a one-inch sample line on the discharge of a chlorine dioxide solution (1wt%) pump that transfers solution to/from the chlorine dioxide absorber to storage.   This scenario assumes that the solution is released through the hole for the 60 minutes before workers detect the release and isolate the line.  The released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.1 miles.  As many as 1,626 people offsite (U.S. Census data indicates approximately 811 local residents) could be impacted within this 1.1-mile radius.

Beginning in 1992, Inland Eastex formalized this prevention program for the Water Treatment/Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes to comply with the 13 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established prevention program requirements:\n\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of Inland Eastex's prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n 1.4.1\tProgram 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Inland Eastex Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the Monox-L Generation, Water Treatment/Chlorine and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\na.\tProcess Safety Information.  Inland Eastex maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the Inland Eastex processes.  These documents address:\n(1)\tphysical properties of hazardous substances handled at Inland Eastex\n(2)\toperating parameters of the equipment at Inland Eastex\n(3)\tdesign basis and configuration of the equipment at Inland Eastex.\n\nInland Eastex ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the fire department.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Inland Eastex, including regulated substances in covered processes.

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nChlorine.  Chlorine is supplied in DOT-approved 90-ton rail tank cars, 1-ton cylinders, and 150-lb cylinders.  Chlorine is used for water treatment and for preparation of a bleaching chemical, Monox-L.  \n\nFor water treatment, chlorine gas is fed through a short length of piping to an eductor, where it is absorbed into process water for use in the water treatment unit.  The length of piping containing chlorine is kept to a minimum to reduce the likelihood of a release.  If a release occurs downstream of the regulator at the cylinder, the regulator will close and only the quantity in the piping will be released.  This quantity is small because of the short pipe in length and the vacuum conditions inside the piping.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in most areas containing chlorine.\n\nFor Monox-L preparations, liquid chlorine is vaporized to chlorine gas prior to reacting with other chemicals.  Operators via remote TV cameras constantly monitor rail tank car unloading.  Chlorine detectors and alarms provide an immediate warning of any release.\n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Inland Eastex facility and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where it is mixed with chilled water and a 1 wt% chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.\n \n\n\n1.5\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nInland Eastex has completed a five-year accident history that has shown an improvement ove"

The number of accidental releases declined from a peak of 18 in 1997 to 10 in 1998 and show continuous decline in 1999.\n\nThe most significant incident in the past five years was on May 22, 1997.  Release was due to a broken electrical wire to a caustic makeup valve, which caused a loss of caustic to a scrubber resulting in a release of 7-9 pounds of chlorine.  Incident resulted in 7 OSHA's and 1 first aid.  An accident investigation team was assembled in accordance with the investigation protocol.  The team recommended and implemented several improvements to eliminate the potential of this in the future.\n\nSince 1994, there have been 7 OSHA's and 23 first aid cases involving both contractors and inland employees due to inhalation or skin contact with either chlorine or chlorine dioxide.  The records for releases for the 5-year period prior to June 1999 show a total of 46.  There is no record of offsite consequences in the past 5-years. \n\n\n1.6\tEmergency Response Programs\n\nInland Eastex has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n7 informing the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in \n  offsite consequences\n\n7 providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to \n  hazardous substances at Inland Eastex\n\n7 controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency \n  response equipment\n\n7 inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n\n7 reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\nInland Eastex maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.

Inland Eastex maintains a regular dialogue with the local emergency planning and response organizations.\n\n\n1.7\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nInland Eastex constantly strives to improve safety in all areas including covered processes.  Improvements in incident investigations and employee involvement with processes such as our behavior process (Hero:  Hazards Eliminated through Routine Observations) and continued aggression in our Standing Safety Committee.  The PSM Program will continue to improve due to full time coordinator and continual evaluation by a team of diversified talent.  \n\n7 Inland Eastex reviewed the chlorine handling system, increased the inspection frequency for chlorine equipment, added TV cameras and chlorine detectors for remote observations, and took steps to decrease the traffic near chlorine equipment - these changes reduce the likelihood of a chlorine release caused by degraded equipment or external impact\n\n7 A new chlorine dioxide generating facility, currently under construction will eliminate the chlorine requirements for generating Monox-L, which will also eliminate the use of chlorine as part of that generation."
