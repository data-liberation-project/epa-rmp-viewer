      "SummaryText": "Gold Medal Bagel Bakery manufactures a variety of bagels at our bakery in West Haven, Connecticut. We have produced bagels in West Haven since 2000. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration systems. Similar to the function freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our industrial freezers and product coolers. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\nA.  Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies.\n\nGold Medal takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Engineering Manager is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nGold Medal Bagel Bakery produces fresh and frozen bagels for sale to the public. The facility operates a refrigeration system with an ammonia inventory of approximately 23,500 pounds. Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the West Haven Plant.\n\n\nC.  Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\nEPA requires us to define the worst-case scenario from the West Haven plant as "

      "SummaryText": "the release of all the ammonia form the largest vessel on-site. At our West Haven plant, this would be 14,000 pounds of ammonia over a 29-minute period due to the failure of the high pressure receiver. The 14,000 pounds represents the maximum amount of ammonia that would be contained in the receiver at any time. This receiver is located inside a building, which would reduce the impact of a release. EPA also requires us to assume that the weather conditions are such that there is almost no wind and no mixing in the atmosphere.\n\nThe alternative release scenario at the West Haven plant would involve the release of 250 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to a release form a low-pressure receiver damages by a vehicular accident. The duration of the release was estimated for the alternative scenario by determining the amount of time needed to empty this receiver. Again, EPA requires us to assume that the weather conditions are such that there is almost no wind and no mixing in the atmosphere.\n\nBoth of these releases are unlikely for many reasons. Our equipment and system were designed using the industry standards for ammonia refrigeration. We have taken precautions to protect our equipment from obvious threats, like unauthorized access. We have a preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the refrigeration equipment. Training programs are in place to ensure that qualified personnel operate the systems, and our emergency response procedures allow us to respond quickly in the event of an accident.\n\n\nD.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act?s Process Safety Management Standard and EPA?s Risk Management Program Regulation. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n? Employee Participation Program\n? Process Safety Information\n? Process Hazard Analysis\n? Operating Procedures\n? Training Program\n?"

Incident Investigation Procedures\n? Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\nE.  Five Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no ammonia-related accidents at the West Haven plant in the past five years.\n\n\nF.  Description of the Emergency Response Program.\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the West Haven Plant. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe plant response team utilizes employees and our refrigeration contractor who are trained to enter and stop an accidental ammonia release. This team meets regularly for training and practice drills. In September of 1998, we performed a practice drill with the West Haven Fire Department.\n\n\nG.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nGold Medal Bagel Bakery is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner. We are continuously evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective. Planned improvements include installation of a deluge system to prevent fugitive ammonia releases."
