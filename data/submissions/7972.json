      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the LaRoche - Geneva Nitrogen Plant\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LaRoche Industries, Inc. - Geneva Nitrogen Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nWe also have a thorough emergency response plan in place in which our employees and local responders are familiar with through periodic training.  Should a release occur that requires emergency response, the Utah county Emergency Coordinator and the Orem Fire Department stand ready to work with us to implement this plan and provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Manufacturing of Nitric Acid and Ammonium Nitrate.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)].  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used to manufacture both Nitric Acid (< 80 percent) and Ammonia Nitrate.  Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)] is used to manufacture Nitric Acid (<80 percent).\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 8,561,724 lb.(4,281 tons) while Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)] is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 9 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance"

      "SummaryText": " Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer Process.  In this scenario 4,200,000 lb. (2,100 tons) of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has not been limited by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer Process.  The scenario involves the release of 420,000 lb. (210 tons) of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 3.4 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the United States Steel Corporation Design Codes. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source for the Program 3 processes at our plant: 1) the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer Process.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLaRoche Industries, Inc. - Geneva Nitrogen Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemi"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/18/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LaRoche Industries, Inc. - Geneva Nitrogen Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLaRoche Industries, Inc. - Geneva Nitrogen Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLaRoche Industries, Inc. - Geneva Nitrogen Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
