      "SummaryText": "Peninsula Fruit Exchange (PFE) is committed to the occupational and environmental chemical safety at its facility.  Occupational safety is achieved through compliance with Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 1910, Part 119, \"Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals\" (29CFR1910.119) as adopted in Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Association (MIOSHA) Part 91, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals,\" and other applicable MIOSHA standards.  Environmental safety is achieved through compliance with Title 40 of the CFR, Section 68, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (40CFR68) and Title 42 of the United States Code (USC), Chapter 85, Section 7412, \"Hazardous Air Pollutants\" (42USC85.7412), more commonly known as Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  All parties at PFE are committed to the safety of its processes from the ownership and Plant Manager down to individual contributors.\n\n\n\nPFE is a sweet cherry brining facility.  A brine solution is prepared and distributed to a number of brine tanks just prior to sweet cherry harvest each year.  The amount of brine prepared is based on the supplying growers' crop estimates.  Cherries are received and put into brine in the brine tanks as they are received.  The fruit is held in brine for a period of time until it can be processed.  Fruit is sorted for quality, sized, pitted, graded, and shipped to an offsite facility for further processing.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) is used as an ingredient in the brine.  It is received in one-ton compressed gas cylinders before it is mixed into the brine solution.  The minimum amount of sulfur dioxide is ordered to ensure an adequate quantity for production.  The only time that there is a surge in the number of filled sulfur dioxide tanks onsite is just before and during brine preparation, typically in the late June time period just before cherry harvest.  A minimal amount of sulfur dioxide in one-ton cylinders is stored onsi"

The concentration of sulfur dioxide in brine falls below 1% when cherries are added.\n\n\n\nThe processes employed have been in use at PFE for over 60 years.  Systems are simple and open for inspection both before and during operation.  These simple systems minimize potential failure locations and failure modes.\n\n\n\nProcesses are run by a small group of experienced, knowledgeable operators.  Processes are managed by a set of controlled procedures.  Process chemistry is monitored and validated frequently by operators using analytical chemistry techniques.  Procedures and processes are in practice reviewed annually before the start of seasonal activities.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases or incidents with sulfur dioxide in the last five years.  Further, plant personnel cannot recall a reportable release or incident with sulfur dioxide in the past several decades.\n\n\n\nPFE maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) approved by the Grand Traverse County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Peninsula Township Fire Department (FD).  The plan includes pre-established mutual aid agreements (MAA) with the Traverse City FD and Grand Traverse Metro FD to ensure adequate resources and expertise are available.  Responders are trained, informed, and equipped to respond to an event.\n\n\n\nThe sulfur dioxide cylinder storage location is isolated and contained.  Discharge from a cylinder is the only significant plausible release to offsite locations because sulfur dioxide is kept in solution well below saturation in all brine mixes.\n\n\n\nPFE continues to review and update its occupational safety and environmental programs for compliance and best practices.  The facility and its personnel are committed to making the facility as safe as possible using simple, common sense methods, and complying with regulations.  This continuous improvement approach has been effective in protecting employees, the community, and the environment.\n\n"
