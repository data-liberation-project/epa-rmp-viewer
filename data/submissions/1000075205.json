A primary aspect of this commitment is the EP Pine Bluff system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, and by the extensive training of our operating personnel. \r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, EP Pine Bluff will implement procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  EP Pine Bluff's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  A Safety & Health Manager has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) served to support the original preparation of this plan and policies.\r\n\r\nTo effectively implement these policies, EP Pine Bluff established a management system headed by the Manager of Environmental Health and Safety to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\n2.0  REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nEP Pine Bluff is primarily involved in the manufacture of high-quality bleached paperboard.  To manufacture our products, EP Pine Bluff utilizes one substance, chlorine dioxide, which is regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (the Rule) contained in 40 CFR 68.  The chlorine dioxide used at EP Pine Bluff is generated on site, immediately absorbed into water, and then stored in a 1.05% solution.  The Rule requires that all regulated toxic substances stored in quantities above the spe"

Chlorine dioxide is present in an aqueous solution in storage tanks above the threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide is also used in the water treatment process.  This process uses a blend of purate (sodium chlorate and hydrogen peroxide) and sulfuric acid to produce chlorine dioxide for immediate use. There is no chlorine dioxide stored for this process; therefore, this chlorine dioxide process is not covered by the Rule.\r\n\r\nThe regulated use of chlorine dioxide at EP Pine Bluff is as follows:\r\n\r\nTable 1.

Chlorine dioxide was evaluated for possible worse case and alternative release scenarios.  It is important to understand that EP Pine Bluff has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenarios, though also highly unlikely, present a more realistic potential for occurrence and are based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, EP Pine Bluff has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \"Prevention Program\" section of this plan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be affected in the event of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater.  The offsite consequence analysis can be found within the Hazard A"

The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to Program 3 Prevention Program requirements of the Rule.  The Prevention Program for the Chlorine Dioxide System is well developed and was in place prior to the implementation of the Rule.\r\n\r\nThe Chlorine Dioxide System Prevention Program consists of the following twelve elements.\r\n\r\n4.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nEP Pine Bluff maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\r\n\u00bf\tphysical properties of hazardous substances handled,\r\n\u00bf\tchemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\r\n\u00bf\toperating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\r\n\u00bf\tdesign basis and configuration of the equipment, and\r\n\u00bf\tspecific chemical inventories.\r\n\r\nEP Pine Bluff ensures the process safety information is available to all mill employees, the LEPC, and the local fire department and that the process safety information is kept up to date.  The Safety & Health Manager is responsible for maintaining and updating this information as needed.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.
