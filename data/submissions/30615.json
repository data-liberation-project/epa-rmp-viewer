The Mustang Gas Plant has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented. This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC). This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes. MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change. A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification. A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRS) \n\nThe Mustang Gas Plant Personnel conduct a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
