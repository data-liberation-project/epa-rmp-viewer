      "SummaryText": "The Town of North Wilkesboro owns and operates a 6 MGD water treatment plant supplied by a low water intake on the ReReddies River. The plant is located in the northwest part of Town. Chlorine is delivered and stored at the plant in ton containers. No more than six (6) ton containers are onsite at once. Chlorine is fed to the treatment process directly from the ton containers via a vacuum feed type system and is pressurized only in the ton delivery containers.\n\nThe Town is considering the following alternatives to mitigate or eliminate the potential impact of a worse or alternative case gaseous chlorine release at the water treatment plant:\n\n     1. automated chlorine emergency scrubber system\n     2. proprietary Miox system for onsite chlorine generation\n     3. sodium hypochlorite (liquid bleach) storage and feed system\n\nEvaluation of these alternatives is not complete. Alternative 1 would provide an additional passive mitigation measure to be included in the next RMP update. Alternatives 2 or 3 would allow the water treatment plant to go from a Program 3 to a Program 1and be de-registered at that time."
