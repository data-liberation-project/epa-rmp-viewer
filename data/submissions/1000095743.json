Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nINEOS Oxide, a Division of INEOS Americas LLC (INEOS) L.L.C. - Plaquemine, Louisiana Operations (INEOS) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. As an integral part of this commitment, INEOS has developed and implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, emergency response and employee training associated with the processes at its Plaquemine, Louisiana facility. This program complies with all of the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" and Chapter 59 of LAC 33:III, \"Chemical Accident Prevention and Minimization of Consequences\".\r\n\r\nIt is INEOS' policy to always operate the manufacturing processes in a safe manner and according to established procedures and good engineering and management practices. As part of this policy, INEOS has established the appropriate management and administrative controls for the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that such a release may occur, trained emergency response personnel are available on site to take the necessary and appropriate corrective action to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\nINEOS has also established lines of communication with the Iberville Parish Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), in the event that an accidental chemical release may have beyond-the-fence line effects and for additional emergency response expertise that may be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Specifically, INEOS owns and operates the Ethanolamine Unit and operates the Glycol Ether and Polyethylene Glycol Units for DOW. The three production units that now comprise the INEOS facility, manufacture approximately 18 different ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivatives used in a wide variety of consumer products such as antifreeze, shampoo ingredients, automotive fluids, cosmetics, and water purification chemicals.\r\n\r\nINEOS uses a few organic chemicals as raw materials, including ethylene and propylene oxides, methanol, n-Butanol and ethylene glycol. Inorganic chemicals used in the process include phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide and ammonia, among others. \r\n\r\nNone of the products and byproducts manufactured at the INEOS facility are regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) established by Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The only RMP-regulated substances present at INEOS, above the RMP threshold quantities, are Anhydrous and Aqueous Ammonia. Ethylene Oxide [Oxirane] and Propylene Oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] are both used as raw materials in the INEOS processes, but are received by pipeline from nearby DOW facilities on a continuous basis and as needed in the chemical manufacturing processes. Consequently, there are no storage facilities for these two chemicals within the INEOS Block 55 perimeter.\r\n\r\nMaximum inventories and threshold quantities for RMP-regulated substances at the INEOS facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana are shown below.\r\n\r\nRMP Regulated Substance Inventory Quantities (lbs):\r\nAmmonia (Anhydrous) (24-hr.

Quantities of these chemicals on-site do not exceed the RMP threshold quantities. The amounts shown are the volumes of the existing in-line surge drums.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received on-site via pipeline from a 3rd party contractor.  It is stored under pressure in a spherical tank (DS-205) until being pumped into the process. DS-205 has a gross storage capacity of approximately 750,000 lbs. of ammonia, but the necessary administrative controls (written operating procedures and level controls and alarms) are in place to limit the maximum amount of ammonia in the tank to 500,000 lbs. DS-205 has no refrigeration, therefore the material is kept under pressure usually between 75-85 degrees F. The vapor pressure of anhydrous ammonia in this temperature range is between 140 and 180 psia.\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is generated on-site when the anhydrous ammonia is mixed with condensate in an ammonia absorber (D-210) in the front end of the plant. The aqueous ammonia is stored in D-210 until being fed to the reactor through a high-pressure pump and piping.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nINEOS has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out by the USEPA under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the INEOS facility. Health and safety procedures are being reviewed and revised as needed by INEOS. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe INEOS facility maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes, including those that involve the regulated chemicals.

These studies included the process units that now comprise the INEOS facility. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses include What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, the DOW Fire and Explosion Index, the DOW Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis (PHA). It is DOW's practice that these studies be undertaken periodically by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and that any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. INEOS management is committed to continue these practices. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the manufacturing processes, INEOS maintains complete and up to date written standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each process. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. The SOPs also discuss potential deviations"

These procedures require, among other things, that process safety considerations be evaluated anytime a process change is considered to evaluate any potential on-site and off-site impacts and whether the change will require a process hazard analysis (PHA) to be conducted.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nProcedures are in place at INEOS to perform Pre-start up safety Reviews related to new processes and to modifications in existing processes.  The purpose of these reviews is not only to confirm that new or modified equipment and systems have been constructed and installed with all the necessary safety features, but also to establish that the operating and maintenance procedures are fully adequate and that they include all of the necessary information for safe startup, before the system is actually placed into operation.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nINEOS will conduct compliance audits on a regular basis to deter"

Compliance audits are performed by qualified third-party independent contractors. \r\n\r\nINEOS conducts these audits at least once every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be addressed in a safe and prompt manner.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation \r\n\r\nINEOS incident investigation procedures were established in compliance with OSHA's PSM requirements. INEOS has adopted these procedures and will promptly investigate any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation, conditions and contributing factors leading to the incident as well as to identify any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of such investigations are:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tto establish the facts relating to the incident,\r\n\u00bf\tto determine the factors causing or contributing, directly or indirectly, to the incident, and\r\n\u00bf\tto define what corrective actions, if any, are necessary to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.\r\n\r\nThe incident investigation team will include members of the staff who are familiar with the process involved in the incident and shall also include personnel from the operations, maintenance and management departments.\r\n\r\nThe investigating team will submit its findings and recommendations to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation report will be tracked until completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results will be reviewed with all employees, including contractors, who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports will be kept on file for a minimum of five years so that they can be reviewed during future process hazard reviews.\r\n\r\nThe incident investigation reports will include, amon"

INEOS's employee participation program is a program developed in compliance with OSHA's PSM requirements, which by definition also complies with the requirements of the RMP program. PHA procedures call for the active participation of INEOS employees. The findings and recommendations resulting from PHA reviews are made available to all employees and are discussed with all employees who work in the affected areas.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, all INEOS employees have access to the information developed and created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from PHA reviews.\r\n&#8195;\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nAs needed, INEOS will hire contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, repairs, construction and various other on-site activities. An integral part of the contractor selection process is a thorough evaluation of each contractor's safety performance and programs. After contracts have been awarded, but before actual work commences, contractor employees who will be performing work inside the plant must undergo, as a condition of the contract, a mandatory safety orientation. As part of this orientation, INEOS will inform the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. C"

Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nINEOS has not experienced any accidental releases of regulated substances within the last five years that were reportable under 40 CFR 68.42(a) (i.e., that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant on-site property damage or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage or environmental damage). \r\n\r\nINEOS has adopted and adheres to strict accident prevention policies; therefore, INEOS will maintain an excellent accident record in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe INEOS facility has developed and implemented an emergency response program that includes and Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and procedures to address and respond to emergencies involving toxic materials.\r\n\r\nThe ERP addresses all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Medical and emergency response support is coordinated with the DOW Plaquemine operations.\r\n\r\nSome of the major topics addressed in the ERP include, but are not limited to,\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tDescription of the uses of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia within the plant, \r\n\u00bf\tPhysical Properties of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia, \r\n\u00bf\tSafety measures that must be taken before working in the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia operational and storage areas,\r\n\u00bf\tDescription of monitoring, warning and alarm systems in the anhydrous and aqueous ammonia operational and storage areas,\r\n\u00bf\tDescription of safety features provided at the anhydrous ammonia storage sphere area,\r\n\u00bf\tPersonnel responsibilities during an ammonia emergency, including local and evacuation alarms, \r\n\u00bf\tList of emergency call numbers to be contacted (local agencies and public), \r\n\u00bf\tProcedures to inform the media and the public about acc"
