Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and emloyees of Environmental Technologies Inc facility at 379 E. 300 S., Jerome\n\nIdaho are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of stored formaldehyde. If an accidental\n\nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to\n\nmitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Jerome facility is the storage of the formaldehyde solution.\n\nThe regulated substance, 37% formaldehyde liquid solution, will be stored in above ground storage tanks and\n\ntransfered to DOT regulated transportation vehicles for delivery to customers. The maximum quantity\n\nof formaldehyde stored at the Jerome location is 31,000 gallons which is stored in 5 seperate above ground\n\nstorage tanks within a containment area.\n\n\n\nThis location has standard operating procedures in place, an inspection and maintenance program, employee\n\ntraining and a completed risk analysis. The risk associated with product transfer and storage is deemed low\n\ncompared to chemical processing locations. \n\n\n\nSince the covered process is restricted to the storage of the product there are no full time employees\n\nassociated directly with this location. However, there are 2 full time employees who work for the location\n\nand assume other duties related to the transporation of the product to customers. As such, their part time\n\navailability at the location will be indicated as 1 full time employee for the site. The storage process is located\n\non the tenents property.\n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented a quarterly documented inspection program of all tank and associated piping.\n\nIn addition, a visual inspection is conducted each time personnel are present at the storage location.\n\nInspection checklist is utilized for the quarterly inspections and a list of items to"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of Formaldehyde in the past five years that:\n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nhave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental\n\ndamage.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis location will be a non-responding facility. Coordination with the LEPC is in place.\n\n\n\nAllowable actions for employees include the following:\n\n\"responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized,\n\nor otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by\n\nmaintenance personnel\"\n\n\"responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard (i.e., fire,\n\nexplosion, or chemical exposure).\"\n\nThe location will utilize services, as required, by Clean Harbors Inc. for spill clean-up and response and/or\n\nother qualified contractors.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the storage location. We will continue to evaluate new technlogy and storage practices to solidify our commitment to safety. Employee and public safety is the first priority.\n\n"
