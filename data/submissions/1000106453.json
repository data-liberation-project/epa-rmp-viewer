      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Mountain TRAX in Evans, Colorado was previously updated in October 2016 by Tetra Tech on behalf of ARB Midstream LLC.  In 2020, Mountain TRAX purchased the ARB Midstream business, and this report has been prepared to satisfy the 5-Year revalidation requirements for RMP.  The RMP rule requires facilities that use extremely hazardous substances to develop a Risk Management Plan which:\n1.\tIdentifies the potential effects of a chemical accident,\n2.\tIdentifies steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident, and\n3.\tSpells out emergency response procedures should an accident occur.\n\nThese plans provide valuable information to local fire, police, and emergency response personnel to prepare for and respond to chemical emergencies in the community. \nFacilities holding more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process (e.g., butane threshold = 10,000 pounds) are required to comply with EPA\u0092s RMP regulations which require owners or operators of covered facilities to implement an RMP at their facility, to submit it to EPA, and update it every 5 years, at a minimum.\n\nThe Mountain TRAX Evans, Colorado facility offloads butane and propane from rail cars to trucks for distribution; the rail cars containing butane and propane are temporarily (which means railcars can be onsite for a few days or up to a year or more) held at the facility in the interim. USEPA and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environmental (CDPHE) considers this rail terminal a stationary source according to the definition provided in \nThe transloading takes place along the rail line in the southern portion of the property, where roads run parallel for truck access. The butane and propane are transferred directly from stationary rail cars to transport trucks through a closed vapor system. Only one railcar is offloaded at a time. The terminal facility maintains four full time employees and approximately 226 acres of railyard space.   \n\nAccording to t"

      "SummaryText": "he Propane/Butane Transloading SOP provided by the Mountain TRAX, an employee gauges the contents of each tank car when it arrives to the site.  The employee reads the tank car\u0092s gauging device to convert the inches of outage to gallons of outage using the Company\u0092s outage gauge table. The outage represents the \u0093empty\u0094 space in the railcar that is filled by gas rather than liquid. The outage in gallons is subtracted from the water capacity of the tank car (33,960 gallons) to determine the gallons of liquid butane or propane in the tank car. This volume is then corrected for temperature and specific gravity by multiplying it by the appropriate volume correction factor as provided by the Mountain TRAX. The final volume is the tank car liquid volume of butane or propane at 60 degrees Fahrenheit; this information is recorded on the Mountain TRAX unloading form. The maximum inventory can never exceed the quantity of flammable liquid gas that was originally in the railcar. The net capacity for liquid butane or propane at 60 degrees Fahrenheit for one railcar is approximately 30,000 gallons. \nThe Mountain TRAX terminal has a maximum intended inventory of approximately 7,247,984 pounds of butane (based on full liquid butane/propane capacity of fifty 30,000-gallon railcars and a butane density of 4.85 pounds per gallon) and approximately 7,060,212 pounds of propane (based on full liquid butane/propane capacity of fifty 30,000-gallon railcars and a propane density of 4.71 pounds per gallon). These are greater than the PSM/RMP threshold quantities for butane storage (10,000 pounds per process) and propane storage (10,000 pounds per process). \nGiven the arrangement of the rail cars, it is likely that they could be involved in a single release (e.g., a fire could spread from one to another); the separate rail cars are co-located as it relates to the definition of process. Therefore, butane and propane storage at Mountain TRAX consists of one covered process under the PSM/RMP reg"
