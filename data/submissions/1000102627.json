CEC will continue calling terminal associates until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation (they will not leave a voice message).\n\nPrior to startup of the regulated process, management from the U.S. Energy Jones Island Terminal conducted face to face to meetings with all Port of Milwaukee Tenants which included educating the tenants on the hazards of butane, evacuation plans, and assembly points.  In addition, the Terminal has internally implemented a web based notification system to enhance internal and external communication in the event of an emergency.  During an emergency, the notification system can be used to communicate critical information including security threats, fires, and chemical releases to the Port of Milwaukee tenants, the Milwaukee Fire Department and Hazmat Team, Milwaukee County Emergency Management, etc.\n\nThe notification system is capable of reaching out to people in minutes.  During an emergency situation, facility trained personnel can send out a notification from the web or a mobile device.  Notifications can be received via email, text, and/or phone depending on each individual preference. Individuals can sign up for any of the notification options when they sign a consent form giving U.S. Energy permission to place them in the system. \n\nThe notification system has been tested with Port of Milwaukee Tenants, Milwaukee Fire and Hazmat, and Milwaukee County Emergency Management.\n\nOur continuous improvement process, inclusive of historic analytics, risk assessments, and corrective/preventive actions, focuses on three primary objectives:\n1.\tSafety of clients, servicers, and community,\n2.\tUp time performance and user experience and,\n3.\t Site cost drivers and reductions through root cause analysis and long term correct"
