Annual average flow through the facility is 1.6 MGD.\nThe chlorination and dechlorination process to disinfect the final effluent requires two hazardous chemicals, Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  Annual consumption of Chlorine for effluent disinfection is approximately 38,000 Lbs.  Annual consumption of Sulfur dioxide for Chlorine deactivation is 24,000 Lbs.  These two hazardous chemicals are the only ones used at this facility and are located approximately one mile from residences or schools.  Chemicals are delivered to the WWTP in TUN cylinders that contain approx. 2,000 Lbs. of product. Maximum storage capacity of Chlorine onsite is 12,000 Lbs.  and  6,000 Lbs of Sulfur Dioxide.\n    There are two WWTP personnel  assigned to replace the cylinders, connect or disconnect feed or vacuum lines.  This crew also makes a daily inventory of chemicals on hand and ensures there is sufficient product on hand to preclude unscheduled changing of cylinders.\n    When in the process of making or breaking connections the crew don respirators equipped with organic vapor cartridges and face shields.  A combination eye wash / deluge shower and mechanical ventilation are available and in proper working order.  If in the course of making connections, a leak develops that (1) cannot be stopped immediately (2) causes spewing, spilling, or pooling of liquid product (3) forms a visible vapor cloud, the crew is to egress the area immediately and report the situation to the Fire Department.  In the event a crew member is incapacitated and cannot be rescued without an SCBA, the Fire Department will effect a rescue.  If a cylinder fails and expells all of its product the Fire Department and Emergency Management personnel will institute evacuation procedures of residences and/or schools should they become endangered.  The facility is equipped with automatic alarms, siren"

The WWTP is surrounded by dikes which will minimize harm to surrounding areas.  There is a 75 X 75 X 10 Yd. storm water basin 100 yds. South East of the chemical storage site that will contain a large portion of any release. \n    The implementation of this program has identified some  weak areas in our chemical safety program at the WWTP.  More intensive chemical safety training with plant personnel, fire Department / Emergency Response Coordinators and Emergency Medical Services is in order.  Our chemical supplier offers training seminars and we will be scheduling training for all plant personnel and emergency response entities."
