      "SummaryText": "The Georgia Gulf - Oklahoma City Plant has a long history of safe operation in the Oklahoma City community.  Our employees work hard every day to provide a safe work place and protect the environment both inside and outside of our fences.\n\nPlant Information\n\nThe Oklahoma City Plant produces Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) resin.  Although there are many different uses for PVC, the Oklahoma City Plant product is used primarily by the vinyl siding and PVC pipe markets.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Plant produces PVC resin by polymerizing vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  After the polymerization step is complete, the resin is dried and stored for shipping to our customers.  Most of the vinyl chloride monomer that we consume is shipped to us by rail from the Georgia Gulf vinyl chloride plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  Vinyl chloride monomer is gas at normal conditions, but is kept under pressure and handled as a liquid much the same way that propane gas is handled.  At certain concentrations, VCM is flammable and we have many safety systems in place to deal with this hazard.\n\nAccident History\n\nNo incidents have occurred at the Oklahoma City Plant requiring reporting under the EPA Risk Management Plan.\n\nAccident Prevention\n\nAccident prevention is a large part of every job at the Oklahoma City Plant.  We work hard to make sure that our systems, procedures and people are all working together to prevent accidents from occurring.  To ensure safe operations of our plant, we have many systems in place including:\n\n\u00b7 Two independent gas detection systems (air monitors)\n\u00b7 Routine program audits for improvement\n\u00b7 Relief valves for relieving excess pressure\n\u00b7 Tank containment systems\n\u00b7 Computer process control systems\n\u00b7 Equipment corrosion monitoring programs\n\u00b7 Formal Equipment Inspection Programs\n\u00b7 Automatic heat detector shut down system\n\u00b7 Automatic (fail closed) isolation valve systems \n\u00b7 Formal incident reporting and investigation system\n\u00b7 Vibration Monitoring to predict equipment life and plan"

Our emergency preparedness efforts focus on four key areas:\n\nPersonnel \u00bf The Oklahoma City Plant is protected by a 12-member volunteer emergency Response Team (ERT) comprised of employees from various plant departments.  The ERT provides fire suppression, confined space/industrial rescue, emergency medical, and hazardous materials response services.  In addition to on-site training, outside courses are an integral part of team training. Members attend Emergency Medical Training at Oklahoma City Community College and Fire/Rescue Training at Refinery Terminal Fire Company in Corpus Christi, TX. \n\nResources - Fixed emergency equipment at the Oklahoma City Plant includes an emergency siren and pager system to alert responders, two diesel powered emergency generators, one diesel powered emergency air compressor, automatically-activated diesel powered fire pumps, automatic deluge (water spray) systems, automatic sprinkler systems, smoke detector system, two gas detector systems, and an automatic heat detector shut down system.

The plan was developed in coordination with the Oklahoma County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Oklahoma City Fire Department.  \n\nEmergency drills and exercises are a must to ensure member skills are maintained at peak efficiency and equipment and procedures function as expected.  The plant conducts regular drills and exercises to ensure the emergency system undergoes continuous improvement.  \n\nResponse Alliances \u00bf The plant works closely with the Oklahoma City Fire Department, Oklahoma County Local Emergency Planning Committee, Oklahoma County Department of Emergency Management and the Oklahoma City Department of Emergency Management to ensure that sufficient resources will be available during an emergency.  Outside responders have participated in plant pre-planning and familiarization sessions in the event that they are called on to provide assistance.\n\n\nThe Georgia Gulf Oklahoma City Plant is proud of the fact that we have never experienced a hazardous material release resulting in impact on our neighbors.  With our safety systems and employees working every day to prevent chemical accidents, we are confident that this record of safe operation will continue in the future."
