For a 1-ton release of chlorine gas, the distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" is 1.3 miles, affecting approximately 8,323 residents and nearby major commercial areas, the recreational area along the Pearl River, the Ross Barnett Reservoir and the Country Club of Jackson.  The 10,000 gallon ammonia tanks are limited to being filled to 85% of capacity due to the policy of ammonia suppliers used by the City, reducing the effective capacity of each tank to 8,500 gallons.  For an 8,500 gallon release of ammonia gas, the distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" is 2.6 miles, affecting approximately 29,879 residents and nearby schools, major commercial areas, the recreational area along the Pearl River, the Ross Barnett Reservoir, the Natchez Trace Parkway and the Country Club of Jackson.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs recommended by the \"RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants,\" a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second and D atmospheric stability class were used.  Gas was assumed to be released through a 1\" diameter break in the supply piping.  Failure of the system to automatically close valving at each cylinder was assumed.  The release scenario for chlorine storage assumed the release of all 12 one-ton cylinders connected together, producing a distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" of 0.2 miles, affecting approximately 20 residents and the recreational area of The Country Club of Jackson.  The release scenario for ammonia storage assumed the release of the contents of one of the storage tanks (effectively 8,500 gallons), producing a distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" of 0.3 miles, affecting approximately 55 residents and the recreational area of The Country Club of Jackson.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe plant is manned 24 hours each day including holidays with at least two operators.  These operators inspect the chlorine and amm"

The chlorine system has area gas monitors which trigger flashing lights and an audible alarm on the main plant computer in the Operations Room.  The ammonia system has an area gas monitor in the Ammoniator Room which triggers a flashing light and an audible alarm in the building.  The ammonia system also has high and low pressure alarms which produce an audible alarm on the plant computer.  Maintenance personnel are immediately called in to stop small releases.  The operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia equipment are performed in accordance with manufacturer\u00bfs instructions.  Operations and maintenance personnel receive regular training in the use and maintenance of the equipment through monthly safety meetings, seminars provided by the equipment manufacturers and formal classes provided through the Mississippi Water and Pollution Control Operators Association and other training providers.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years, the plant has not had any releases of chlorine of ammonia which resulted in death, injury, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant has developed an emergency response program.  Once it is determined that a situation is larger than what can be handled by Plant personnel, the situation will be reported to the 911 emergency dispatcher, who will then contact the appropriate emergency response agency, such as the Jackson and Ridgeland Fire Departments, the Jackson and Ridgeland Police Departments and the Hinds County and Madison County Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs).  Though discussions during monthly safety meetings, through formal training and through quarterly emergency drills, plant operations and maintenance personnel will be properly trained in limited emergency response.  As the situation warrants, the public will be notified through respective Public Affairs personnel at the Police, Fire"

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe City of Jackson is dedicated to the proper use of chemicals in a manner which is safe to the environment and people.  Chemical storage areas and process equipment are regularly inspected, repaired and upgraded to prevent accidental releases.  Should an accidental release occur, response activities will be coordinated through the Hinds County Emergency Operations Center and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.  On-site personnel are trained to make minor repairs and to contain small accidental releases.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant withdraws water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir, treats the water and supplies the water to a portion of the City of Jackson.  The plant uses chlorine gas mixed in water with anhydrous ammonia gas to disinfect the water.  The chlorine gas is stored in 10 one-ton cylinders.  At a given time, 5 of the cylinders are connected together on a single header.  The ammonia gas is stored in two 10,000 gallon above ground tanks.\r\n\r\nCoordinates for the chemical storage locations at the plants were computed using EPA's online EnviroMapper tool.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nEPA mandates that the Worst Case Release Scenarios have a release of the entire contents of the largest single container of each regulated substance during a 10-minute period with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an F atmospheric stability class.  \"Toxic Endpoint\" distances for releases were developed using tables listed in EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\"  Population affected by releases was computed using the EPA / NOAA Marplot 4.2 software which contains the year 2010 census data.  EPA requires that a circle with a radius equal to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" be used to determine the area adversely affected by a release.  EPA does not allow the circle to be modified to compensate for prevailing wind co"
