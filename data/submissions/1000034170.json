Facility accidential release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Feed Energy are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is storage. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used to nuetralize the water before it is sent to the treatment plant after the manufacturing of liquid feed.
