Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n     Driscoll Strawberry Associates, Inc. currently has in place the following policies and procedures \n     designed and implemented to minimize the risk of an accidental release of ammonia and to describe   \n     the proper response to an emergency situation.\n       1.

Daily Compressor Log Sheet\n.  .\nB. General Facility Information\n  1. FACILITY LOCATION\n      The Driscoll Strawberry refrigeration facility is located near the Community of Aromas, on the coast\n      of central California, near the northwestern border of Monterey County, on 31.32 acres of property.\n      The  facility is located at 1750 San Juan Road.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is all\n      agricultural land, and is bordered on the northwest side by the Southern Pacific Railroad.\n      Driscoll Strawberry Associates, Inc. has been growing, cooling and storing strawberries on this\n      location for the last  27 years.  The current Driscoll Strawberry facility was built in the late 1960's, and\n      has been using ammonia refrigeration since that time.\n      The new construction project consists of  a 60,000 sq. ft.  pre-cooling and cold storage warehouse\n      with a dedicated ammonia refrigeration system.  The new construction is located adjacent to, and just\n      south of, the previously existing Driscoll Cold Storage warehouse and office complex.  The proposed\n      new AHM equipment will be installed on the west side of the new building.  The new equipment\n      consists of 11 room cooling evaporators, 14 pre-cooling u"

All of which will be permanently installed at this facility and totally \n      independent from the previously existing buildings and equipment.\n     The total quantity of ammonia to be used in the refrigeration system will be approximately 9,300 lbs.  \n     The piping and instrumentation diagram for the refrigeration process is shown in the Appendix.  The \n     AHM used in this system is anhydrous ammonia, and it is used as the primary refrigerant in a closed-\n     loop system.  Therefore, the containment of the ammonia within the piping/equipment system is the key \n     to eliminating accidental releases.  \n 2. PREVENTION OF SYSTEM OVERCHARGING\n     See Operating Procedures Section VI.D.1.C. \n 3. UTILITY SYSTEM\n     The facility has an emergency power system to respond to possible power failures.  The failure of \n     such a system to operate in an emergency poses no risk of an ammonia release since loss of power \n     simply stops the flow of ammonia, however electrically operated pumps, etc., may be affected.\n     In the event of a post-earthquake fire at the site, firewater is drawn from the facility's on-site well and \n     reservoir system.  The post-earthquake functionality of the facility's firewater system thus depends on \n     the vulnerability of the system to earthquake-induced failure, which is unknown.\n\nC. Release Scenarios\n     The worst case release scenario to be considered is as specified in 2750.3.C.1) which is 100% of the \n     system charge released in 10 minutes.  The analytical results of this scenario are found in Section 4, \n     however, it is highly unlikely that a release of this magnitude could ever be realized due to the physical \n     characteristics of ammonia.\n     The alternate release scenario chosen concerns a ruptured 4\" liquid ammonia pipeline.  This scenario is \n     possible during an earthquake and has the most serious impact of the tr"
