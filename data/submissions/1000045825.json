      "SummaryText": "Alabama Power Company's J.H. Miller Electric Generating Plant (Plant Miller) is located near Porter, Alabama, and consists of four (4) steam electric generating units.\r\n\r\nPlant Miller has two (2) hyperbolic cooling towers that provide closed cycle cooling water to each of the plant's 4 operating units.  The plant utilizes 1 ton cylinders of chlorine to provide bacteria/algae protection for each tower. A one ton cylinder is attached to a manifold at each cooling tower for this purpose.  Additional cylinders are kept as spares in each location.  The total quantity of chlorine on-site exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 lbs. The hazard that would be associated with the chlorine at Plant Miller is a toxic hazard.  The most likely event is a leak in the manifold attached to the cylinder.  The cylinders are protected from traffic around the plant by open-sided steel framed sheds.  When it is necessary to replace empty cylinders, trained personnel remove and connect full cylinders to the manifold.  In performing this task on March 10, 2015, a small amount of chlorine was released.  The release occurred while an employee was attempting change out a chlorine cylinder. In disconnecting the cylinder, the employee closed the valve on the cylinder and began to disconnect the flexible tubing pigtail from the cylinder.   In doing so, the employee failed to fully seat the chlorine isolation valve which isolates the chlorine feed line from the cylinder. Once the employee began to disconnect the flexible tubing from the cylinder, the chlorine that remained in the flexible tubing pigtail escaped.   Corrective action was taken to stop the leak and to retrain employees on proper line break procedures as it relates to  exchange of chlorine cylinders. As a result of the event, one employee received medical treatment beyond first aid.  \r\n \r\nPlant Miller also has a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system at each of the 4 units to control the emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from b"

      "SummaryText": "are conducted including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.  \r\n\r\nPlant Miller is included in the Birmingham/Jefferson County LEPC emergency response plan.  In addition, the plant has in place an emergency action plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia or chlorine.  The procedures cover the following: evacuation plan, recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities and documenting releases; emergency alarm systems; training; and pre-emergency coordination with the Jefferson County LEPC."

      "SummaryText": "urning coal to produce electricity. As part of the system, vaporous ammonia is injected into the flue gas and aids in the chemical reaction to convert NOx to harmless nitrogen and water vapor.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks on the plant site for use in the SCR system.  The total quantity of ammonia on-site exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 lbs. The main hazard that would be associated with anhydrous ammonia at Plant Miller is a toxic hazard. EPA's RMP COMP model was used to determine the worst case scenario for the release of the entire contents from a storage tank of anhydrous ammonia. The storage tanks are protected from traffic around the plant by bollards installed around the tanks. Trained plant operations personnel conduct the unloading of anhydrous ammonia from the rail cars into the storage tanks. Therefore, a rupture that would result in the rapid release of the gas is unlikely.\r\n\r\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) program under OSHA is in effect for Plant Miller, therefore Program 3 applies.  \r\n\r\nPlant Miller has established environmental, health and safety programs designed to ensure that a safe working environment is maintained for all employees.  The accidental release prevention program at Plant Miller is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system and the use of chlorine used on the two cooling towers.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include: accessibility, ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing standard operating and preventive maintenance procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and ensuring periodic compliance audits and incident investigations"
