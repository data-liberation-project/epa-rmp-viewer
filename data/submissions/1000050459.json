This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass processing corn to manufacture food grade and industrial starch.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This is propylene oxide.  Propylene Oxide is used as a reactant to modify food grade starches.  \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nIngredion Incorporated maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazard, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes. We are in the process of converting to the GHS system and our entire corporation is going to a single information system with each plant having its own electronic tab.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and efficiently controlled.   The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a Hazards Operability Study (HAZOPS).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in safety engineering process chemistry and process operations and are re"

This system will require retraining of employees.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ingredion Incorporated.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nIngredion Incorporated conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. All corrective actions are tracked in our EXP database.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIngredion Incorporated promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for the life of the process. Reports are electronically stored in\n\nthe EXP data and are reviewed by a corporate process.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIngredion Incorporated believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out."
