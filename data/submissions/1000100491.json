A number of programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and identify opportunities for improvement.  The Oyster Creek Plant maintains a structured safety process, as well as employee safety teams that meet regularly.\r\n\r\nThe Plant has not identified any changes to safety practices necessary to achieve or maintain compliance with any applicable regulatory standard since our last submission.  However, as part of our efforts to continually improve safety at the Plant, Braskem is currently training site personnel on Human Reliability to increase focus on higher risk tasks and effective problem-solving across all work groups."
