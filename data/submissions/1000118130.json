This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since the end of 1989. The manager is Jerrid Nickols and the operations supervisor is Patrick Seymoure. Site management names and emergency contact information are posted on a sign at the facility entrance.\nThe facility occupies approximately 60 acres and is situated two miles south of the intersection of State Route 218 and US35, on the southern edge of the town of Walton. The town of Walton is located north of the facility.\nWalton manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer 11-37-0 and 9-30-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid, and water, in a controlled environment. While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume. Production\nrates average 40,000 tons of polyphosphate fertilizer per year. Walton also produces a fertilizer solution called aqua ammonia, which is made by combining water and anhydrous ammonia.\nOne of the RMP-regulated materials involved in this fertilizer manufacturing process is anhydrous ammonia. Three 30,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, these tanks can hold 76,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia. This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure. It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\nThe other RMP-regulated material at this facility is aqua ammonia. The facility manufactures aqua ammonia for resale to the farmers. Aqua ammonia is a solution containing anhydrous ammonia and water. Three 30,000-gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of the aqua ammonia greater than 20%"

      "SummaryText": "ammonia.\nAnhydrous and aqua ammonia are not poisons, but they are an inhalation / respiratory hazard. Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body. However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular. Anhydrous and aqua ammonia are non-flammable gases. Anhydrous ammonia has a\nstrong chemical affinity for water and, therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia and propane emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck or railcar) to the bulk storage tanks. Flexible hoses must be connected properly. Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed. All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system or loading stations occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room. Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow.\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely. The bulk storage tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code. The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers. All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input. The passive mitigation systems in place at the Walton facility are:\n- Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n- Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tanks.

      "SummaryText": "to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the steel structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point. At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank\nfrom emptying to the atmosphere.\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function. The active mitigation systems in place at the Walton facility are:\n- Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks. They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate. They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat. Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n- Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only. This prevents anhydrous ammonia or propane from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\n- Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great. They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n- An emergency shutoff cord, located along the unloading station shuts the plumbing off. There are also four remotely located electrically controlled pneumatic valves that can be activated to shut off all the outlet valves of the storage tanks - An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and an adjacent water well at each unloading point.\n- Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n-"

All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season. A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia. All hose replacements are documented in the maintenance files. Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\nThis facility uses a certified contractor for all certified welding and construction performed on the tank. The Walton processing plant undergoes a complete ammonia inspection by a third party at least every five years.

The audits consist of five major topical areas: Safety & Health, Environmental, Fire\nProtection & Security, Administrative and Housekeeping & Storage. Issues are documented in a report and sent to the facility manager and upper management. Updates on action item status must be made regularly.\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been made at the Walton facility, as part of their Process Safety Management Program.\nThe analysis will be updated every five years, or as changes in the process are made. PHA's are performed using the HAZOP technique and analyze all aspects involved in the production of 10-34-0 fertilizer. The evaluation team includes representatives from the corporate Safety Department, group Management and Operations employees.\nEach situation is discussed, and possible causes are listed. Unless otherwise noted, situations are evaluated under the assumption that safety controls are in effect. Potential consequences are listed and given a rating of 1 - 4 for severity and likelihood; with \"1\" being the worst case and \"4\" being \"none or very low\". When plotted, a risk value is assigned from A - D; with \"A\" being the worst and most critical item and \"D\" being of least consequence.\nFormal investigations are performed for all environmental or safety incidents. Documentation is kept on file at the facility and the corporate Safety Department.\nA formal Management of Change (MOC) system is administered by the Safety Department. An electronic MOC form is filled out whenever a change is made to the ammonia system. Forms are routed from the facility operator to the Engineering and Safety Departments for review and remarks. Completed MOC documents are stored in a Lotus Notes database.\nMonthly Safety Committee meetings allow employees to discuss any concerns they may have with the operation of the facility.\nIssues are documented and assigned to employees for follow-up. Records of all meetings are kept at the facility.\nThe Walton facility"

Operators and management, together with representatives from the Safety and Engineering Departments spend the day discussing any and all issues related to the production of 11-37-0, 9-30-0 and aqua ammonia.\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\nIn the event of a burst hose or defective valve, employees are instructed to shut down the conversion process and, if possible, approach the shutoff valve from upwind and attempt to turn it off.\nFor an uncontainable release, employees will immediately call the police and fire department or other first responders, as appropriate. All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated to an upwind location. Once the response team has arrived, we will work in concert with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak. In the meantime, a steady\nspray of water will deluge the ammonia gas plume and knock it to the ground, while chemically binding any free ammonia.\nThe employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order: the facility Manager, 911, the corporate Safety Department emergency phone number, the Indiana Emergency Response hotline and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management emergency phone number. All applicable contact names and numbers are found in the facility spill and emergency response plan.\nCommunication procedures with responders\nThe local fire department is invited to tour the Walton facility on an annual basis. Facility management, employees and fire department personnel have jointly discussed the location of the anhydrous ammonia and response procedures on a regular basis. They know the location of all emergency shutoff valves and on-site response equipment.\nThe LEPC and state regulatory agencies receive a copy of our hazardous materials storage information, every February, i"

A copy of the Walton Emergency Action Plan is on file with the LEPC and the local fire departments.\nSecurity Plans\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) 49 CFR Part 172, requires all facilities that offer or transport hazardous materials to document a security plan and perform employee awareness training. A security assessment plan has been created to describe all security measures at this facility, identify any vulnerable areas and then document the measures taken to address those risks. The plan is intended to work in conjunction with the Emergency Action and Spill Control Plan to meet all required criteria. All potential employee candidates are interviewed prior to hiring. Candidates with a CDL receive additional previous employment verification and a record is kept in their Driver's Qualification file. References may be verified depending n the level of familiarity with the person.\nThere is a fence around the entire perimeter of the facility. There is a security system for the office and chemical buildings.\nThis includes fire protection. Each employee has his own code for arming and disarming the system. Management controls employee access. A report is available to detail all access activity. All buildings and vehicles are secured during non-business hours.\nPackaged and bulk insecticides are stored in the chemical building at the north end of the facility. Inventory is closely monitored and access to visitors is restricted unless accompanied by Anderson personnel.\nThere are three bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tanks at the southeast end of the property. Valves are locked when not in use. Anhydrous ammonia is received via railcar or tank truck. Several railcars may be staged on the tracks at one time. The anhydrous ammonia tanks are visually inspected daily.\nPhosphoric acid is transported to the facility by railcar and staged at the tracks until produc"
