It is the intent of the Columbus West Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA #58-2011 Edition) into this process.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Columbus Fire Department as well as the Franklin County Emergency Management.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Medical Services (Columbus Fire Department EMS Division) and Mount Carmel West Hospital.\n\nSunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals, LP - Columbus West Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one (1) 60,000 gallon (water capacity) butane storage vessel.\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (potential for off-site impacts) release scenario is a BLEVE accident and associated fireball.\n\nSunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals, LP - Columbus West Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with fire department and the Franklin County Emergency Management.  The Columbus Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training sessions for this system.\n\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (thermal protection) pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals, LP looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Columbus Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.  Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
