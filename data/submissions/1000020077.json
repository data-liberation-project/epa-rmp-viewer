This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Continental Facility located at 12794 Road 92, Latty, OH 45855.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Continental Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Continental Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nThis RMP includes one covered process: (1) on-site Tank Storage and Filling.  This process will be managed in accordance with the requirements of a Program Level 2.  Helena is resubmitting this RMP as a 5-Year update.  As part of the update, Helena updated the off-site consequence analysis for the worst case and the alternative case release scenarios for each covered process.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Continental Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is currently transported to the Facility via an 8,500-gallon tanker truck and then transferred into the on-site 30,000-gallon storage tank.  The Vendor (i.e. tanker truck operator) is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation.  \n\nFrom the storage tank, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and sold as retail to the end user.  The on-site tank storage and filling process is performed by qualified and trained Facility personnel.  Facility personnel conduct the storage and filling procedures in accordance with its Operating Procedures.  \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case"

      "SummaryText": " and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for Tank Storage and Filling covered process.  The worst case scenario release for the Continental Facility assumes that all the contents of the largest single vessel (a single 30,000-gallon storage tank) are released.  The release was modeled as if the storage tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for the Storage and Filling covered process assumes that the 2-inch liquid transfer pipe is breached during the filling process.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The ammonia storage prevention program is implemented by Helena employees.  Helena employees inspect the markings on the Tanker Truck to ensure that the container is operated within the U.S. DOT inspection requirements and they inspect the Bill of Lading to ensure that the containers are not overfilled.  Helena employees also conduct inspections of the tanker truck and its on-site storage tank for leaking valves and fittings in accordance with the accident program detailed in the Risk Management Program document.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena's Continental Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.  Helena has a written Contingency Plan that includes procedures to notify local emergency response agencies in event of a significant ammonia release.  Helena employees will not, under any circumstance, serve as first responders to a significant release of ammonia.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or s"
