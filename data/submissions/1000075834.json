The program is designed to inform all Plant employees of the hazards of chlorine, procedures for the safe use of chlorine, and the steps taken for the safety of employees in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, training, etc.).\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Skaneateles Water Treatment Plant (Plant) is located at 20 West Genesee Street in the Village of Skaneateles, Onondaga County, New York. The facility stores and uses chlorine in the treatment process of potable water and is situated in in an area zoned as Downtown D, adjacent to an areas zoned as Residential A-2. The Plant is located across one parcel comprising a total of 0.76 acres of land. The Plant was originally built in 1894 and is currently owned and operated by the City of Syracuse Water Quality Management Division.\r\n\r\nThe drinking water treatment system at the Plant consists a number of one-ton containers of chlorine and two (primary and backup) chlorine feed systems for the disinfection of water. Chlorine gas is transported via vacuum piping to the Main Operations facility. At the Main Operations facility, the chlorine gas is metered into an injector and mixed with potable water supplied from the Village of Skaneateles. The chlorine solution is injected at two feed points in the water intake and manhole than sent to the distribution system. The system consists of redundant storage, transport and feed equipment.\r\n\r\nThe Plant"

The Plant is registered to Program Level 3 under the CAPP program.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe Plant has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the chlorine onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively). All Plant employees receive operator training, safe work practices training and training on the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Safety meetings are conducted to further protect employees and the community as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe Plant's prevention program is designed to inform all employees of the hazards of chlorine, procedures for the safe use of chlorine, and the steps taken for the safety of employees and the community in the event of a release or spill.\r\n\r\nThe Plant endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to employees and the community by having procedures in place to provide employees educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job. In addition to the ongoing inspection and maintenance of the drinking water treatment system, wherever possible system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).

Alarms are placed throughout the Plant to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of chlorine or other emergencies that may be encountered. The Plant has developed specific procedures to be followed in the event of release. These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so. Plant personnel are on site 24 hours, 7 days per week.                                              \r\n\r\nPlant employees have coordinated the Plant's emergency response program with the Village of Skaneateles' Fire Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Plant recognizes that the implementation of this program is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring and improving anhydrous chlorine handling operation at the Plant. As such, the prevention program will evolve as the Plant continues its ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for the employees and the surrounding community."

Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and employees alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of chlorine into locations that could expose employees and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\r\n\r\nThe Plant has incorporated many safety features in the design of the drinking water treatment system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The Plant's drinking water treatment system is operated under vacuum and is continuously monitored by automated control systems. Further, one-ton containers are equipped with pressure relief valves (fusible plugs) on all one-ton containers and chlorine detectors are employed to detect any releases.\r\n\r\nThe Plant considers the health and safety of each employee as its most important responsibility. It is our policy to provide a healthy and safe work environment.
