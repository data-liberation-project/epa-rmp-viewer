However, as a worst case scenario, the spill of pesticide will be corrected as follows:\n\n\n\n1.    Control the spill at its source\n\n2.    Contain the spill to prevent from spreading or contaminating soil from entering sewage and drainage systems or any body of water\n\n3.

Pick up wash liquid with additional absorbent and place into compatible disposal container\n\n6.    Once all material is cleaned up and placed in a disposal container, arrange for disposal.\n\n\n\nFor spills related to gasoline and/or diesel fuel, a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan is in place.\n\n\n\nTraining for pesticide safety and Worker Protection Standard will be done on an annual basis for all employees with potential exposure to chemical hazards.\n\n\n\nEmployees who mix and apply chemicals are monitored an on a daily basis with occasional observations by department supervisor and/or manager.\n\n\n\n    -  Accidental release:  During the past 5 years, Kauai Coffee has not had an accident involving an accidental release.\n\n\n\n List locations of pesticides on this site:\n\n1.
