Their express purpose is to supply the people of Southeast Asia with much needed protein.  There is a strong demand for small fowl to make the cuisines which are part of the cultures in these countries.\n\n\n\nThe Cedar River Poultry management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Cedar River Poultry's safety and environmental policies are administered by the General Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at 901 North Main Street in Charles City, Iowa was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the International Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles a maximum of 15,000 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for blast freezing operations and cooler/freezer storage. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are located outside the Engine Room, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PR"

      "SummaryText": "OGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Cedar River Poultry to prevent the accidental release of ammonia at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that the Cedar River Poultry employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not ov"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators of an ammonia leak.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (November 2006 - November 2011). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Cedar River Poultry facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) has been developed by Cedar River Poultry and is included in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nThe Cedar River Poultry facility is non-responding, and the facility plans to coord"

The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Cedar River Poultry facility is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2.
