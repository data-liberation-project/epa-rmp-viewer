(Midcoast) is committed to the same level of safety and environmental excellence that all other Midcoast assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them.  As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Facility complete a thorough training program, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\r\n\r\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) includes specific instructions for employees and contract personnel to follow in the event of an accidental release.  Activation of this plan will place in motion a series of events specifically designed to minimize the impact of the release on our employees, surrounding community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Facility is located northeast of Oakwood, Texas in Freestone County. The Facility is a natural gas liquid (NGL) storage and transfer facility. NGL is stored at the site prior to sending the NGL to a sales pipeline. The Facility currently consists of six (6) 30,000-gallon pressurized storage tanks, two (2) unloading stations, and piping components.  Trucks unloading NGL will also be located at the Facility and may be full of NGL while on site but not stored at the Facil"

If a loaded truck is on site, then the tanks will not be at capacity. As such, the total amount of regulated substance stored on site cannot be more than the total capacity of the on-site tanks.  The Facility is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\r\n \r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about our operations at the Facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our five (5) year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the Accident Prevention Program in place at the Facility.  Because the processes at the plant are regulated by the EPA's RMP and are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program are important steps toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  The Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.

Process safety information is useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  The Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and \"What-If/Checklist\" method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors:  The Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):  The Facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that"

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:  The Facility has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices:  The Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Facility periodically conducts audits to determine whether procedures and practices required by the Accident Prevention Program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's finding are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two (2) most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo accident resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred at the Facility wi"
