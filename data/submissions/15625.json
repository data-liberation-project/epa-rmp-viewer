(TransCanada) Riverside Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The TransCanada policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nTransCanada owns and operates the Riverside Plant located in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. The Riverside Plant is a natural gas liquids fractionation plant capable of processing raw make which is the main feed.  The plant separates ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane and natural gasoline from the main feed through a series of distillation columns.  Natural gas is separated from the feed prior to fractionation.\n\nThe Riverside Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, TransCanada identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Riverside Plant are natural gasoline, propane, isobutane, n-butane, raw make, used oil and heating oil.  However, TransCanada has determined that used oil and heating oil have an National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 1 and natural gasoline has an NFPA flammability hazard rating of 3, which exempts these mixtures from threshold determination.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Riverside Plant is"

Therefore, the Riverside Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  Isobutane is the worst-case flammable release with a 1.02-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for n-butane as follows.  A 3-inch pipe on the truck rack is sheared during loading, causing the entire contents to empty from the truck.  The n-butane will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for n-butane.  The alternative-case release of n-butane resulted in a 0.27-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint and less than 0.06 mile distance to the LFL endpoint.  \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Riverside Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the Riverside Plant.

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Riverside Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include a Health Safety & Environmental Team (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, Behavioral Based Safety Programs and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Riverside Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conducts all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Riverside Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  Theses procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.

To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures the Riverside Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Riverside Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during there work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4)"
