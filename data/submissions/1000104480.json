Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability,\r\nammonia is considered a hazardous material. Freshpet is committed to maintaining a safe pet food manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system\r\nobeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68). Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems. Our RMP program includes elements addressing:\r\n\r\n-\tEmployee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program\r\n-\tProcess Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so that our employees are fully informed\r\n-\tProcess Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards\r\n-\tOperating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment\r\n-\tMechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring\r\n-\tTraining: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system\r\n-\tManagement of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits\r\n-\tPre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly\r\n-\tContractors: We carefu"
