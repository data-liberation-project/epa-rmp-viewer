LPI maintains all of the equipment in its process by employing the best engineering practices in the industry.  LPI strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\nMeeting environmental regulations is part of LPI's policies and by developing and maintaining this Risk Management Program, LPI is complying with the Federal Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68).  LPI is committed to the accidental release prevention program.\n\nLPI maintains a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designed specifically for an ammonia release for the Ammonia Process.  The plan will be reviewed with response organizations and others.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b)\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe LPI Ammonia Process produces a fertilizer solution by blending water, anhydrous ammonia, acetic acid, and a variety of heavy metals in two low pressure mix tanks.  The primary function of the anhydrous ammonia is to raise the pH of the fertilizer solution.\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 30,000 gallon (150,000 pound) pressure vessel under ambient temperature.  The pressure vessel has a maximum fill level of 85% resulting in a maximum storage capacity of 25,000 gallons or 125,000 pounds.   The pressure vessel is protected by an 8' cyclone fence that has a padlock for security.  The vessel has a flash valve that prohibits a ruptured line or valve from emptying the vessel.\n\nApproximately 200 feet of 2 service line connected the pressure vessel to the process building.

In LPI's case, anhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance.  Modeling of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia are required for offsite consequence analysis under Program 3.\n\nEPA defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The largest quantity should be determined taking into account administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored or processed in a vessel or pipe at any one time, or alternatively, procedures that occasionally allow the vessel or pipe to store larger than usual quantities.\nEndpoint concentration for ammonia release was established by EPA to be 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm by mass (40 CFR Part 68, Appendix A).\n\nEPA defines the alternative release scenario to be any release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite.\nThe movement and dispersion of a regulated substance that is accidentally released to the atmosphere can be predicted by using EPA lookup tables tabulated in an EPA publication titled Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, April 1999 (OCGA) or by using computer models.\n\nThe EPA lookup table method is straight forward and therefore is expected to be more conservative.

Computer models, on the other hand, accounts for many site-specific factors will yield a less conservative estimate of offsite consequence than the EPA lookup tables.\n\nA computer model named ALOHA (Area Locations of Hazardous Atmosphere) Version 5.4 (released in 2007) was used to predict the footprints of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario at the LPI facility.  The ALOHA computer model predicts the dispersion of anhydrous ammonia downwind from the release source, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of the anhydrous ammonia, the physical characteristics of the site, weather conditions, and the circumstance of the release.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the LPI Ammonia Process for is the loss of 125,000 pounds of pressurized anhydrous ammonia representing a complete failure of the pressure vessel.  The entire content of the pressure vessel is released to the atmosphere within 10 minutes resulting in a release rate of 12,500 lbs/min.  Modeling results show that the worst-case scenario would have an offsite toxic endpoint of 2.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the LPI Ammonia Process for is the release of 125,000 pounds of pressurized anhydrous ammonia resulting from a failed connection on the pressure vessel.  The entire content of the pressure vessel is released to the atmosphere in 60 minutes resulting in a release rate of 2,083 lbs/min.
