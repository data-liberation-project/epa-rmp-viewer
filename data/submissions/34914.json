The maximum amount  unloaded or present at our facility at any one time would be 53,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWe have implemented and have posted at our anhydrous plant our emergency response guidelines for handling of anhydrous ammonia. These guidelines include response in case of fire, spills or leaks, and first aid. Employees have been trained in regards to all of these emergencies. Ag Service Inc. has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standards. We also have provided the Hillsboro Fire Department and the Marion County Emeergency Planning Commission with our community right to know imformation as required by SARA Title III.\n\nSafety is a top priority at our facility.
