These are flammable gases, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and reduce health threats to our workers and the nearby community.  Safety depends on:\n(1) The manner in which we handle these products;\n(2) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility;\n(3) Operating and maintenance procedures; and\n(4) Employee training.\n\nThe President has overall authority for the safety program at the North Branch facility.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to receive and store Liquefied Petroleum Gases (propane, isobutane and normal butane) and then use these materials as propellants in aerosol containers.  These Liquefied Petroleum Gases are the only materials handled at the facility that a subject to the EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the hydrocarbon systems that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n(1) Employee Participation Program\n(2) Process Safety Information\n(3) Process Hazard Analysis\n(4) Operating Procedures\n(5) Training Program\n(6) Contractor Safety Program\n(7) Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n(8) Mechanical Integrity Program\n(9) Hot Work Permit Procedures\n(10) Management of Change Procedures\n(11) Incident Investigation Procedures\n(12) Compliance Audit Procedures\n(13) Trade Secrets Procedures\n(14) Management System\n\n\n4.
