(Arkema) - Crosby, Texas manufacturing facility (Crosby facility) has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) to reduce the risk of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including the following:  \n\n\n\n-Arkema Inc Loss Control Program to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety;\n\n-Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes;\n\n-Hazard Assessment;\n\n-Prevention Program;\n\n-Five-Year Accident History;\n\n-Emergency Response Plan; and\n\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\nARKEMA INC. LOSS CONTROL PROGRAM FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\n\n\nArkema is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers areas such as equipment design and installation, plant operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Crosby plant.  The RMP formalizes and documents these activities.\n\n\n\nThe Crosby facility employs practices, programs, and procedures in place for the prevention, mitigation and/or minimization of catastrophic consequences and releases from materials covered under either standard.  \n\n\n\nThe Crosby facility has One primary operating production unit: MPU.  In addition, the Wastewater Treatment System (WWTS) at the Crosby plant treats the wastewater from the production unit. The CPU Unit is demolished and the BPU unit is officially idled and decommissioned, however there are several tanks and vessels located in the pre-existing CPU Unit that operate in support of the MPU Processing Unit.\n\n\n\nThis commitment to Loss Control starts with AIMS, integrated"

This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Team regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema Inc.'s HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nArkema's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Arkema's commitment to health, environment and safety.  These materials include RMP guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.\n\n\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\n\n\nThe Arkema Crosby facility is located at 18000 Crosby-Eastgate Road in Crosby, Texas.  The facility manufactures liquid organic peroxides, which are primarily used in the production of plastic resins, polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, and fiberglass.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA RMP rule.  Two substances, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and 2-methyl Propene (Isobutylene) are present at, or above, the minimum threshold quantity (TQ) for RMP applicability.\n\n\n\nThe MPU process includes a batch and a continuous process area.  Isobutylene and/or SO2 are used to produce and/or process the majority of the products produced in both the MPU batch and continuous process areas.  Arkema has included all equipment, lines, vessels, storage tanks, and reactors in Building 30 as part of the PSM and RMP covered processes associated with SO2 and Isobutylene related equipment throughout the continuous process structure and batch process structure.  The site evaluated the prevention program for each RMP compound separately.\n\n\n\nThe storage vessels used for the raw mate"

This vessel is a raw material feedstock tank for the MPU batch and continuous processes and stores isobutylene in a pressurized vessel capable of containing the compound.  The vessel is equipped with dual rupture disc and pressure relief valves.  No further emission control is required for these pressure tanks under EPA BACT requirements.  The Sulfur Dioxide feedstock vessel for all processes is located in CPU (17-T-19). \n\n\n\nAdditional specific equipment in Sulfur Dioxide Service:\n\n\n\nEH-14  Evaporator used to vaporize sulfur dioxide that is transferred from 17-T-19 prior to distribution into the MPU Process for active oxygen destruction.\n\n\n\nSpent Acid Treatment Tank (T-37) - The acid mother liquor from CF-1, Separated aqueous acid from T-30 or spent acid, is sent to 30-T-37 to be treated. SO2 is fed from 30-T-19 to 30-T-37 through a vaporizer at a controlled rate to destroy any active oxygen. Sulfur Dioxide emissions are routed to a sodium hydroxide scrubber 30-FS-95.\n\n\n\nSpent Acid Treatment Tank (T-38)- Waste Acid is transferred from the MPU Continuous unit into T-38 at a controlled rate. Sulfur Dioxide is injected at the bottom of the tank at a rate of ~0.2 lb/min to destroy the Active Oxygen in the Waste Stream.

      "SummaryText": "re released during the worst case scenario\n\n\n\nRationale:\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the rational and assessment methodology for each scenario has been revised based on the most current operations, reflecting changes made over the past 5 years, previous plant incidents, and amended process hazard assessment methodologies. The topography in all scenarios is based on a rural area verses an urban area to account for the adjacent farmland and lack of development within one mile of the Arkema Crosby facility.  There was little change in the potentially affected residential population or distance to endpoint for all scenarios versus the previous RMP submission.\n\n\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures in use at the Crosby facility make it very unlikely that either worst-case scenario will occur.  In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Arkema, Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce any potential impacts.\n\n\n\n- Remote shut-off valves on tank piping designed to shutdown flow from the feedstock storage tanks, thereby reducing the amount potentially released;\n\n\n\n- Area monitors that either prompt the control room to activate shutoff of vessel isolation valves and/or actually initiate automatic closing of the isolation valves.\n\n\n\n- Excess flow valves on tank process feed lines from the storage vessels or within the process that shut off the flow of material in the case of  high discharge pressure or loss of material containment. Thus this reduces the amount of material potentially released:\n\n\n\n- Stationary fire monitors which are permanently and strategically placed water cannons with the capability to remove airborne vapor with water sprays or to lay suppressive water deluge from a distance of at least 70 feet from the fire;\n\n\n\n-On-site emergency responders 24 hours per day as well as communications links with additional off-site responders and response equipment;\n\n\n\n-The First Call Interactive Network enabling the facility to immedia"

Current operations dictate that a flange leak or fitting failure demonstrates a more likely alternate case scenario. The site chose to evaluate hose failures for SO2 Unloading or a flange leak on the low-pressure side of the SO2 Feed System, including the Storage Tank and Feed Pump suction piping, and the high-pressure side of the system, including the Feed Pump discharge and the Feed Line.  The breach  in each case was taken to be one-eighth inch diameter. Low-pressure releases were driven by a 40-psig upstream pressure, and high pressure releases were driven by 65-psig upstream pressure. \n\n\n\nIn the flammable alternate cases, two potential impacts are associated with a BLEVE: 1) overpressure shockwave, due to the failure of the vessel wall or 2) a sudden release of the vessel contents, and a fireball, due to ignition of the released flammable vapor. The calculated overpressure impact from a BLEVE of the Isobutylene Storage Tank, extending out to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint specified by the RMP Guidance, is 483 feet, falling within the site boundaries. The BLEVE fireball radiation impact, extending out to the 3.42x106 (watts/m2)4/3-sec thermal radiation dose as specified by the RMP guidance, is 1,053 feet, also approaching the yard of the residence nearest to the site. The site chose to submit the case involving the radiation impact from a BLEVE of the Isobutylene Storage as the required flammable alternate case.\n\n\n\nWhile the alternate release scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur they are subject to the systems within the facility's existing release and accident prevention program.
