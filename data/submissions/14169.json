In fulfilling this commitment, management systems are in place to provide the resources and training to maintain compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, ensuring that safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Accident prevention is emphasized through strict operating procedures, safe work practices, ongoing training and administrative and operational controls. While continually striving to prevent accidental releases, should one occur, the refinery maintains a well-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team for fast response and incident mitigation and control.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tosco Los Angeles Refinery Carson Plant, located in Carson, California, is a petroleum refinery that converts various crude oils into intermediate products. The Carson Plant supplies Tosco's Wilmington Plant with these intermediate streams and they are subsequently used to produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. Other co-products of the refining processing such as coke, sulfur, and carbon dioxide are sold directly from the Carson Plant. The refinery produces and/or uses regulated flammables, including propane, butane, hydrogen and mixtures of regulated flammable substances. Tosco's Carson Plant does not exceed the EPA threshold quantity for any RMP regulated toxic substance.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nTosco's Los Angeles Refinery, Carson Plant has no regulated toxics in quantities that exceed listed federal threshold values, therefore; this Risk Management Plan contai"

      "SummaryText": "ns no analysis of toxic scenarios. \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), resulting from the release of the full inventory of either of two butane storage spheres located in different areas of the plant, and thus potentially impacting different offsite receptors. Controls to prevent and/or mitigate such a release were not considered during this evaluation, therefore; the butane is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite into a vapor cloud explosion. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for these WCSs would include offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a VCE resulting from a release of butane during railcar loading. The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this ARS includes offsite impact in the immediate vicinity of the refinery. \n  \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe Tosco Los Angeles Refinery has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that follows the elements found in the OSHA PSM standard to prevent incidents from occurring. The following is a summary of these elements and a description of the management system that is in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation is regarded as essential to the continuous improvement of the LAR PSM program, and hence in the prevention of accidents. LAR has a written employee participation policy that outlines the many ways in which employees are involved in the accident prevention program, and employees have access to all information generated within the program. All process hazard analysis teams include an experienced unit operator, and employees are also members of teams formed for compliance audits, incident investigations and pre-startup safety reviews.

The typical HAZOP team includes a knowledgeable operator and engineer who systematically analyze detailed process drawings to identify potential hazards. These potential hazards are assigned a risk rank according to specified criteria. The team evaluates accident prevention and mitigation measures already in place and makes recommendations if they believe additional measures are necessary.\n\nFindings of the team are documented and reviewed by management for resolution. Hazards assigned the highest risk rank are given priority, thereby ensuring that each hazard receives the appropriate attention. All approved mitigation measures are tracked to completion. Documentation is retained as to the resolution of all PHA findings.\n\nRevalidation of PHAs are conducted at least every 5 years, or when a major process change is to be implemented, to ensure that process controls do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features. Again, documented findings are forwarded to management to ensure that critical mitigation recommendations are implemented.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nLAR has set forth detailed written procedures with step by step instructions for the various modes of process operations, including startup, normal and temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown and normal shutdown. These procedures are accessible to employees for reference and training and kept evergreen by revisions implemented through the management of change process, periodic review and annual accuracy certification. \n\nTraining\n\nAll employees of LAR that are involved in operating a process are trained in the process and its operating procedures.
