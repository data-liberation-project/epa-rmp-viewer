This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. The goal is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, refinery personnel have been trained on the proper response to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nWoods Cross Operating LLC (the facility) owns three process units within the Woods Cross refinery:  Unit 24 Crude Unit; Unit 25 FCC; and, Unit 26 Poly Unit. These three units are operated by Holly Energy Partners - Operating, L.P.  Both Woods Cross Operating LLC and Holly Energy Partners - Operating, L.P. entities are subsidiaries of Holly Energy Partners, L.P. \n\n\n\nUnit 24 Crude Unit; Unit 25 FCC; and, Unit 26 Poly Unit are EPA RMP covered processes.  Regulated flammable substances used or produced in the facility are included in flammable mixtures that contain pentane, butane, isobutane, isopentane, propane, ethane, ethylene, hydrogen, methane, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, 2-methylpropene, 1,3-butadiene, 2-pentene,(Z)-, and 2-pentene, (E)-. There are not toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity (TQ) in these process units.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE/CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Therefore, there is a management system in place to address each element and to implement the accident prevention program. A brief discussion follows for each of these areas. Employee pa"

Some of the more significant opportunities for active participation are Process Hazard Analysis studies, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Incident Investigation, Operating Procedures and Training.\n\n\n\nDocumentation is an important aspect in the operation of a petroleum refinery and Process Safety Information is maintained for safety and operational reasons. The information regarding chemicals, process chemistry and refinery equipment is extensive and is continuously being verified and updated.\n\n\n\nIdentifying potential hazards is a critical element of the safety process at Woods Cross. Process Hazard Analysis studies have been performed on all covered processes at the refinery and are revalidated or redone on a 5 year schedule. Hazard analysis is also performed on changes through the Management of Change process. Recommendations resulting from the studies are addressed and actions taken to address the recommendations are documented.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures have been developed to provide instructions for safely operating the process units. These procedures serve as a consistent basis for training new operators and for reference by experienced operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed, are considered in the management of change process and are annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nOperator Training is conducted in coordination with the operating procedures. New employees receive foundational training on refinery operations and unit specific training. All operators receive refresher training to ensure operating skills and knowledge are maintained and enhanced. Training requirements are also considered when changes are made to the individual units.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses Contractors to supplement its workforce and because this work is often on or near process equipment, there are specific requireme"

The contractors are made aware of refinery safety rules and evacuation plans and are informed of potential hazards related to their work. Contractor activities are monitored while in the refinery to ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nThe facility reviews process changes through the Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review process. The review and authorization process makes provisions for reviewing the change from several aspects, including the potential hazards, safety and health effects, procedural updates and training requirements. The pre-startup safety review provides a final safety review of the change prior to startup.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity programs are necessary to provide for the on-going integrity of process equipment and instrumentation. Experienced employees and qualified contractors perform maintenance work on the equipment and instrumentation. Inspection and tests are performed in accordance with plant and industry standards and quality assurance is incorporated in new construction and maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations are valuable learning tools in determining facts regarding incidents and in developing corrective actions to prevent recurrence. The refinery has personnel trained in incident investigation techniques and they are assigned as required to form teams, investigate incidents and report on the findings.
