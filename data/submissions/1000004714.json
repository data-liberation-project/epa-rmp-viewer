This Risk Management Plan (RMP) encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the DRWPCC emphasize safety, training, and maintenance.  \n\nThe DRWPCC is located in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, 44 miles west of Philadelphia.  Chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater prior to discharge to the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek.  The facility treats an average flow of 5.2 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater and has the capacity to store approximately 8,000 pounds (lbs) of chlorine on-site at any one time.  Chlorine at the facility is contained in four, 1-ton (2,000 lb) containers that are on a standby/on-line basis to ensure the chlorination process is continuous.  Chlorine is drawn from the 1-ton containers in a gaseous state.\nThe chlorination process area atmosphere is continuously monitored for chlorine gas leaks, and DRWPCC is equipped with visible and audible alarms to alert personnel that a release has occurred.  The DRWPCC preventive maintenance program maintains equipment related to chlorine operations to ensure it is fully operational.\n\nA worst-case release scenario was estimated, per the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance, to provide the greatest distance in any direction to the established toxic endpoint.  The worst-case release quantity, established by the regulations, is the greatest amount of chlorine held in a single vessel.  The worst-case quantity of chlorine at DRWPCC was determined "

In accordance with 40 CFR Section 68.25, it is assumed that the gas is released over a 10-minute period; therefore, the release rate is estimated to be 200 pounds per minute (lbs/min).\n\nNo administrative controls or active mitigation measures were included for the worst-case release scenario.  Tables from the EPA and Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO) Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario, a distance of 1.3 miles.  The facility is considered urban topography due to the buildings, trees, and steep hill to the south, southeast.\n\nThe five-year accident history was evaluated to determine a likely alternative release scenario.  On April 7, 1997, an operator accidentally disconnected the pigtail from a full container.  His respirator was immediately filled with chlorine, and he evacuated the building.  The release was controlled by manually reconnecting the pigtail.  Based on this scenario and a review of common 1-ton releases, it was determined that the most likely scenario for a container leaking would involve the pigtail.  Chlorine gas could potentially be released through the 0.25-inch diameter pigtail, and the container could release approximately 9 pounds per minute of chlorine.  Using EPA Guidance Tables, the distance to the toxic endpoint for this type of release was determined to be 0.1 miles.\n\nThe DRWPCC has developed an accidental release prevention program that includes several key elements.  DRWPCC is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and uses many elements of the PSM in its RMP accidental release prevention program.  The primary safeguard for the chlorine process is the chlorine leak detection system in place at the chlorine building.  The leak detection sensors are tested on a monthly basis to ensure they are fun"

Audible and visible alarms are located at the chlorination building and in the operator control room, and on the roof of the Control and Sludge Disposal Building.\n\nThe DRWPCC has added an additional dual head system to detect chlorine in the regulator pressure vent lines.  A chlorine leak would be indicated by this system with a unique beacon color, differentiating a chlorine release from other DRWPCC emergencies.  The chlorine regulators have pressure relief valves that vent at the rear of the building should the pressure exceed the setpoint.  An interlock device between the alarm and the exhaust fan is in place to shut down the fan when a release is detected, and contain the chlorine inside the chlorine building.\n  \nThe DRWPCC also has several programs in place to prevent accidental chlorine releases.  Specifically, the facility trains operators on the proper operation of the chlorination process, uses state-of-the-art safety equipment, and implements a preventive maintenance program to ensure the process equipment is operating properly.\n\nThe DRWPCC has developed and implemented an Emergency Action Plan and an Emergency Operations Plan, which contain provisions for trained employees to respond to incidental chlorine releases.  However, in the event that the release is beyond the control of the operators, personnel have a mechanism in place to notify the Fire Department for assistance.  Equipment available for handling chlorine leaks at the DRWPCC includes Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and ton container emergency repair Kit `BA? (B Kits). The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) will provide additional support in the event of an emergency response."
