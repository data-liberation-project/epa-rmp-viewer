              "Description": "The NGL Supply Terminal Company, Shelton Terminal facility is located at West 1033, State Route 108 in Shelton, Washington.  This facility provides for the transfer of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) under pressure from stationary (detached from locomotive) pressure tank/rail cars to stationary aboveground storage tanks.  Product is moved to storage tanks using a fixed railcar unloading system via pressure differential, and pumped from storage tanks to transport trucks and trailers using liquid transfer pumps.  A Process Safety Management program has been prepared and implemented at the terminal. This program uses a systematic approach to evaluate the whole process.  Various emergency shutdown and backup lines of defense have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of LPG.  The facility began operation in 2008 and was built with new systems.  Every five years or sooner if warranted, processes will be evaluated and strengthened where required to assure their effectiveness.  NGL Supply Terminal Company has developed standard operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the covered process consistent with the process safety information. Operating procedures for the process will be reviewed by the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team, engineering staff, and operating personnel to ensure that they are accurate and provide practical instructions on how to actually carry out job duties safely. NGL Supply Terminal Company has developed and implemented an emergency action plan to facilitate the prompt response, notification and evacuation of employees due to an unwanted release of LPG.  The site emergency planning and response procedures describe the actions to be taken by all responding personnel to potential emergency situations at the NGL Supply Terminal Company Shelton terminal.",
