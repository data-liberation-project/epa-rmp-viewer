THE FACILITY IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS THE PLANT EACH YEAR AND WE COMPLY WITH THEIR REQUEST FOR FACILITY IMPROVEMENT IF NECESSARY.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR OUR RURAL FACILITY WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 53,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.5 MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 20 AREA RESIDENTS.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED IN SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF A TYPICAL ANHYDROUS AMMONIA PLANT.  EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES AND USE THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS PRESENT DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.  WE INSPECT OUR FACILITY ON A REGULAR BASIS AND MAKE IMPROVEMENTS  WHEN NECESSARY.\n\nTHE EXCELLENT TRAINING RECORD OF OUR COMPANY ALLOWS US TO REPORT THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCURRED AT THIS STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLANS HAVE BEEN SHARED AND DISCUSSED WITH OUR LOCAL RURAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY OR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA."
