      "SummaryText": "Heron Lake BioEnergy, LLC (HLBE) operates a fuel ethanol manufacturing plant.  All included information was reviewed and approved by HLBE management prior to resubmission of this RMP. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nHLBE is committed to worker and public safety and has invested significant resources to prevent accidents.  These resources include personnel training as well as considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nIt is HLBE's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responsders, as necessary.  The facility also maintains: a Health & Safety Plan, a Spill Prevention, Control & Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan and a Facility Response Plan (FRP).\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\n\n\nThe HLBE ethanol plant is located in Heron Lake, Jackson County, Minnesota.  The facility utilizes corn/milo to produce ethanol via natural fermentation to produce fuel grade ethanol for blending with gasoline and other motor fuels.  Co-products produced as a result of ethanol manufacturing include Dried Distiller's Grains with Solubles (DDGS), corn oil and corn syrup.  The substances regulated under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia, Propane, and Natural Gasoline (Flammable Mixture), also known as Denaturant.  Although not used at the facility anymore, the facility currently has approximately 120,000 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia remaining on-site.  When previously utilized, Anhydrous Ammonia was used within the process for ethanol generation, it provided a food soruce for microbes and was also used for pH adjustment.  HLBE has not used Anhydrous Ammonia within the process since February 2012.  At the time of this RMP, the facility is in the process of selling the remaining Anhydrous Ammonia.  Following removal of the Anhydr"

      "SummaryText": "ous Ammonia, the tank will be decommissioned.  Propane is used at the facility to fuel the Loadout Flare and Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO), which is a Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) destruction device.  Denaturant (Natural Gasoline) is used at the facility for blending with ethanol to comply with Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulations to allow final sale of the product.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nAn OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been implemented for Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant at the HLBE facility.  Propane is exempt from the PSM program at the facility, but extensive safety measures are in place to prevent an accidental release.\n\n\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia, Denaturant and Propane tanks are visually inspected daily. All associated equipment, including piping, connections, pumps and secondary containment structures are included in the inspection.  Some of the checks performed during the daily inspection include: check for signs of leakage, corrosion, staining, and odor around all tank bases, valves, test ports, connections, flanges and manways. If an integrity issue is observed or a possible release is determined, it is immediately reported to the facility Supervisor and EH&S Manager. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nHLBE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health & Safety Plan, an SPCC Plan and an FRP.\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  The importance of worker, public, and environmental safety is reflected in HLBE's plans and training activities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe HLBE facility has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction and process safety requirements. HLBE will continue to evaluate and implement changes as "
