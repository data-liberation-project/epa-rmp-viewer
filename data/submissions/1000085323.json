              "Description": "The Village of Monticello water treatment facility, located in Kiamesha Lake, New York utilizes chlorine gas to disinfect the water supply for the Village of Monticello.  The 2.5 MGD capacity treatment plant stores approximately 6,000 lbs. Of chlorine gas in (3) separate 1-ton steel storage cylinders.  The North American Industry Classification System catergorizes the treatment plant as a water supply and irrigation system, with NAICS code 221310; Chlorine gas is regtisterd as CAS No. 7782-50-5, with the Chemical Abstracts Service.\n\n\n\nThe operations of the water treatment plant are relatively safe.  A process hazard analysis of the facility, specifically regarding chlorine gas storage, identified the toxic release of the chlorine gas as the only potential hazard which needs to be addressed in the Program Level 3 RMP.  Three (3) separate storage cylinders, with 2,000 lb. -capacity each are used for chlorine disinfection of the water supply.  These tanks are delivered by a gas distributor and are not filled on site.  Therefore, the potential for release is minimum, due to piping or tubing leaks, breaks and disconnects.  \n\n\n\nUsing the EPA's RMP Comp? Software, the worst-case scenario of chlorine gas release was analyzed.  Assuming the release of the full quantity of gas from one (1) of the storage cylinders, approximately 2,000 lbs, at a release rate of 200 lbs./min for 10 minutes with wind speeds at 1.5 m/sec. in the vicinity of the plant, the the toxic endpoint with concentrations of less than 0.0087mg/L would be a distance of 2.2 miles.  This distance encompasses most of the Village of Monticello, as well the surranding rural communities which have an estimated population of no more than 6,000 residents.  Public facilities in the vicinity include schools, residences, correctional facilities, retail shops, minor commercial business and recreation areas.  There are no significant environmental receptors within the distance to toxic endpoint.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of the toxic release of the chlorine gas, the gas is primarily contained in the chlorine storage room in the main plant building.  This room is kept closed at all times.  It is equipped with a chlorine gas detection system and alarm, manual shut-off valves and a ventilation system.  The storgae room and equipment are checked and maintained on a daily basis by water plant superintendant or other qualified staff.  A spill prevention report and procedures manual is on file at the plant at all times.  The report is reviewed and updated at least on an annual basis.  Employee training is conducted in January of each year for the review of operation, maintenance and safety procedures.  \n\n\n\nThere have been no spills or chemical releases at the Kiamesha Lake water plant in the past 15 years to the knowledge of the current water treatment plant superintendent.  \n\n\n\nThe operation of the plant is subject to compliance with EPA, OSHA and NYSDEC regulations.  The last compliance inspection was performed by the EPA on October 9, 2007.  This inspection found the plant in compliance with the EPA rules and regulations, except for the proper Risk Management Plan filing.  Previously, a Program Level 1 plan was submitted, however, it has been determined that a Program Level 3 plan is required.  In this regard, the following Program Level 3 Risk Management Plan is completed and submitted for review.",

      "SummaryText": "The Village of Monticello Water Treatment Plant, located on Kiamesha Lake in the Town of Thompson, Sullivan County, New York has a current capacity of 2.4 MGD, although average consumption flows range from 1.2 MGD in the winter months to 1.5 MGD in the summer months.  Water is pumped from Kiamesha Lake through a flashmix and flocculation chamber, clarifier tank and a series of gravity sand filters, with filtered water discharged into a large capacity clearwall under the main plant building.  Water flows are disinfected by gas chlorination and conveyed to the village distribution system.\n\n\n\nThree (3) one ton steel chlorine cylinders are located in a room at the northwest corner of the main plant building.  The tanks hold approximately 2,000 lbs. of chlorine gas each, used in accordance with the water disinfection process.  The room is equipped with a chlorine monitor/alarm, a tank and piiping repair kit and Full face respirators located on the entrance door to the storage room to be used in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\n\n\nDue to the potential hazards associated with the potential release of toxic, chorine gas, the storage of approximately 6,000 kbs. Of the substance requires conformance with EPA Risk Management Program Regulations (40 CFR 68) found in 112&reg; of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, OSHA Process Safety Management Standards and NYSDEC Hazardous Bulk Storage Regulations.  The safety procedures and spill prevention measures are outlined in this Program Level 3 Report and a Spill Prevention Report for Handling and Storage of Hazardous Substances at the Village of Monticello Water Treatment Plan and Wellfield, prepared by Glenn L. Smith, P.E., Consulting Engineer."
