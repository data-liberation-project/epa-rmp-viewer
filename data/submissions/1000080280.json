(Radian) to assist in addressing the requirements under the federal Risk Management Program as mandated in the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r )(7).  The Risk Management Program rules requires covered facilities to conduct a hazard assessment, develop a prevention and emergency response program, and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by June 21, 1999.  Sterigenics recently contracted with Ramboll US Corporation (Ramboll) to complete the five-year update of the original RMP plan by means of using the USEPA software, RMP*eSubmit. A copy of the submittal is included in Section 9.0 of this document.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \r\n\r\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\r\n\u00b7 Introduction;\r\n\u00b7 Facility identification and regulated substances;\r\n\u00b7 Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00b7 Hazard Assessment;\r\n\u00b7 Prevention Program;\r\n\u00b7 Five-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00b7 Emergency Response Plan; and\r\n\u00b7 Planned Changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nSterigenics operates a contract sterilization facility located in Atlanta.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under US EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \r\n\r\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\r\nRisk manag"

Sterigenics is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program \r\n\r\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the US EPA Risk Management Program Level 3 requirements (40 CFR 68). The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Process safety information is accessible to employees at all times.\r\n\u00b7 A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparation for RMP compliance.\r\n\u00b7 Computerized process controls prevent unsafe conditions in the sterilizers.\r\n\u00b7 Door interlock system.\r\n\u00b7 Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\r\n\u00b7 Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.\r\n\u00b7 A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.\r\n\u00b7 Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\r\n\u00b7 Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\r\n\u00b7 A thorough Preventative Maintenance program helps ensure equipment is in proper working condition.\r\n\r\nThe sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program at the Sterigenics - Atlanta facility is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide. Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, door interlock system, and explosion-proof electrical systems.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safe"

These scenarios are included within Section 3 (Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequences Analysis). \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\r\n1. The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\n2. The release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n \u00b7 On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\r\n \u00b7 Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nSterigenics - Atlanta has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require that response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).
