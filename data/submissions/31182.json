It is our policy to implement apropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are coordinated with the Albany Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2.  The Stationary Cource and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 82,593 pounds.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are ad"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We will continue our annual plant evacuation and emergency response drills.  In addition, a joint anhydrous ammonia emergency response training drill was conducted with National Frozen Foods Corporation and the Albany Fire Department on .  This drill enhanced our mutual aid capabilities in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at our facility."
