General accidental release and prevention policy of McCain Foods USA, Inc.\n\nIn this food product manufacturing facility we handle anhydrous ammonia in a liquid and vapor state which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during it\u00bfs use to prevent human exposure, reduce the threat to our workers personal health, the surrounding community and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia combined with the safety devices that are incorporated in our facility and the safe handling procedures that our personnel are trained in.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nMcCain Foods USA, Inc., 204 East Roberts Street, Grand Island, Nebraska is responsible for the manufacturing of frozen appetizers.  There are approximately 420 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel.  The plant manufactures product around the clock, (5) five days a week.  McCain Foods is located in an industrial park on the north side of Grand Island, Nebraska.  In addition to our manufacturing facility, the industrial park also houses other manufacturing or business facilities.\n\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the McCain Foods facility is ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it\u00bfs pungent, distinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these levels would not result in any health risks.  \nRisks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat.  The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of exposure.  Ammonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  It will burn, b"

The anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant chemical in the manufacturing/storage process.  The possible hazards that could lead to an accidental release include, but are not limited to , equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  Worst case release scenario and alternate release scenarios including administrative and engineering controls to limit/prevent the release.\n\nWorst case release scenario criteria for McCain Foods USA, Inc. facility:\n\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) located inside the McCain Foods Machine rooms.  These vessels normal operating level is 9,766 pounds of liquid ammonia, approximately 50% of it\u00bfs total capacity.  Although it\u00bfs maximum capacity is 19,536 pounds, this exceeds company policy of only allowing an 80% level at any time.\n\n\tAmmonia Quantity:\t\t\t\t9,766 pounds\n\tRate of Release:\t\t\t\t977 lbs / min.

SRV would be performing exactly as it is designed to do.\n\n\tAmmonia Quantity:\t\t\t\t325 pounds\n\tRate of Release:\t\t\t\t36 pounds/min.
