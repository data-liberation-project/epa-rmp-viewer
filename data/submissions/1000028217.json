PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substanve used as for water disinfection: Chlorine. The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68. The Prevention Program was prepeared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119. \n\n                                                                                                               Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements.

The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy micoorganism that could cause illness in humans. The chlorine is delivered from PRASA's Storage Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  The containers are connected to vacumm chlorinators which the chlorine flows to the injectors.and then the chlorinated water is sent to two (2) different injections points along the process of the plant.\n\n\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined fas indicated in the EPA W"

According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area.                                                             .
