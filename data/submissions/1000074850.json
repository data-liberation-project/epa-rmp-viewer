The same properties that make anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storagr chemical, alsomakes is necessary to observe certain safety percautions in handling anhydrous ammonia.  Overall, the pervention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing gthe threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nerby members of the community is the main goal of  incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy tgo adhere all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner which we handle anhydrous ammonia combinded with safety devices iherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  Our emergency response plan was developed with the assistance of the Enviromental Data Services, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of Wayne Stewart (Maintenance Supervisor) to assess the nature and size release, then the notification of other members of the Batesville Cold Maintenance Personnel & Hazmat Response Teams and the Independence County 911 system which will notify the Batesville Northside Fire Department for assistance with the emergency response.  Memebers of the Batesville Cold Maintenance & Hazmat Response Team Members will determine causes and location of release, isolate release by closing isolation valves to that affected area, and follow the written emergency response plan for proper response to this type of emergency.  With the assistance of Northside Fire Department, the ammonia release vapors will be controlled by the use of water spray from the fire fighting equipment.  The Batesville Northside Fire Department and the Independence County Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affec ted neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted ann"

      "SummaryText": "ouncing systems. The 911 System will also notify Independence County LEPC.  The Primary purpose of this facility is to cool and/or  freeze storage compartments by utilizing anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in storage vessels located on the roof of the maintenance building.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  The systemis a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage Compressor serves the Docks and the copressors for cooling and the Lo Stage Compressor disharge loads.  The Lo Stage serves the blast freezer.  The Single Stage System serves the Holding Freezer.  Other associated systems are the thermosyphon oil cooling for the compressors, liquid feed make up, purge, and condensing system.  Note:  the system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with this description.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at the 3054 East Main location is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia  that can be stored at thsiplant is 25,00 pounds.  This amount is an aggregate found int the storage vessel, as well as the enitre cold storage system.  The worst-case scenario is failure of our largest storage tank when fillied ot the greates amount allowed would release 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the 3054 East Main location.  Passive mitigation was not considered for this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14mg/1 for the worst-case scenario is 2.5 miles.  This location is classified as rural do to the minimal obstructions around the site (generally trees and other vegetation).  An alternative scenario was determined for this facility.  An estimation, based on a release from a 0.25 aquare inch hold in an anhydrous vapor line while operating at 180 psia and 100 "

      "SummaryText": "degrees F.  This release would occur for approximatley 20 minutes, and would release approximatley 750 pounds into the atmosphere.  Such a release would be caused by a mechanical/equipment failure.  This amount of vapor ammonia realese would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.1 miles.  This cold storage facility complies with the EPA'S Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Enviromental Date Services, Inc.  We have discussed this program with the Independence County LEPC, the Independence County Police/Sheriff's Office, as well as the Batesville Fire Department.  The cold storage system at this facility was constructed in October of 1993, with the addition of storage space, and 17,000 pounds of anhydrous ammoniea for this system completed in November of 2000.  This facility was not required to have a written Risk Management Plan or a written Process Safety Management Plan prior to the new construction in 2000.  However, due to the addition of 17,000 pounds of anhydrous, this facility is now in the process of updation their written programs to be in compliance with all applicable regulations applicable to the facility."
