This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nUS Energy Partners, LLC 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nUS Energy Partners, LLC ethanol plant is located in the City of Russell, Russell County, Kansas.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  US Energy Partners, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.4 miles; due to the amount of denaturant stored on-site.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is based on the release of denaturant stored in a 39,000 gallon above ground storage tank followed by ignitition of the resulting vapor cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of a full tank (39,000 gallons).  The worst-case vapor cloud explosion generates a 1 psig over-pressure endpoint approximately 0.4 miles from the center of the plant.  Major commercial/industrial receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe alternative scenario at the facility is based on release of denaturant from a tanker truck (10,000 gallons) followed by ignition of the resulting vapor cloud.  The alternative vapor cloud explosion generates a 1 psig over-pressure endpoint approximat"

      "SummaryText": "ely 0.2 miles from the center of the plant.  Major commercial/industrial receptors are located within this distance. \n\nAlthough US Energy Partners, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere has never been an onsite or offsite release of denaturant at the US Energy Partners, LLC facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nUS Energy Partners, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC plan has been developed and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  US Energy Partners, LLC 's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety - which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.  US Energy Partners, LLC recently became the first ethanol plant in the U.S. to become part of OSHA's Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARPS)."
