ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nHL Power Company has in place administrative procedures to prevent accidental releases of site regulated substances. These policies can be found in the Process Safety Management Program and in the Business Plan. Emergency response procedures are in place and are presented to new hires as well as annual training for all employees.\n\n\n\nII. STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nHL Power is a 35 MW waste wood fired power plant, which uses Anhydrous Ammonia for emission control.\n\n\n\nMaximum tank  for ammonia is 17,638 gallons. Administrative policies reduce the limits to 85% of tank maximum. The formula for calculating poundage from gallons is;  specific gravity * 8.33 = pound per gallon. \n\n Anhydrous Ammonia has a specific gravity of 0.62, 0.62 * 8.33 = 5.16 pounds per gallon. \n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity stored for the regulated substance are as follows:\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: 85% of 17,638 = 14,992 gallons * 5.16(lb/gal) = 77,359 pounds\n\n\n\n              \n\nIII.  WORST-CASE & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (RMP*Comp)\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst Case Scenario: Tank is struck by a vehicle, which causes a catastrophic release of all contents of the tank. All contents are released in 10 minutes. Release rate is 7,735.9 pounds per minute. Toxic end point is 4.9 miles.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Alternative Case Scenario: Fire on adjacent Propane tank causes the pressure in the Ammonia tank to increase. This increase in pressure causes the tank relief valve to lift. Fog nozzle directed to ammonia tank, which causes the pressure to drop, which allows the relief valve to reseat. Release rate: 402 pounds per minute. Distance to toxic endpoint: 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nIV. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nHL Power Company has administrative procedures in place to prevent overfilling of the Ammonia tank. An offloading procedure has been developed to prevent r"

A remote camera that is controlled from the control room is used to monitor offloading operations. All personnel receive training for all tasks involving ammonia. Emergency procedures can be found in the Business Plan. Training information can be found in the Process Safety Management Program. Training material can also be found in the Certification Training Program.\n\n\n\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nNo accidents involving the regulated substance since 1988 when the plant was built. \n\n\n\nVI. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHL Power Company Emergency Response Program is contained in the Business Plan. This plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed. It is also distributed to all agencies as directed.\n\n\n\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nHL Power Company has a system for communication with the employees on matters relating to occupational safety and health which include:\n\n\n\nThe labor/management Safety Committee meets monthly to discuss safety items. Employees are encouraged to discuss safety and health hazards with committee members. Committee members then bring this up for discussion at the monthly meeting.  Communication is kept anonymous if requested by the employee.\n\n\n\nWeekly Safety Meetings addressing safety related items including new product training, refresher training on required subjects and discussion of Safety Committee recommendations.\n\n\n\nEmployees are encouraged to inform their supervisors of any unsafe condition(s) as soon as it is identified. No Company reprisal will be taken.  This is covered in the New Hire Orientation. Unsafe conditions may be presented to management at any time.  \n\n\n\n"
