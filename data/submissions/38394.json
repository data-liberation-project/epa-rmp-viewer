Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt the Earthgrains Refrigerated Dough Products Carrollton, Texas facility; we handle ammonia that is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility along with the safe operating procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n2.     The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of the Earthgrains Refrigerated Dough Products Carrollton facility is the manufacture, packaging and distribution of baked and frozen goods.   Ammonia is used by the facility's refrigeration system to maintain various temperature levels required by production.  Ammonia is contained within a closed refrigeration system and brought into the facility only to charge the refrigeration system when required.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at the Sara Lee Bakery Carrollton facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as discussed in the following text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] was utilized exclusively. The Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospher"

Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW 5 mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data.\n\n4.     The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThe purpose of the prevention program is to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of ammonia that may result in toxic hazards.  The prevention program applies to ammonia utilized in the Earthgrains Refrigerated Dough Products refrigeration system covered by the EPA RMP standard and the process inventory of ammonia exceeding the specific threshold quantities for individual highly hazardous chemicals listed in CFR 40 Part 68.130 List of Substances.  The prevention program at the Sara Lee Bakery Group, serves as a means of ensuring that facility work processes conform to defined requirements through the preparation and effective implementation of procedures and instructions.\n\nRisk and process safety programs address the planning, organizing, implementing and controlling of each process as well as the identification of those responsible for managing, performing and verifying the work.  The prevention programs for program level 3 requirements are the same as OSHA PSM requirements with some terminology differences.  The format and minimum policy considerations are based on the Risk Management requirements of the latest edition of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 40 Part 68 \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\".  The prevention program elements comprise twelve (12) major program elements that are aligned with OSHA's PSM standard CFR 2"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with industry accepted practice and is in compliance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration ANSI/IIAR 2 Standard for \"Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems\".  All Operators and Technicians have been thoroughly trained using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration training materials.\n\n5.     Five-year accident history.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems located at Earthgrains Refrigerated Dough Products Carrollton, Texas facility has experienced no reportable releases in the past five (5) meeting the reportable criteria as specified in the RMP requirements.\n\n6.     The emergency response program.\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks, and other emergencies.  The plan includes evacuation procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n*   Evacuation Plan\n*   Procedures to Address Serious Accidents\n*   Ammonia Leak Procedures\n*   Emergency Medical Procedures\n\nThe program has been coordinated with the Dallas County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7.     Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe Earthgrains Refrigerated Dough Products facility system for managing risk and process safety has been revised to include the original ammonia process as well as the recent addition.  Although the old process is under the threshold requirement, the system has been included in the risk management and process safety management programs.
