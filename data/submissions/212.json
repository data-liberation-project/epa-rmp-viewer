MOST OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED ON OUR OWN FARM GROUND BUT WE DO SOMETIMES SELL SOME PRODUCT TO NEIGHBORS. OUR FACILITY COMPLIES  WITH THE REQUIRMENTS FOR ANHYDROUS  AMMONIA STORAGE AND IT IS OUR POLICY TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS. IF AN EMERGENCY WERE TO OCCUR , IT IS OUR POLICY TO CONTACT THE STATE CENTER FIRE DEPARTMENT AND REQUEST THAT THEY RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY. THE FACILITY IS INSPECTED TWICE PER YEAR BY THE IOWA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE NECCESSARY CORRECTIONS ARE TAKEN AFTER EACH INSPECTION.\n    OUR WORST CASE  RELEASE SCENARIO  WOULD INVOLVE  A VAPOR CLOUD FROM A RUPTURED TANK THAT WAS 86 PER CENT FULL. THE EPA TABLES GIVE ME A DISTANCE TO END POINT OF 6.9 MILES. IN THAT DISTANCE  THERE ARE 2505 PEOPLE  LOCATED.\n     WE HAVE NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT  INVOLVING ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAUSED DEATH, INJURIES, PROPERTY OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE,  OR EVACUATIONS.\n     IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY INVOLVING OUR  ANYDROUS AMMONIA TANK, IT IS OUR POLICY TO NOTIFY THE STATE CENTER FIRE DEPARTMENT AND HAVE THEM RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY. I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS WITH THE CHIEF OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY ARE PLANNING TO HAVE A MEETING AT THE SIGHT TO REVIEW  THEIR  PROCEDURES.\n     AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF THE FACILITY."
