Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Iowa Double Circle (Libertyville) are\n     committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and\n     propane.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's\n     job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement\n     appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an\n     accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action   \n     Plan and is prepared to work with local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee\n     and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release\n     to employees, the environment, and the general public.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for the direct sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous\n     ammonia is stored in two storage tanks of 28,000 gal and 30,000 gal.  These tanks are located\n     at the far West of the plant.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored in five 1450 gal wagons and\n     thirty-five 1000 gal wagons.  These wagons are stored next to the storage tanks.  The maximum\n     quantity of Anhydrous ammonia would be 439,000 pounds.  Propane is stored in three storage tanks \n     of 18,000 gal, 18,000 gal, and 16,900 gal.  These tanks are located at the far East of the plant.\n     The maximum quantity of propane would be 180,200 pounds.  The maximum fill level of each tank\n      is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level guage.\n                                        "

The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n              tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia - The maximum quanity released would be 127,500 pounds,\n             which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as\n             limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to\n             200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.6 miles.\n\n             Propane - The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds.  The distance\n             to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles.\n\n     b.     The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident hjistory ( or the most\n             likely potential incident), is as follows:\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia - The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a\n             3 - inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an\n             automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The\n             maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint\n             (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.03 miles.\n\n             Propane - The alternate release from hose rupture caused by a pull-away and\n             assumes a 25-foot length of 4-inch transfer hose.  The active mitigation devices\n             are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the \n             hose.  The maximum quanitity released would be 69 pounds.  The distance to the\n             end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n\n\n\n4.

Material Safety\n     Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate\n     the anhydrous ammonia and propane equipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n     2) Hazard Review: Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the\n     handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The reviews identify the opportunity\n     for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards\n     used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n     The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n     anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupational\n     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Staorage and Handling of\n     Anhydrous Ammonia\".
