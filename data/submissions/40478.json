Since then, the ERP has been incorporated \r\ninto Camp Lejeune's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) which is a consolidation of all emergency and contingency plans aboard \r\nthe installation.  The ICP provides guidance and procedures necessary to effectively respond to and prevent fires, explosions, \r\nspills and/or releases associated with petroleum, oils, lubricants, and hazardous materials (to include chlorine).  The ICP was originally \r\ndeveloped in 1999 and is currently (as of CY2004) being updated.  The National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance, outlined\r\nin 61 FR 28642, serves as the basis for Camp Lejeune's ICP.  \r\n\r\nAs part of MCB, Camp Lejeune's Risk Management Program (RMP), a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted at all three \r\nchlorine processes, initially in November 1997 and again in August 2002.  The PHA involved a systematic evaluation of the \r\nhazards posed by each process and risk reduction recommendations were made."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nMarine Corps Base (MCB), Camp Lejeune's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are to maintain \r\nsafe conditions for base personnel and the inhabitants of the surrounding communities.  This policy is to be enforced \r\nthrough compliance with applicable regulations, physical safeguards, training, and deployment of adequate resources.  \r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response are given the highest priority.\r\n\r\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to formulate \r\nregulations for managing and reducing the probability of the release of highly hazardous chemicals.  On June 20, 1996, \r\nEPA promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) requiring any stationary source utilizing greater \r\nthan a specified threshold quantity of a regulated substance to develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) to \r\nregulatory authorities on or before June 21, 1999.  Regulated substances include 77 air toxics and 63 flammable gases \r\nor liquids.\r\n\r\nMCB, Camp Lejeune has three processes subject to EPA RMP regulations:\r\n* Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Holcomb Boulevard water treatment plant (WTP) (Bldg. HP-670);\r\n* Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Hadnot Point WTP (Bldg. HP-20);\r\n* Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), and New River WTP (Bldg. AS-110).\r\n\r\nChlorine is the only substance at MCB, Camp Lejeune in excess of its threshold quantity established in 40 CFR 68.130.  \r\nThe threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton containers and used in the treatment \r\nof drinking water at the three WTPs.  Historically, as many as 180, 150-pound cylinders of chlorine have been stored \r\n(not used) at Lot 201 prior to being transported to Base swimming pools for chlorination.  However, the number of cylinders \r\nstored at Lot 201 has decreased significantly si"

      "SummaryText": "nce MCB, Camp Lejeune recently switched from chlorine to sodium hypochlorite \r\nfor disinfection at all Base pools.  Sodium hypochlorite is not subject to the EPA RMP regulations.  Chlorine storage at Lot \r\n201 was discontinued in August 2001.  The two small-scale water treatment plants that will continue to use the 150-pound \r\ncylinders will store the material onsite, in amounts well below the RMP threshold quantity of less than 2,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessments\r\nThe modeling methodology used in this study conforms to the RMP Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA) Guidance recommended in \r\nthe final RMP rule.  The release scenarios were modeled using RMP*CompTM, an accidental release dispersion modeling package \r\ndeveloped by the CAMEO Team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency \r\nPrevention and Preparedness Office (CEPPO) of the EPA.  All hazard assessments had offsite impacts.  In 2004 the EPA published RMP rule revisions that for security reasons, the OCA release scenarios are no longer required to be described in this executive summary.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release History and Prevention Program\r\nNo accidental releases resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known offsite deaths, \r\ninjuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage have occurred in the previous five years\r\nfrom the covered processes at the three WTPs or Lot 201.  Moreover, no accidents have ever occurred resulting in this type \r\nof damage or human impact. \r\n\r\nAll three chlorine processes are subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety \r\nManagement (PSM) standard and have offsite impacts in the case of accidental release.  Therefore, MCB, Camp Lejeune has \r\ndeveloped and implemented a RMP compliant with all Program level 3 process requirements established by EPA.  \r\n\r\nAn emergency Response Plan (ERP) was developed when the original RMP w"
