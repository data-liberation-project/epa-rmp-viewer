      "SummaryText": "The FASKEN Oil & Ranch Ltd., Mark Merritt Gas Plant is a new facility. This is 60 million ft3/day of ethane and heavier hydrocarbons recovery plant from sweet field gas. \r\n\r\nProcess Overview\r\nThe field gas is treated to remove unwanted components, dehydrated and processed to remove heavy (liquid) hydrocarbons from the gas stream. The process is subdivided into following sections\r\n\r\nInlet processing and stabilization:\r\nThe inlet processing consists of a slug catcher, compression, propane refrigeration system, and stabilization system. The gas flows through the slug catcher, which separates hydrocarbon liquids and water is condensed in the gathering system from the rest of the stream. Condensate is then fed to NGL Tower, which strips ethane and lighter components from the produced liquids. The NGL splitter separates the remaining liquid into a condensate and an NGL stream that will be blended with the product from the cryogenic section of the plant for sales. \r\n\r\nAmine treating:\r\nThe amine unit is designed to remove CO2 from the natural gas stream. CO2 can otherwise freeze in the cryogenic unit forming dry ice and forcing the shutdown of the facility. Amine treating is an exothermic chemical reaction process. The treating solution is a mixture of reverse osmosis (RO) water and diglycolamine (DGA). This aqueous mixture is regenerated and reused. The CO2 reacts with the amine to form an amine carbonate. The amine is now known as rich amine and the remaining gas is sweet and continues to the TEG system. \r\n\r\nTEG system:\r\nThe TEG system is designed to remove water from the natural gas stream in the preparation for cryogenic processing. This is accomplished by contacting lean, dry Tri-ethylene glycol with wet gas in order for any water vapor to be carried off in the glycol steam. The dry gas is sent on for processing, while the rich glycol stream is sent through a reboiler and still column to separate the absorbed water vapor and any hydrocarbons.  The glycol is then ready"

The cryogenic unit recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) by cooling the gas stream to extremely cold temperatures (-160 F) and condensing components such as ethane, propane, butanes, and heavier components. The gas is cooled by a series of heat exchangers and by lowering the pressure of the gas from around 760 psig to approximately 240 psig. Once the gas has passed through the system of heat exchanger and expansion, it is recompressed using the energy obtained from expanding the gas. \r\n\r\nHot oil system:\r\nThe Hot oil system in the plant is used to provide heat to certain processes within the facility. The system will circulate hot oil and deliver heat to other processes. It consists of a Natural gas fired heater, hot oil pumps, hot oil surge tank and heat exchangers.  \r\n\r\nEmergency flare:\r\nThe flare is utilized in the event that the facility needs to be shut down. The sweet gas is than flared for safety purposes until the gas can be shut in at the back field. \r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\n\r\nRisk management plan has been developed to protect the health and safety of the employees, nearby community and to protect the environment. \r\n\r\nNGL is the flammable Chemical mixture.
