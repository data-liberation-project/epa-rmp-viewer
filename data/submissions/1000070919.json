The facilities are designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nThe Johnson and Driver Gas Plants have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Johnson and Driver Gas Plants are located approximately 24 miles southeast of Midland, Texas off of FM 1379 and FM 1357. The plants produce the following petroleum products and byproducts:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as natural gas liquids)\n\n2. Condensate\n\n3. Stabilized Condensate\n\n4. Residue Gas\n\n\n\nThe products contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed facility changes to safety features to ensure these are not compromised. \n\n\n\nC. Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nJohnson and Driver Gas Plants have a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered scenario.  This program systematically examines and explores for potential hazards, then establishes controls to put in place to manage the potential hazards.  The PHA is conducted using checklists with a team consisting of Targa's employees who have operation, maintenance, engineering, and safety experience.  The team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards identified.  The team's findings are forwarded to Targa for resolution.  The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the scenario is no longer operating.

Applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service.  A management of change team will review the use of equipment and determine what action is necessary.\n\n\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Johnson and Driver Gas Plants incorporate quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps to determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\nI. Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nTarga has long-standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, Industrial Standards, and Good Engineering Practice in place to help provide employee, public and process safety.\n\n\n\nJ. Management of Change\n\n\n\nJohnson and Driver Gas Plants have a comprehensive system to manage changes to all Reported Covered Scenarios.  This system requires that changes to items such as equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to:\n\n\n\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n\n2. Verify that existin"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\n\n\nK. Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nTarga promptly investigates incidents related to a covered scenario that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years. \n\n\n\nL. Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nAt least every three years a Compliance Audit addressing OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices are conducted by employees and management of the facility.  This audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed.  Final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nM. Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a description of existing features applicable to prevention of accidental release of regulated substances in this facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nTarga's accident release prevention and response policies are applied to the RMP covered process.
