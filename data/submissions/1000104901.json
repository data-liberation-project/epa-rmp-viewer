Five-Year Accident History \n\nNo releases in the period qualified for inclusion in the Five-Year Accident History. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nFollowing is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at St. Bernard Renewables, LLC. Requirements of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program are contained within our Process Safety Management System (PSMS).\n \n4.1 Employee Participation. PSMS 1.1, Management Leadership, Commitment, and Accountability, ensure active employee involvement and participation in the Process Safety Management Systems (PSMS). Employees are encouraged to participate in the many programs and activities that support the achievement of PSMS, EPA RMP, and OSHA PSM objectives. Participation is essential for an effective safety program and is encouraged for employees (wage or salaried) across groups, departments, and disciplines. Participation addresses three (3) distinct objectives: communication, engagement, and empowerment.\n\n4.2 Process Safety Information. PSMS 4.1, Facility Documentation, requires maintenance of accurate and current information on the configuration and capabilities of processes, facilities, and regulatory requirements. System 4.1 ensures that equipment information concerning the refinery hardware and processes is kept accurate and up to date.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, St. Bernard Renewables, LLC has safety features on the Renewable Diesel Unit (RDU) unit to help (1) contain/control a release, and (2) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n-\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n-\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n-\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process"

Emergency Response Program Information\n\nPSMS 10.1, Emergency Preparedness, requires a prompt, thorough, and effective emergency response to protect employees, contractors, the surrounding community, the environment, and the plant facilities. System 10.1 provides the organizational structure and response plans that are clear, well documented, and accessible to both St. Bernard Renewables, Chalmette Refining, and governmental response personnel. This system also identifies responsibilities and activities necessary to maintain the refinery's fixed and mobile loss prevention and emergency response equipment. \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nOur Process Safety Management System forms the foundation for continuous improvement in our safety-related systems. These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement. Improvements may be identified through the other PSMS systems such as PSMS 2.1 through HAZOP, PSMS 9.1 through Incident Investigation, and PSMS 11.1, Compliance Assessment and Improvement identifies needed improvements. The improvements can be administrative, procedural, or physical in nature. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety are:\n-\tDrive incidents, injuries, and overdue PSM action items to \u0093Goal Zero\u0093\n-\tMechanical Integrity Program Improvements\n-\tImplement Loss Prevention Information System (LPIS)"
