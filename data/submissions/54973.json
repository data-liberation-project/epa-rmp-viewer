This is accomplished through adherence to applicable regulations and corporate policies, hazard assessment; process design; facilities and equipment; procedures, training; investigation of incidents; emergency notification and response programs.  EMD Chemicals Inc. maintains an environmental management system which is certified to fulfill the environmental principles and elements of the ISO 14001 and the Responsible Care programs.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe EMD Chemicals Inc. Norwood facility consists of approximately 23 acres located on both the north and south sides of Highland Avenue at 2909 Highland Avenue and 2910 Highland Avenue.  The operations on the north side are specifically warehousing and distribution of finished goods.  There are also various office spaces on this side of the site.  The operations on the south side include raw material receiving and storage, distillation and packaging of high purity solvents, liquid blending and packaging, repackaging of dry powders, recycling and waste handling, laboratory functions and warehousing of some goods.\n\nRegulated substances handled in excess of threshold limits include chloroform, ethyl ether, formaldehyde, and 37% hydrochloric acid.  Chloroform is received in tank trucks at a tank farm and is off-loaded into an underground storage tank or directly to the process for distillation and packaging.  Ethyl ether and Formaldehyde are received in tank trucks that are unloaded from a spill containment pad near building #4 into the packaging area within the building.  Hydrochloric acid is received as a finished product which is placed in warehouse storage.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nEMD Chemicals Inc. has multiple systems, programs, procedures, equipment and faci"

These include formal process hazard analysis, Responsible Care aspects and impact evaluations, management of change reviews and various safety and environmental audits.  Identification of significant risk leads to new process designs and/or system changes that will help prevent chemical releases.  The site also follows all of the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard as applicable.\n\nThe systems and facilities for handling chloroform provide an example of our release prevention program.  Tank wagons of chloroform are brought on site and parked within a fully contained unloading area.  The entrance and parking are overseen by a trained EMD operator and all unloading activities are managed directly by that operator.  All piping connections, hoses, transfer pumps and related unloading operations are within a concrete dike area that will direct any spill to a collection trench.  As an added protection, spill capture pans are used underneath tank wagon hose connections.  There are chemical vapor sensors above the trench that will alarm in the presence of a spill.  When the material is unloaded into the bulk storage tank, a high level system will prevent overfilling by stopping the pump and providing an audible alarm.  The storage tank is fully enclosed in a concrete vault the will capture a release. Even the storage tanks vent system releases into the capture area.\n\nEquipment in all RMP covered processes has a mechanical integrity and maintenance program to assure continual performance of our systems.  Our management of change system controls modifications to the equipment and facilities.  As a demonstration of the effectiveness of our system, there have been no accidents at the site during the past five years which meet the RMP required reporting criteria.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe s"

The site also has its own trained HazMat team on all shifts while there is scheduled production.  This team is trained and equipped to respond and handle spills which could occur.  There is a specific site wide announcement system for spills that will cause the HazMat team to respond.  Further there is a complete set of emergency procedures in place with an integrated contingency plan.  All EMD Chemicals Inc. employees are trained in their responsibilities during emergencies, whether these responsibilities are active or passive.  The Norwood and Cincinnati Fire Departments are familiar with the facility and scheduled walk-throughs are conducted with them every other year where they observe first hand the facility and the materials handled.  We have also held a table top emergency drill with off site responders.\n\nContinual Improvement\n\nIn 2005, EMD Chemicals, Inc. in Norwood was the eighth site in the country to be certified as a Responsible Care - ISO 14001 facility.  We have maintained this standing through multiple third party audits since then.  This certification means we have a fully functional health, safety, security and environmental management system that has stood the test of time.  An element at the heart of this management system is continual improvement and one to which we fully subscribe."
