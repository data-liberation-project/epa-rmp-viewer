      "SummaryText": "We at the City ofSouth Bay Water Treatment Plant do all we can to promote safety at the work place.  This is especially true when it comes to handling hazardous materials.  We have safety equipment and leak detectors as well as policies and procedures in effect to protect not only the employees but also the general public form any hazardous releases.\n\nOur primary function is the treatment of Lake Okeechobee water into drinking water for the community of South Bay and Lake Harbor.  To this end we use Chlorine gas in the treatment process for color reduction and disinfection.    We currently store on site a two month supply of chlorine gas, approximately 6,000 pounds, or three one ton steel containers.\n\nAs part of developing this risk management plan we were required to examine a worst case scenario.  In this scenario a chlorine cylinder is split open and the entire contents are spilt out within ten minutes.  If this were to happen the toxic cloud would extend out in all directions from the plant a distance of 2.2 miles.  This model is based on EPA's guidance program RMP Comp.  Even with the plant being outside of town this would have a direct impact on the majority of the city residences as well as the public school and the prison.  While the chances of this happening are so slim as to be unthinkable it was required to be considered.\n\nAs an alternative to the worst case scenario we were required to look at another possibility of our own choosing.  I selected a slightly more plausible scenario, a fuseable plug failing.  All chlorine cylinders contain fuseable plugs, which are there to protect the cylinders from over pressurization.  If one was to fail and not be discovered for 2 hours, the resulting toxic cloud would extend out in all directions from the plant for 8/10ths of a mile. Again we used RMP Comp to establish this area.  At this level the cloud would only reach the RV Park and Henderson's trailer park.\n\nAs part of our plan to minimize any potential threat to "

      "SummaryText": "the businesses and residences of South Bay, the operators of the water treatment plant are trained on an annual basis on the handling of chlorine cylinders.  This includes the chlorine cylinder repair kits, which are used to patch or plug holes in the cylinders we use.  We have procedures in place requiring two operators whenever changing cylinders, statistically the most dangerous time for leaks.  We also follow OSHA's process safety management program, which outlines procedures for every thing we do in relation to the chlorine.  We have chlorine leak detectors in place and operational which will give off an alarm if there is even a slight leak which cannot be detected by smell.\n\nAs a result of these measures we have not had an accidental release in the last five years.\n\nOver and above all of this we have a coordinated emergency response program with the South Bay fire department.  The fire department personal is trained in emergency response to these kinds of leaks. We are also coordinated with the county fire department for emergency response. \n\nWe are planning more training for the future and as part of this new program, all future work done on the chlorine equipment is only done by factory certified repairman."
