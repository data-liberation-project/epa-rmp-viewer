      "SummaryText": "1.\tThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nAt the Erie County Sewer District No. 6 (ECSD #6) Lackawanna Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), personnel are continually concerned with the safety of employees, the public, and the environment.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program mandates operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at this facility.  To prevent possible releases of regulated substances, appropriate controls and techniques are used.  If such a release does occur, personnel at the Lackawanna WWTP, through the Division of Sewerage Management (DSM) are coordinated with the Erie County Department of Emergency Services and the Lackawanna Fire Department, whom all commit highly trained emergency response crews to help control and ease the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (primary activities, use of regulated substances, & quantities handled or stored)\n\n\u00b7\tThe Lackawanna WWTP\u00bfs primary activity involves the treatment of wastewater.  Presently, there is one (1) regulated toxic substance above threshold quantity at this facility, which is Chlorine (Cl2).  According to the regulations, the Lackawanna WWTP is required to comply with the Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n\u00b7\tChlorine is used for the disinfection of wastewater, primarily to destroy and/or deactivate pathogenic organisms.\n\n\u00b7\tThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at this facility is 12,000 lbs., which is broken down into six (6) one-ton (2,000 lb.) cylinders.  There are two (2) cylinders on each of the two (2) scales, and the remaining two (2) cylinders on the floor, with only one (1) cylinder in use at any given time.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario (include scenario & distance to endpoint).\n\nThe ALOHA (Areal Locatio"

The following provides a summary of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a disastrous release from one of the chlorine cylinders.  In this particular scenario, 2,000 lbs. (the entire mass of the cylinder) of Chlorine is released in a gaseous form, over a ten (10) minute span.  Under worst case weather conditions being Class F atmospheric stability, 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), 50% humidity, no cloud cover, and 1.5 m/s (3.35 mph) windspeed, the maximum threat zone distance for a level of concentration (LOC) of 0.0087 mg/L is 2.7 miles.\n \nThe ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO for Chlorine involves a release from a single chlorine cylinder and is assumed to be a failure at the transfer hose, due to over pressurization or human error.  In this scenario, 800 lbs. of Chlorine will be released in a gaseous form over a six (6) minute span.  The contents that remain in the tank after the pressurized gas is released will be of liquid chlorine.  This liquid would be at a level lower than the release point and therefore, the contents would remain in the tank.  Under neutral weather conditions (taken from Local Climatological Data 1999-2001 for Buffalo, NY) being Class C stability, 49\u00b0F (9.4\u00b0C), 45% humidity, 5/10 cloud cover, and 9.8 mph (4.38 m/s) windspeed, the maximum threat zone distance for a level of concentration (LOC) of 0.0087 mg/L is 1.7 miles.\n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAt the ECSD #6 Lackawanna WWTP, personnel have taken all the steps needed to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements found in 40 CFR, Part 68.  This facility is subject to the OSHA PSM and EPCRA section 302 standards.  A brief description of the elements in the Release Prevention Program are as follows"

The methodology used to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process was the What If/Checklist.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is reviewed and updated (if necessary) and revalidated every five (5) years.  Any changes resulting from the PHA are completed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nTo safely conduct activities involved within the process, the Lackawanna WWTP personnel maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address each operating phase including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after an emergency shutdown.  Each year, the Chief WWTP Operator reviews the operating procedures and certifies in the annual report that all current operating practices are reflected.  In addition, all operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the process.\n\nTraining\nThe Lackawanna WWTP has an extensive training program in place to ensure that employees involved with the process are completely knowledgeable about the operating procedures and hazards associated with them.  Mandated refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary, to each employee involved in operating the process.  Currently, training is ongoing throughout the year in many areas.\n \nMechanical Integrity\nAt the Lackawanna WWTP, personnel carry out routine maintenance checks, inspections, and testing on all process equipment to ensure proper functioning.  Process equipment that is accounted for, but is not limited to, includes pressure"

Any employee whose job tasks are affected by a change in the process are informed and trained.\n\nPre-startup Reviews \nPre-startup safety reviews related to modifications in the established process are conducted as needed.  These reviews confirm that construction, equipment, safety, operations, and maintenance procedures are in place and adequate prior to startup.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Lackawanna WWTP evaluates compliance at least every three (3) years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audit are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDuring the past five (5) years, there have not been any incidents at the Lackawanna WWTP.  If and when the occasion arises, any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a disastrous release of a regulated substance would promptly be investigated.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Lackawanna WWTP has incorporated any appropriate employee comments into the Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) (Appendix A).  In addition, all employees have access to the information developed under this standard. \n\nContractors\nIf the situation arises that an outside contractor must be hired to perform any maintenance and/or construction work, before choosing a contractor, the Lackawanna WWTP will evaluate information regarding the contractors safety performance and programs.
