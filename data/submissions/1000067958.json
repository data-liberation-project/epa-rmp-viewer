We are one of three warehouses that are  approved by National Association of Chemical Distributors(NACD) affilate Program for Chemical Handlers.\n\n\n\nNACD had an on-site auditing group go over all of our programs. This day long process took two weeks for us to comply with their requests for compliance.  We received our Responsible Distribution Process(RDP ) verification in October 12, 2017. We have been doing Sara reports for since 1995. We have 14 different training programs for our employees for NACD and 20 plus more trainig for DHS (CFATS).\n\n\n\nIn February of 2017, Jensen-Souders was the host facility for a Multi-Agency Exercise.

Among them were multiple Fire Depts, MABAS Division 12 Haz-Mat Team, multiple law enforcement agencies, DuPage OEM, multiple offices of the FBI.\n\n\n\nWe have never had a spill or fire. This is due to management watching over the training programs and we look for situations that could cause harm or fire in the warehouse. The warehouse manager and the owner walk through the warehouse every Tuesday and Thursday with all phone calls on hold.\n\n\n\nThe risk to the community is fire.

We have a security system with motion detectors and cameras on 24-7. Our security is very tight and each employee has an eye out for non-employees without badges. We have multiple J.J.

Hazardous Material Compliance, Hazard Material Regulations, OSHA Compliance Manual and 1910 OSHA guide are among them. \n\n\n\nThe strength of our Risk Management is the company wide buy-in from our employees.\n\n\n\nOur doors are always open to a"
