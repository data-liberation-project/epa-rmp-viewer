Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Greencore USA (Greencore) facility located at 720 Center Avenue in Carol Stream, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This 5-Year Updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?    Introduction;\n\n?    Greencore policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n?    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\n?    Hazard Assessment;\n\n?

Greencore Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Greencore; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Greencore is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Greencore's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). Greencore has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures designed to max"

Facility Identification\n\nThe Greencore facility is located at 720 Center Street in Carol Stream, Illinois.  Greencore is a contract food packaging and co-manufacturing facility that provides manufacturing / processing support, secondary packaging and shipping to suppliers and distribution centers. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 31199.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for packaging and distribution.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating production areas, coolers and freezers throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently onsite has been estimated at approximately 28,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program has been developed to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.

The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - Greencore has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \n\n?    Process Safety Information - Greencore maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed on January 27, 2017.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Greencore has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensured a PHA was conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Greencore conducted a thorough, PHA revalidation study for the refrigeration system during June, 2016. A PHA study was also conducted for changes made to system during January, 2017.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - Greencore has developed a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Annually, the operating procedures are reviewed and certified as accurate. Greencore has developed a site-specific training proc"

Management of Change - Greencore has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented. \n\n?    Pre-Startup Review - Greencore has developed a site-specific pre-startup safety review procedure that ensures a safety review is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity - Greencore has developed a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  \n\n?    Contractor Qualifications - Greencore has developed a site-specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between Greencore and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency action plan and control over entrance into process areas.\n\n?    Incident Investigation - Greencore has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly a"
