The plan includes a regular preventive maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, as well as programs for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system.  The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approacfhes to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system.  Schreiber Foods has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for recurrence of incidents.  The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the Arden  facility.  Lastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Schreiber Foods facilitiy's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of internal emergency response plans with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

The Arden facility located at 21150 Hamburg Avenue, uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the product in manufacturing.  Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM)  regulations, Arden International Kitchens under their parent company Schreiber Foods Inc. (\"SFI\"), has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our partners and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If? Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Arden facility/SFI Home Office,  as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm.\n\nArden/SFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia.  The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system.  The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system.\n\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Arden plant's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, "

      "SummaryText": "Arden/SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases of the largest vessels in the system.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulations requires this review.  Following are a description of the results.\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration\n\nArden stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in manufacturing and in storage.  Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and flexibility, in addition to benefits to employee safety.  Ammonia at the facility is kept entirely within the refrigeration system, much as the refrigerant in your car air conditioner.  The Arden plant has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\nThe worst case scenario, was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 15,108 pound capacity of the high pressure receiver which is located indoors.  The analysis of this release indicates that a potential exposure of an area approximately 1.5 miles in diameter (distance to endpoint of .75 miles).  The total population within the potential exposure area is 846.\n\nIn determining the alternate case scenario for ammonia, Arden/SFI analyzed incicents occurring at other non SFI refrigeration facilities and the results of the internal process hazard analysis (PHA).  The scenario chosen for the ammonia system assumes a 1/2\" hole in a liquid return pipe from the outside condensers.  Such a release would affect an area of 0.34 miles (0.17 miles to the toxic endpoint) and create the potential to affect approximately 43 persons.  Residences and Schools are located with in this area.\n\nArden/SFI is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Arden plant.  Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of th system.  Arden parnters at all levels have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.
