THE OWNER, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CROPMATE COMPANY/UAP 2012 28th AVE. SOUTH MOORHEAD MN.  ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS DISTRIBUTING NON-HAZARDOUS LIQUID FERTILIZERS FOR USE IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AGRICULTURAL MARKET.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED BY RAIL ON A SEASONAL BASIS AND USED AS A CROP NUTRIENT.  AS IT IS UNLOADED IT IS NEUTRALIZED INTO A NON-HAZARDOUS FERTILIZER.  TYPICALLY, AMMONIA IS AT THE FACILITY SEVEN DAYS IN THE SPRING AND SEVEN DAYS IN THE FALL.   \n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF A RAIL CAR IS APPROXIMATELY 150,000 POUNDS. \n     \n III. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE CONTENTS OF A  TANK CAR  AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 150,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE TYPICAL VOLUME OF THE TANK CAR CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS 1.22 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY           \n    (OR THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER        \n    HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS 0.56 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n1. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE      \n    STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE                      \n    AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE,"

AMMONIA IS RECEIVED IN SUPPLIER OWNED CARS IS REGULATED BY FEDERAL DOT STANDARDS.\n\n3. AS CARS ARE RECEIVED, THEY ARE VISUALLY INSPECTED BY THE FACILITY MANAGER FOR ANY SIGNS OF LEAKAGE.  SINCE FACILITY PERSONNEL ARE NOT TRAINED TO MAKE REPAIRS BUT IF DEFECTS OR LEAKS ARE DETECTED, THE FACILITY CONTACTS SUPPLIER AS WELL AS RAILROAD OFFICIALS. \n\n4. A PORTABLE PROCESS UNIT AND TEAM TRAINED TO MEET OSHA PROCESS SAFETY STANDARDS. THEY COINCIDE THEIR ARRIVAL TO PROCESS AND NEUTRALIZE THE AMMONIA CARS.  AS THEY ARE HOOKED TO THE PORTABLE PROCESSOR THEY ARE AGAIN CHECKED BY THE PROCESS TEAM.  SAFETY SHUT OFF DEVICES ARE PLACED IN THE TRANSFER LINES TO PREVENT A RELEASE SHOULD THE TRANSFER SYSTEM FAIL.  FACILITY PERSONNEL ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP AND ASSIST THE PROCESS TEAM DURING THE NEUTRALIZATION PERIOD.  THE PROCESS TAKES APPROXIMATELY SIX HOURS TO COMPLETE.\n                                                                          \nV. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\nA. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE\n    YEARS THAT:\n\n1. HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATH, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE                  \n    FACILITY, NOR\n\n2. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFF-SITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS,            \n    SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. \n\nIN ADDITION TO THE DATA ELEMENTS, AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE PLAN IS REQUIRED BY SECTION 68.155 OF THE RULE, TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE \"LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANNING COMMITTEE\".\n\nTHE FACILITY SHALL PROVIDE IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, A PLAN THAT INCLUDES A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:\n\nA. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE FACILITY.\nB. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nC. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND"
