      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC, Lone Star Plant\nAt Rohm and Haas Texas Incorporated (a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company), we are committed to operating and maintaining all our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors and the public, as well as protection of the environment. The company/corporate policies are embodied in the numerous EHS and Engineering standards which apply globally. At Rohm and Haas Texas, these policies are implemented through the site and global EH&S programs.\n\nFacility Description\nThe Lone Star facility produces a water based Acrylic Emulsion used in the Industrial Coatings Industry as well as some products used for paper coatings.  In the process, the only 2 toxic substances meet the threshold (acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate), and there are no EPA RMP regulated flammable substances. \n\t\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nNote: There are no RMP flammable substances at this facility. \nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical\nThe worst-case scenario (largest impact) is for acrylonitrile. The impact from a worst-case scenario for vinyl acetate would be within the circle for acrylonitrile.\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemical\nThe Alternative case for acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal Road. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n- Process safety information - Our work processes have comprehensive information that are used to guide the choice of process and cont"

These PHAs were used to define the scenarios used in this report. The accident scenarios found in PHAs form the basis of additional analyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems protect both our employees and our neighbors. They also help us target the most important equipment for more frequent inspection.\n- Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble shooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas. The procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. Operators are involved in writing, reviewing, and updating operating procedures.\n- Training \u0096 The facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n- Mechanical integrity \u0096 The facility performs documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel receive specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely man"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training on the modification.\n- Pre-startup review - Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating & maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup, and that all necessary personnel have been trained prior to placing equipment into operation.\n- Compliance audits - Audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule and other applicable regulatory requirements are being followed and have been implemented properly.  Audits are conducted using an established schedule for the site.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n- Incident investigation \u0096 The facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a serious release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root causes leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  \n- Employee participation \u0096 The company operates on the premise that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues, to attend applicable reviews, and to recommend improvements.  Improvements are solicited and implemented as appropriate.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n- Hot work permit - We have had a very effective Hot Work permit, and safe work permit, system"

A monthly management meeting is held to review all contractors' EH&S performance.\n- Hurricane Preparedness - Unit is shutdown in preparation for hurricanes as outlined in the unit's Emergency Hurricane Procedure. Flooding is also included in this plan.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe site has not had any accidents to report as part of the RMP.   \n\nEmergency Response Program\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Our responders are trained annually in various interior and exterior firefighting techniques at Texas A&M University fire school , Hazardous Material Technician response, Emergency Medical Services and Confined Space/High Angle Rescue Techniques. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan by actively participating with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\nThe facility is continuously looking to reduce the number and size/impact of process safety containment events; one area of focus is on Return-to-Operations and ensuring there are no open-ended lines. \nThe facility is also improving safety by implementing the Prevent. Protect. Respond. (PPR) campaign. PPR focuses on strengthening operational discipline, the identification and mitigation of hazards, and executing appropriate action in response to unplanned events.\n\nRevision History\n3/7/24 Fi"
