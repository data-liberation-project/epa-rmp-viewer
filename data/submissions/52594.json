This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 21,150 pounds of material would be released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe Enterprise Whiting Terminal and Storage is owned by Enterprise Terminal & Storage, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mapletree, LLC and operated by Enterprise Products Operating LLC.  .This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* Emergency Response Programs\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Whiting Terminal that are regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Whiting Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline facility as well as a propane storage and loading facility.  The process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe Whiting Terminal has two Department of Transportation regulated pipelines that are routed through the facility.  These two pipelines are a mixed natural gas liquids line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane) and a dedicated natural gas liquids (propane) pipeline.  These pipelines have pumps that are driven by gas turbines, which can add horsepower to"

In addition there is one pipeline leg that comes off the dedicated propane pipeline and is the propane product supply line to the Enterprise Ogden Terminal and Storage facility.   The Whiting facility also receives propane from one of the two natural gas liquids pipelines to a single 90,000 gallon capacity storage tank.  This tank is used for storage and distribution to the two truck transport loading docks which also have capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies. The single propane storage tank is administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nNo toxic chemicals are handled or used at the Enterprise Whiting terminal.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which can be delivered into the single storage tank via the dedicated propane pipeline or the mixed product pipeline.  This material is routed from the tank to the truck transport loading docks for wholesale distribution to propane retailers.  A small quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan is used to stench the propane at the truck transport docks.  However, the Ethyl Mercaptan present at the Whiting terminal is stored in a maximum quantity below the threshold quantity in the Risk Management Program rule.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenario and alternative release scenario for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals present at the Enterprise Wh"

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Monona County Sheriff\u00bfs Department Emergency Management District, which includes the local Whiting Police Department, Monona County Sheriff\u00bfs Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Monona County Sheriff\u00bfs Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from Houston Control which has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by operations personnel.  A third party contractor, 3E Company is under contract to contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.
