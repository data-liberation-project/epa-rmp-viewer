The tank has ample retention space below it, assuring that no material would escape beyond our walls.\n\nProcess\nPipes allow pumped material to enter the production room and into a Chemical reactor tank.  Here the TDI is blended into other ingredients, diluting and reacting it for finished product purposes.\n\nPreventive Maintenance\nPreventative Maintenance involves the regular inspection, testing, and cleaning of related facility equipment and operational systems.  These inspections will help to uncover conditions which might lead to a release of materials.  Thus, allowing for maintenance to prevent such a release.  We weekly inspect (and document) all material stora"

We have developed clear, concise, and easy to follow spill prevention and response procedures for all applicable areas of the facility.  All employees are made aware of the proper procedures. Regarding TDI handling, we follow a check-list that covers all points of the unload from the Tank Wagon.  We have set-up devices to reduce the flow of material, should a problem occur.\n\nResponse Procedures\nOur Plan includes a published Response Procedure.  All employees are taught what to do in case of an emergency.  Instructions are posted throughout the facility. Our ER Plan is assembled complete and available to all employees at any time.\n\nMaterial Handling (TDI)\nWe have trained in the correct unloading procedures for the TDI we place into our storage tank.  A procedures checklist is completed step-by-step as the unloading process is performed.\n\nEmployee Training\nEmployee training is performed & documented.  The more knowledgeable all employees are about the facility's PLAN and what is to be expected of them, the greater the chance that the plan will be successful. Training will consist of on-the-job training and some class room training.\n\nDiversions\nDiversion practices have been installed to divert rain water away from high risk areas and prevent contaminates from mixing with the runoff.  These are surrounding the unloading ramp area\n\nContainment    \nContainment structures have been installed in the Tank Storage Area.  The containment structure exceeds are entire tank storage capacity. \nCatch basins are built into the ramp concrete.\n\nLocal Authorities\nWe have been inspected and permitted by the West Virginia DEP for Storm Water Pollution and for our Air Permit.\nWe have been inspected by our local government to assure no pollution into the municipal water/sewer system.\nThe Harrison County LEPC , led by the Fire Department have inspected, as well as toured (all their fire fighters) "
