As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC has completed a 5-Year Update to its risk management plan (RMP) for  chemicals stored on-site that are above reporting thresholds.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically aqueous ammonia and isopentane/pentane, as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC to notify the Boardman Rural Fire Protection District, Morrow County Sheriff Department, and Morrow County Emergency Management and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process co-product known as wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Aqueous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum aqueous ammonia stored will be approximately 25,000 gallons or 190,000 pounds.  The ammonia tank is located in a concrete containment dike.  \n\n\n\nThe supply and chemical make-up of denaturant is dependent upon market rates and the source of the natural gasoline, making it difficult for the facility to foresee with much ce"

Therefore, Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC has chosen to file this RMP predictively in light of the variable nature of the denaturant supply and has prepared this RMP based on a \"worst-case\" scenario (i.e., use of a denaturant with the most highly-concentrated list of regulated substances).  This \"worst-case\" denaturant contains approximately 21 percent isopentane and 24 percent pentane.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be approximately 78,000 gallons or 460,000 pounds (96,000 pounds of isopentane and 110,000 pounds of pentane).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it relates to the reportable substances.  An emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts periodic drills.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough the completion of this RMP, Pacific Ethanol Columbia, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident Histo"
