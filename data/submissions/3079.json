The plant is situated on\napproximately 5 acres in north Fort Worth.  The immediate\narea surrounding this plant is open undeveloped land to the\nnorth, industrial development including Ferro Corporation\nand residential zoned areas lie to the west,\ncommercial/residential zoned areas to the south, and the\nTrinity River to the east.\n\nSpecialty surfactant manufacturing has been conducted at\nthis location since 1974.  This facility makes a variety of\nspecialty surfactants that are used in industrial and\nagricultural applications throughout the world.  The plant\nis operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Plant\nmanufacturing activity can be categorized into 4 major\nproduct lines employing a total of 44 people.  During normal\noperations, the plant is staffed by 5 hourly plant operators\nand 1 quality control technician.  Four maintenance\npersonnel and nine managers are present during normal office\nhours.  Maintenance and management personnel are on call\nafter normal office hours.   Operators are organized as\nteams with extensive cross training enabling personnel to\nfunction in multiple roles.\n\nOne of the four major product lines produced at this\nfacility is the Morwet D-425 Dispersant.   This product was\nfirst produced in 1978.    35% formaldehyde solution is\nreacted with a sodium naphthalene process intermediate in\ntwo  batch reaction vessels.   The final product of this\nprocess is a water based surfactant with highly efficient\ndispersant properties.   This product is used in\nagricultural product formulations to retard"
