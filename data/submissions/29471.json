The Harvest Land Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Harvest Land Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company,  or other authorities,  to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n-The primary activity at Harvest Land is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n-Anhydrous Ammonia is received,  stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 334,000 pounds which would include two storage tanks.  26,000 and 30,000 gallons, plus rolling stock filled to 85% of volume avalible.  The maximum quantity handled at any one time would be the same as the maximum quantity stored, 334,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\na.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.12 miles.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario is based on a 2 minute release from the break in a 3 inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint is .7 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nHarvest Land has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CRF 1910.111. \"Storage and handling of"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, not to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\nHarvest Land has\n\na.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with the OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\nb.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\nJoel Heiling\nPlant Manager"
