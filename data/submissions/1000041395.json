(ORM - Owner/Operator)\r\nLIGNITE GAS PLANT\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nORM has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. The following is a statement from ONEOK Partners Senior Management.  ONEOK Partners, L.P. (ONEOK - Parent Company) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees.  Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures.  Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies.  Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Lignite Gas Plant (Facility), located near Lignite, North Dakota, uses lean oil absorption, amine absorption, and fractionation to process sour wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances and one toxic substance are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate, and hydrogen sulfide).  There is appro"

The facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.  However the facility does remove and compress the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) present in the raw well head gas into an approved injection well outside of the plant boundary but on Company owned property (total of 1,384 lbs of H2S on site).\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 288,900 pounds of propane from the plant\u00bfs largest liquid petroleum gas (LPG) storage vessel (TK-S701 A).  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for administrative controls for maintaining a maximum of 90% level in the tank were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 mile.  Two public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.50 mile radius.  The two public receptors were residences.  Estimated residential population within the 0.50 mile radius is 5 people.  \r\n\r\nThe most likely alternative release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance that reached a public receptor was a failure of a propane loading hose during truck loading from a storage tank.  Release volume was assumed to the entire contents of the vessel.  The ARS assumed a  253,800 lb release of propane liquid/vapor to atmosphere over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.3 mile.  Zero public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.3 mile endpoint radius.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant\u00bfs PSM and accidental release prevention programs.  These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Lignite Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process and annually certified as current and accurate.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Lignite Gas Plant's Operating Procedures provide guidance on how to respond to specific process or equipment parameters that exceed the parameter upper or lower limit.  Operating Procedures are readi"

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Lignite Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Lignite Gas Plant evaluat"

Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Lignite Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that the accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Lignite Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

Inspections and tests are performed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or place temporary safeguards in place to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repair.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practice\r\n\r\nThe Lignite Gas Plant has long-standing, safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThe Lignite Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in plant monthly emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other ONEOK Partners facilities.  The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall ERP for the Lignite Gas Plant is coordinated with the Burke County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan.  The local responder for plant emergencies is the Burke County Sheriff's Department and the Lignite Volunteer Fire Department.  The Lignite Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, sheriff's office).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well"
