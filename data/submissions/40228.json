Our mission includes a commitment to act as responsible neighbors in our communities. We will accomplish our mission by adhering with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility has developed an emergency response plan and has coordinated response activities with the Marshall Fire Department.\n\nThis facility processes pork for market distribution and ultimately for public consumption. Ammonia refrigeration is used throughout the plant for all areas that require cooling. The system includes receiving tanks, compressors, chillers, freezers, condensers, and associated piping, valves, and other equipment. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. In addition, the facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. Our prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, a contractor safety program, management of change, and pre-startup safety reviews. In addition, we have implemented a training program to ensure that our employees are knowledgeable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions. If an incident does occur, it is thoroughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all affected employees. We believe our prevention program is key to minimizing the risk to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had an accident involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving ammonia, we will implement our emergency response plan. If necessary, we will also notify the Marshall Fire Department and request that"
