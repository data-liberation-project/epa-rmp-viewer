NOVA Chemicals is committed to being a leader in achieving superior Responsible Care (i.e. RC) performance and its management programs require each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of Nova Chemicals Responsible Care and Sustainability Policy.\n\n\n\nThe Beaver Valley Plant's approach to chemical safety and accidental release prevention is best described by the NOVA Chemicals Responsible Care and Sustainability Policy which states \"The following principles reflect the ethic of Responsible Care and sustainability and guide our actions as we carry out our mission.\"\n\n\n\n1.    Operate our facilities and Responsible Care systems to meet or exceed the letter and spirit of industry codes of practice, regulations and legal requirements.\n\n2.
