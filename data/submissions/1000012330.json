PBA's main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  Production at the facility was initiated in May 2004.  PBA produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and liquefied.  The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\n\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 2,000,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored in Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 65,000 gallons (approximately 409,000 pounds), and potentially in Tank 802, which has a capacity of 192,500 gallons (approximately 1,211,000 pounds).  NGC is blended with the ethanol via in-line blending, and the denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank trucks and rail cars.\n\n\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER EPA's CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical present at PBA which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC unloading platform, the NGC storage tanks, the in-line blending equipment, the denatured ethanol loadout platform, and the associated transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration range of 2% to 5%.  The greatest CAPP regulate"

In the event of an emergency, PBA's Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of PBA to notify the Ashton Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPBA is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms.  All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR"

There have been no accidents since start up of the plant in May 2004 which require inclusion in the five-year accident history required by Subpart B of the CAPP/RMP regulation. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPBA's management team and operations/maintenance personnel are committed to an on-going system of reviewing changes in available technologies and any previous plant incidents to identify opportunities to improve plant safety.  Planned changes to improve safety include continued enhancement of the computer based maintenance program (Maximo), which is being implemented to include automatic scheduling and work order generation for all preventative maintenance inspections and tests.\n\n"
