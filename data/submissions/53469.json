Approach To Regulatory Compliance\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 and the California Process Safety Management Program, CCR Title 8, Section 5189 as enforced by the local Certified Unified Program Agency and the Fed/EPA.  \n\nThis program is intended to be a ?living document.?  As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible. To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.   \n\n1.    THE  STEVCO COLD STORAGE, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Stevco Cold Storage has updated their unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California?s Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program L"

This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Stevco Cold Storage business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2.    DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Stevco Cold Storage facility is a commercial cold storage facility for table grapes.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to one cold room equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  This room is designated as a ?precooling? room, while ten others are cold storage rooms.  Both kinds of rooms are equipped with ?bunker style? evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  There is a cooled loading dock, hallway, and repack room as well.  A com"

      "SummaryText": "puter system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a series of a liquid feed solenoid valves.  From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the roof.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to one of two primary accumulator vessels located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.  There are three high pressure receivers, however, they are piped together so that they act in concert.   \n\nThe facility was built in 2000 and added to in 2001, 2006, and 2008 by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system ex"

Lastly, an emergency ?dump box? contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\n\n\n3.    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the Stevco Cold Storage facility are an integral part of the overall business.  The system contains a total charge of approximately 56,400 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n4.    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nStevco Cold Storage has not had any reportable chemical related accidents within the last five years. \n\n5.    EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California "

Under this plan we will call emergency personel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done by the local fire department and the Bakersfield City Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release.\n\n6.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Stevco Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Stevco Cold Storage business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a form"

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Stevco Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Stevco Cold Storage will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
