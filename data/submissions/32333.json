Our chlorination room houses a maximum of four 1-ton cylinders of chlorine (8000 lbs max).  Disinfection is seasonal from April 1st through September 31st each year.  There are normally two 1-ton cylinders on-line. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention: \nOur plant safety program includes formalized staff training on proper cylinder changing procedures and proper emergency response actions in the event of an uncontrolled release of chlorine gas.  In the event of a significant chlorine release our WWTP staff has been instructed to immediately exit the chlorine room, shut off all ventilation fans to help contain any chlorine within the room, and contact the Bozeman Fire Department who will dispatch their Hazmat team to assist us.   \n\nEmergency Response Program: \nThe Bozeman Fire Department employs a full-time staff of firefighters who are trained in Hazmat response procedures.  \nIn the event of an emergency at the WWTP the Bozeman Hazmat Team will be dispatched by calling 911.  This team is fully equipped with proper Class A protective gear, chlorine cylinder repair kits, and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus. \n\nGeneral Safety Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \nThe chlorination facilities at the Bozeman WWTP are equipped with the following safety gear:  \nA.  A \u00bfClass B\u00bf 1-ton emergency cylinder repair kit. \nB.  5-minute emergency escape air packs. \nC.  All safety wrenches and tools necessary to safely change a 1-ton cylinder. \nD.  An audible chlorine alarm system to alert the WWTP staff of any leak. \nE.  Panic hardware on exit doors to facilitate rapid escape. \nF.  Two ventilation fan systems. \nG.  Two Hydro cylinder-mounted chlorinators that stop"

A certified and inspected 2-ton cylinder hoist. \nJ.  Proper cylinder changing procedures and emergency phone contacts posted  \n        on the wall. \nK.  Face shields and chemical safety goggles. \n\nFive Year Accident History: \nThere have been no reportable chlorine incidents within the last 5 years.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe Bozeman WWTP intends to change its primary means of disinfection within the next three years.  After July 1, 2004 we intend to retain an engineering consultant to assist us in the design of a ultra-violet (UV) disinfection system for the Bozeman WWTP.  We anticipate the installation of this UV disinfection system will eliminate the need to store and use 1-ton cylinders of chlorine at the Bozeman WWTP.  When this plant modification is completed we will notify the EPA and file a request to be de-registered."
