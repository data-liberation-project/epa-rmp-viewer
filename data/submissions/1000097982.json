Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  BJ's Distribution has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nBJ's Distribution has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nBJ's Distribution has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of an emergency action plan, including evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Only authorized outside personnel (fire department, EMS, etc.) may perform emergency rescue and medical duties. Our emergency action plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Rocky Hill Fire Department. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner."

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\nBJ's Distribution conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\nBJ's Distribution promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n- Employee Participation\r\nBJ's Distribution truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
