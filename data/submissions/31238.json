There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant using a consulting organization. A PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\noWritten site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\noChlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\noStandard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\noChlorine system maintenance procedures \n\noTraining on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\noConducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine processe\n\noDeveloping an initial Emergency Response Plan \n\noTraining in support of the certification of operators\n          \nThe plant superintendent and the company safety managers annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations. Recent activities include RMP Self-Audits in late 2003 and RMP training in March 2004. \n\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plant has implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals\n\noIn 1991 when the plant was constructed, a full vacuum chlorine delivery system as installed. This process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\noPlant inventories are controlled to maintain only two cylinders connected to the process and two cylinders in reserve.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) have been significantly upgraded.

The services of a professional organization to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are routinely conducted.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. Hydro Management Services has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nAt the Water Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\n- Lockout/Tagged\n\n- Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries over the past three years. As mentioned earlier, there have no reportable chlorine releases from the plant in the last five years.
