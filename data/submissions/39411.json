The Wildwood WWTP stores as much as 8,000 lbs of chlorine gas in one-ton cylinders The City of Wildwood developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorine chemical storage and feed facilities in June 1999, in accordance with 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA Process Safety Management Standards). The EPA Chemical Accident Protection rule (40CFR68) applies to any process that involves more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine (gas). The OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR1910.119) applies to any process that involves more than 1,500 pounds of chlorine. The City\u00bfs RMP was submitted to EPA using the agency\u00bfs RMP Submit program.\n\nA compliance audit of the Wildwood WWTP RMP was conducted on June 11, 2004, in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.79.  The audit concluded that the Wildwood WWTP operations are in general compliance with the RMP prepared in June 1999.  \n\nThere have been no incidences or chemical release reported in the last five (5) years.\n\nRMP Summary\n\nThe Wildwood WWTP RMP is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1 \u00bf Emergency Response Plan\n\nThis section documents the procedures to be followed to control process upsets and chemical leaks.  The ERP provides procedures to be followed by wastewater personnel for handling minor incidental chlorine releases.\n\nFor major chemical releases, the ERP calls for the Wildwood  HAZMAT team (division of the City fire department) to be the first responders.  After notifying the HAZMAT team of a major release occurrence, WWTP personnel are to evacuate the area and allow HAZMAT personnel to take the appropriate emergency response and public notification a"

Process hazard analysis, prestart up safety reviews, Management of Change procedures and forms, incident investigation procedures, inspections and compliance audit requirements, training, including updates and development of continuing improvements used by the City.\n\n\n\nSection 4 \u00bf Hazard Assessment: Offsite Consequence Analysis/ Five-year Accident History\n\nThe potential impacts of possible future chlorine release were analyzed in accord with the guidance that USEPA set in its Risk Management Program Guidance for POTWs.  The assessment determines the distance at which the plume would dilute to a concentration at which people would suffer no serious permanent harm, but would voluntarily go to the hospital for evaluation.  For the worst case scenario, it is assumed that a ton container will completely empty in ten minutes.  Although highly unlikely, this is the worst possible case for the plant.  In the worst possible case, the EPA table yields a \u00bfdistance to toxic endpoint\u00bf of the 3.0 miles for the type of landscape (rural) in which the plant is located.  Within the 3.0-mile radius of the plant, there are schools, a hospital, recreation areas, commercial/office sites, and residences.  An estimated 4,000 people live within a 3.0-mile radius of the plant, based on population projections using 2000 Census data.  \n\nAn alternative worst-case scenario was also analyzed using more typical release rates, temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric stability. This results in a chlorine plume with an end point of 0.1 miles for the type of landscape (rural ) in which plant is located.\n\nThere has been no accidental release of a regulated substance (chlorine) where exposure to the substance or its reaction"
