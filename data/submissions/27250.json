      "SummaryText": "\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCanyon Regional Water Authority (CRWA) owns the Hays/Caldwell surface water treatment plant located approximately two (2) miles east of San Marcos, Texas.  The plant is staffed and operated by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority (GBRA.)  The plant provides wholesale water service to the public water systems of Martindale Water Supply Corporation, Maxwell Water Supply Corporation, County Line Water Supply Corporation and Crystal Clear Water Supply Corporation.\n\nThe plant is situated in a rural setting on the banks of the San Marcos River.  The facility uses chlorine gas as the primary water disinfectant.  The entire supply consists of four (4) 2,000-pound cylinders.\n\nThe process system consists of two (2) steel pressure manifold units, with two (2) 2,000-pound cylinders per unit.  A vacuum activated switchover unit isolates the two systems.  A chlorine leak detector, set to 1 ppm, with a sensor mounted approximately 1-inch above the floor is connected to an audible alarm system.  The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times a day by an on-site operator and monitored daily on the weekends.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly with all manifold piping replaced annually, regardless of condition.\n\nEmergency support will be provided by the San Marcos Fire Department.  The GBRA also staffs the City of San Marcos water treatment plant, located five (5) minutes away.\n\nAn emergency action plan is being prepared, which is maintained on-site at the plant office.  The plan includes:\n1.    Identification of an incident commander, operations and safety coordinator, and information coordinator.\n2.    Assignment of entry team, backup team, and decontamination team.\n3.    Compilation of incident checklists and emergency notification lists in a central location.\n4.    Compilation of all MSDS in a central location.\n5.    Mapping for the immediate area with identification of all residents and businesses which might be potentially affected."
