The facility is a producer of custom and branded snack cakes and muffins primarily for retail distribution. \n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311813. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients and products.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating baked goods ingredients and products. \n\nThe anticipated ammonia charge for the refrigeration system has been calculated at 12,951 pounds.  The ammonia refrigeration system was originally put into service during the fall of 2007, however, at that time the system was charged with approximately 9,000 pounds.  Because the amount of ammonia was under the 10,000 pound threshold, an RMP was not submitted at that time.  A recent addition to the ammonia refrigeration system will result in approximately 3,000 additional pounds being added to the system.  \n\nThe refrigeration system is used to cool process rooms, holding freezers, coolers, docks, and blast freezers.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two (2) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The ?low pressure? equipment includes one (1) spiral freezer and two (2) storage freezer evaporators, one (1) low temperature pump receiver (V-4) with ammonia pumps (AP1 and AP2) and oil pot (V-5), and two (2) low temperature booster compressors (RC-1 and RC-2).  The ?high pressure? equipment includes two (2) +60 - 70 muffin room evaporators, three (3) +60 ? 80 autobake cooler evaporators, one (1) +40 finished product staging evaporator, one (1) +40 vestibule evaporator, two (2) +70 dry bulk cooler evaporators, one (1) +70 cup room evaporator, one (1) water chiller, two (2) +60"

Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\nV.Hazard Assessment ? Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario.\n\nVI.General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The first audit of the PSM program will occur by July 31, 2010, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n?Employee Participation ?
