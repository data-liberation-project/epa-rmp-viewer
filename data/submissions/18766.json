THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 37,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  \nTHE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT OF .14 mg/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 1.40 MILES.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT OF .14 mg/L FOR THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS .19 MILES.  THIS RELEASE HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING BEYOND THE FACILITY BOUNDARY.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\nTHIS FACILITY COMPILES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL APPLICABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THIS FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REFQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA , K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY TEH AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.
