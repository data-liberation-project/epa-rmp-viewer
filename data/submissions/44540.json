      "SummaryText": "Facility Background and Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\nAt the Phoenix Cavern facility we handle butane and propane (LPG), both of which are recognized by the EPA as regulated, flammable substances.  The same properties that make butane and propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in their handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, located in Rocklin, CA, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel or Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.   \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to store and distribute LPG products to wholesale customers.  LPG is received by pipeline into the Cavern facility and distributed to customers by railcar or transport trucks.  The LPG products (Butane and Propane) are stored in 3 underground caverns in the Luke Salt body deposit.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\nThe maximum amount of"

      "SummaryText": "LPG products that can be stored on site is 3.5 million barrels.  The significant factor to consider here, which precluded this amount of product from being reported in the worst case scenario, is these caverns start at over 900 feet below the surface, are contained within a concrete reinforced well head, and are part of a salt formation which is rock solid and estimated to be over 10,000 feet deep.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prevention of incidents, injuries and releases at the facility.  Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection, a site specific mechanical integrity program, and preventive maintenance practices.  The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and various metering and dehydrating equipment is minimized via extensive inspection and painting programs.  \n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, there are Emergency Shutdown switches located through out the facility which  include automatic positive shutoff valves at the wellheads, truck loading rack, and other critical overpressure interlocks designed to shutdown affected equipment or isolate a problem once detected.  \n\nShould a minor accident or incident occur, emergency response training, fire fighting equipment, and system knowledge by the operators would help minimize the hazard associated with the leak.  In addition, a continuously operating flare is in service on site to minimize gas emissions to the atmosphere during normal and upset conditions."

In addition, the site complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations, including the Arizona Oil & Gas Commission regulations governing the underground storage caverns.  When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.  \n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association\u00bfs (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility experienced one accident meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.  The incident involved the release of 20 gallons of propane from a truck loading arm.  Because the release was small, no off-site consequences resulted, although two personnel located on-site in the vicinity of the release received minor thermal burns.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility is considered a non-responding site and as such it maintains only an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for notification of local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations.  Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel.  Should an actual incident occur the EAP gives guidance to employees on how to respond to minor accidents, incidental spills and/or small fires.  Larger emergencies require assistance from local emergency response organizations and on-site personnel are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\n\nThe EAP is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and as stated above, employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise.

The odorant injection system is being upgraded in order to significantly reduce fugitive emissions and minor leaks.  In the future, the site plans to replace existing truck rack loading arms, flow control valves, isolation valves and other miscellaneous equipment in order to improve the reduction of fugitive gas emissions.  Further improvements of this nature just described will be made as needed to maintain or improve site integrity, reliability, and plant safety."
