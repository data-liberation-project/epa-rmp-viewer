      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDakota Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant as well as the anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.   The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Dakota Ethanol to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant, it is the policy of Dakota Ethanol to notify the City of Wentworth Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDakota Ethanol operates an ethanol fuel production plant located near Wentworth, in Lake County, South Dakota.  The faciliy produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain 30 to 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 190,152 pounds.  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is llocated in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 100,800 pounds.  \n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a release of the full contents of the tank in 10 minutes time during the most stable atmosph"

According to RMP*Comp, a software tool developed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for use in performing off-site consequence analysis, the maximum estimated distance from the facility's center to a one pound per square inch overpressure is 0.5 miles.  The estimate number of human receptors within the 0.5 mile radius of the plant is 6 persons.  The analysis assumed a release of 190,152 pounds of denaturant (the entire contents of the tank), a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and an air temperature of 77 degrees F.  This was an overconservative approach in assuming the denaturant release was 100 percent pentane.  In actuality, pentane content in denaturant is only 30 to 40 percent.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario defined by the same guidance as above for the anhydrous ammonia tank assumed a toxic gas cloud of 100,800 pounds (entire contents of the tank) released in 10 minutes.  A wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and air temperature of 77 degrees F were also assumed for this release.  The maximum distance from the facility for this worst-case release is 4.7 miles.  The estimate number of human receptors within the 4.7 mile raduis of the plant is 200 persons.   \n\nAlternative Case Releases\n\nAlternative case scenarios are a more realistic approach to any potential accidental release at the facility due to the fact that mitigating equipment is taken into account.  The alternative case scenario evaluated using RMP Guidance was a failure of the largest natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  According to RMP*Comp, the maximum estimated distance from the facility's center to the Lower Flammability Limit for pentane (1.5%) is less than 0.1 mile. The estimated number of human receptors within a 0.1 mile raduis of the plant includes plant personnel and no public receptors.  The analysis assumed a release rate of 2000 "

The anlysis also assumed the release occurs in a diked area since the Dakota Ethanol tank farm is located in a diked secondary containment area.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario was evaluated for a release of anhydrous ammonia as a toxic gas due to a 10 minute release from a 2 square inch puncture or removal of the largest pipe.   This scenario will affect a  distance  radius of 0.5 miles from the plant, which would include an estimated 6 persons.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Dakota Ethanol has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nDakota Ethanol is a new facility and does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  This facility will begin operation by September 1, 2001."
