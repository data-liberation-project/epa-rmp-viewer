      "SummaryText": "Like most food manufacturing facilities, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant\navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by accidental release prevention regulations handled at the Vineland facility.\n\nCasa di Bertacchi is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\nand standards where appropriate.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  Our RMP program includes elements addressing:\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\nrefrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\n- Contractors: We carefully screen contractors"

      "SummaryText": " who work on our property to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n- Hot Work Permits: We strictly control welding and other work that could start a fire near the ammonia equipment.\n- Emergency Response: We have an emergency response plan that enables trained personnel to respond to ammonia releases.  We coordinate our response to emergencies with the local Fire Department.\n- Incident Investigation: After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n- Compliance Audits: Approximately every  3 years, we examine the safety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n- Trade Secrets: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets program in case confidential information affecting the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n- Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing progress of safety items.\n\nThere have been no ammonia related accidents during the past 5 years that had significant on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nThrough our RMP program, Casa di Bertacchi looks continuously for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility.  Three equipment changes designed to improve safety were suggested during a 2011 analysis of the system; these changes are currently being addressed at the facility."
