It is essential that emergency pre-planning and training make employees aware of, and able to execute, proper actions.  For this reason, an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the entire facility has been developed and implemented in accordance with the provisions of other OSHA rules (8 CCR 3220).

The geological settings of this facility were reviewed extensively by the previous owner of this facility and the County of Santa Barbara during the environmental impact review.  This information was used to design the process structures of the facilities.  Based on this information, conservatism was integrated into the civil and seismic design criteria beyond Uniform Building Code.  These criteria and specific engineering drawings were approved by a third-party professional engineer for the Santa Barbara County Building Department.\n\nThe review and approval of building permits for the design and construction of the facility provides reasonable assurance that the release of any regulated substance having offsite consequences will not occur because of an earthquake.  The seismic design criteria, coupled with the mechanical and building codes, and a comprehensive and rigorous equipment testing, and inspection program are primary mitigations to seismic and other external events. \n\nIn addition, Title 19 of the California Code of Regulat"

It is the policy of FM O&G that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any off-site impacts that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this end, FM O&G strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. FM O&G has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., personnel training, safety consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  The company's philosophy is to implement reasonable mitigation measures to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances as well as non-regulated substances. \n  \nThe Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant activates its emergency response policies to comply with the overall FM O&G policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\nUnified Command will be established with Santa Barbara County Fire Department Oil and Gas Supervisor.  Additional resources will be requested as needed to accommodate the needs of the incident. \n\n1.2\tFacility Description\n\nThe Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant is located approximately 12 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 1.5 miles northeast of Vandenberg Village."
