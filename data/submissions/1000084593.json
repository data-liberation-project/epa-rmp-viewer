The Hattiesburg Water & Sewer Department accidental release prevention policy involves operational procedures, management practices and continued training to prevent accidental releases. Continued improvement of facilities and procedures will reduce accidental releases.  The response policy involves procedures to notify and coordinate response with local responders.\n\nB.  Hattiesburg South Lagoon is one of two wastewater treatment facilities serving the City of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  Chlorine gas is used to disinfect the wastewater at this location after it has been treated.  Sulfur Dioxide is used to remove the chlorine residual. This facility is located in the southeastern section of the city at 1903 E. Hardy St. The maximum amount of chlorine at this facility would be eight one-ton containers.  The maximum amount of Sulfur Dioxide would be six one-ton containers.  This facility is  checked seven day a week.  \n\nC.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two Chlorine and two Sulfur Dioxide release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release scenario\" and \"alternative scenario\".  Both scenarios were calculated using EPA's RMP* Comp software.\n\n\n\nFor Chlorine , the worst case scenario involves a failure of a one-ton Chlorine cylinder with a 10 minute release and a release rate of 110 pounds per minute.  This scenario involves a release in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air. \n\nThe alternate release scenario involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in a release duration of 60 minutes. \n\n\n\nFor Sulfur Dioxide, the worst case scenario involves a failure of a one-ton cylinder with a 10 minute release duration and a release rate of 110 pounds per minute.  This scenario involves a release in an enclosed space in direct  contact with outside air.  \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failu"

      "SummaryText": "re with a release duration of 60 minutes. \n\n\n\nD.  The accidental release prevention program is based on the following elements:\n\n1. Training of operators.  2. Preventive maintenance program.  3. Use of process and safety equipment.  4. Use of effective operating procedures.  5. Reviews of operational procedures, training, hazards and safety information.  Chemical specific prevention steps include the availability of self contained breathing apparatus and awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nE.  No accidental releases of chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide have occurred at this facility in the past seven years.\n\n\n\nF.  Our facility is included in a community emergency response plan.  Our employees will not respond to an accidental release other than to notify the Hattiesburg Fire Department.  Emergency response will be handled by the Hattiesburg Fire Department's Hazard incident response team.\n\n\n\nG.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide cylinders are stored in a building to protect them from direct sunlight and and somewhat contain initial leak.  Leak detectors are installed to alert operators of an accidental release.  Internal training as well as training by outside sources is conducted on a regular basis."
