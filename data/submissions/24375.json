Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Bayer Corporation Institute Plant that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Bayer Corporation Institute Plant is a tenant facility within the Aventis (formerly Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc) Institute Plant.  Bayer Corporation has a contract with Aventis to obtain emergency response services from the Aventis Institute Plant Emergency Response Team and the Aventis  Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  The Institute Plant maintains a highly trained emergency response team to provide safe and appropriate response to any type of plant emergency and hazardous materials incident.  It also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems through the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC).    \n\nThe Institute Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including:\n\u00b7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures \n\u00b7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n\u00b7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n\u00b7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n\u00b7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergenc"

Products made from these materials fill the supermarket shelves and go into automobiles, housing, clothing and other necessities that improve the quality of life by making products safer, healthier and more convenient.\n\nThe products made at our South Charleston and Institute facilities belong to a family of chemicals called polyether polyols, and are derived from a chemical called propylene oxide, which is supplied by a Lyondell plant on the Gulf Coast.  Polyols are used primarily in polyurethane foams for products ranging from bedding and furniture, to automotive applications such as seat cushions and energy absorbing instrument panels and side panels.  Nearly two-thirds of all the auto seats in the U.S. today are made using the Bayer Corporation polyols products from the Kanawha Valley. Other polyols products we make here are used by our customers for applications as diverse as roof coatings, varnishes, roller blade wheels, and bowling balls.  All of the products are shipped to customers in other states or are exported to Europe, Asia, and South America.\n\nAnother product from our South Charleston and Institute West Virginia facilities is technology. The scientists and technicians at our South Charleston Technical Center work closely together with our manufacturing organization here to develop new or improved polyols produ"

These new technologies can then be used by other Bayer Corporation polyols manufacturing sites around the world.\n\n\nRESPONSIBLE CARE\u00ae\n\nBayer Corporation is fully committed to the principles of Responsible Care, which is an initiative of the American Chemistry Council (ACC to improve industry performance in the areas of environment, health and safety, to improve the industry's safe management of chemicals, and to respond to public concerns. The American Chemistry Council (ACC) was formerly called the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA).  Since 1990, emissions of hazardous chemicals to the air from the Bayer Corporation South Charleston and Institute West Virginia facilities have been reduced by over 90% through improving processes and eliminating inefficient operations.  We have also made continuous improvements in our safety performance every year and rank among the industry leaders in this important aspect.  It is a policy of Bayer Corporation to establish goals for continuous improvement in the areas of health, safety, and the environment based on sound science, risk assessment and benefit analysis, against which we will measure, audit and communicate our performance.\n\nAnother initiative for continuous improvement is called Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence was formerly called Manufacturing Excellence under Lyondell Chemical Company and ARCO Chemical Company. Operational Excellence, based on the Manufacturing Excellence Program launched in 1991 by ARCO Chemical Company, is a program of corporate standards and management systems which incorporates all of the Responsible Care\u00ae  Codes of Management Practices, best practices in the chemical industry, and Bayer Corporation's own rigorous management systems. Operational Excellence, incorporates a system of Operational Excellence Standards based on the Manufacturing Excellence Standards which ensure superior performance and continuous improvement in the following five key ar"

The Operational Excellence System consists of 43 performance standards in the key manufacturing functional areas (e.g. HES, Operations, Maintenance, Engineering, Supply Chain), and a system of Bayer Corporation Facility Audits and Third Party Audits to evaluate compliance with the performance standards. The Third Party Audit System evaluates the regulatory compliance, reliability, and liability associated with the following types of third parties:  Waste Sites, Terminals, Tollers, Key Suppliers, and Transporters.  A rigorous auditing process evaluates how well our facility is meeting the high standards of Operational Excellence.  Audit teams composed of experts, from various Bayer Corporation facilities and the corporate auditing department, examine performance, site conditions, and documentation to make sure the Operational Excellence Standards are met.\n\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Bayer Corporation Institute Plant is a tenant facility within the Aventis (formerly Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc) Institute Plant.  Bayer Corporation has a contract with Aventis (formerly Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc) to obtain emergency response services from the Aventis Institute Plant Emergency Response Team.  \n\nThe Bayer Corporation Institute Plant, is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include Bayer Corporation's Operational Excellence requirements (formerly called Manufacturing Excellence), Institute Plant's Responsible Care\u00ae requirements, and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR Part 68) and the Occupa"

In developing worst-case scenarios, companies must presume the release of the entire quantity of the largest container of a regulated chemical over a 10-minute period.  Only passive mitigation systems, such as those that do not require energy or action by an employee to initiate can be considered.  U.S. EPA acknowledges that these worst-case scenarios are unlikely to occur, so the RMP rule also requires that companies develop alternative release scenarios based on more credible release assumptions. \n\nAlternative release scenarios differ from worst-case scenarios in several important ways.  They may be based on actual incident history or on events which are more likely to occur, and allow the use of both active and passive mitigation to reduce the potential impact of a release on the community outside the facility.\n\nEPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Tables were used for evaluating the consequences of the WCS and ARS for both regulated flammable and toxic materials.  Use of these tables resulted in the determination of a release endpoint distance. The EPA-recommended LANDVIEW program was used to estimate the number of people potentially affected in each scenario.  The West Virginia Kanawha/Putnam County Emergency Services Maps and CD-ROM Program were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within the scenario endpoint distance.\n\nAccording to the RMP rule, the release endpoint distance is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected for each scenario.  It is intended to ensure that potential risks to the public health are recognized.  For toxic releases, the endpoint is the distance beyond which chemical concentrations are low enough that an average individual could be exposed for up to one hour without suffering irreversible or debilitating health effects.
