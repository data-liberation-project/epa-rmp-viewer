The facility operates two processes that are subject to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Planning regulation: two 10,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks.  The ammonia is used as a feed material for fermentation.\n\nThis Executive Summary has been prepared to provide an overview of the facility's Risk Management Plan, and address the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 68.155(a)-(g).  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \nThe Roche Vitamins facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management regulation, as well as the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention requirements.  Roche Vitamins has an Emergency Response Plan, and coordinates emergency response activities (procedures, training, drills, etc.) with the adjacent Cytec Industries Inc. facility.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled:  \nThe only processes at the Roche Vitamins facility that are subject to the Risk Management Planning requirements are the two 10,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios:  \nThe worst-case release scenario for the facility is the release of the entire contents of one 10,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia tank in 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is estimated to be 3.7 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a failure of the liquid line used to transfer anhydrous ammonia from tank trucks to storage tanks while material is being transferred.  The distance to the endpoint for the alternative release scenario is estimated to be 0.3 miles.\n\nGeneral Accident Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps:  \nRoche Vitamins has an Accident Prevention Program for the ammonia tanks that includes the following elements:\n\n- Identification of the potential hazards associ"
