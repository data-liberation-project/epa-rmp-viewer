This facility processes wastewater for Turlock and surrounding communities, processing approximately 10.6 million gallons of wastewater per day. The NAICS Code for the facility is 221320 (Sewage Treatment Facilities).\r\n\r\nChlorine (CAS 7782-50-5) is the regulated substance used in the facility's wastewater treatment system. The chlorine system, which is an open system, contains approximately 40,000 pounds of chlorine in ton containers. The system takes liquid chlorine from ton-containers, changes the liquid to a gas in evaporators, and then provides gaseous chlorine to water injectors which mix the gas with water to form a disinfecting agent. The disinfecting agent is piped to various points at the wastewater treatment facility.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nTRWQCF has developed a management system, an emergency action plan, and prevention programs to meet RMP/PSM requirements. The prevention programs cover Process Safety Information, a Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures, a Training program, a Mechanical Integrity Program, Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review programs, Compliance Audit and Incident Investigation programs, an Employee Participation Program a Hot Work Permit Program, and a Contractor Safety Program.\r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. TRWQCF has incorporated many safety features in the chlorine system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with chlorine systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to chlorine expansion. The TRWQCF chlorine system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down ton-c"

Management responses and support will be consistent with TRWQCF's commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations. Changes suggested during the PHA included:\r\n\u00bf\tTo provide a backup system in the event the hoist fails with the ton container attached, management will look into acquiring a manual chain hoist, develop an SOPs, and provide training to operate the equipment.\r\n\r\nTRWQCF recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving chlorine handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as TRWQCF continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. TRWQCF will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with TRWQCF's internal review practices, and TRWQCF will maintain the most current versions on site. Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM and related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."

Program 3 requirements of the RMP/PSM apply to the TRWQCF facility due to the quantity of chlorine used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as ... the greatest amount held in a single vessel ... released as a gas over 10 minutes. An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\r\n\r\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios. These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA but are presented in the RMP/PSM documentation.\r\n\r\n&#8195;\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the 5-year accident history at the regulated facility.

Outside responders will be responsible for Incident Command, notification of other public agencies and the need for shelter-in-place or evacuation notices. The Incident Commander will be responsible for first aid, medical monitoring and personnel decontamination as needed.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nTRWQCF performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) update in 2018 and developed a new list of suggested mitigating measures.

The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2745, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nTRWQCF prepared the RMP/PSM Program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve chlorine handling systems and practices at the facility. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, TRWQCF has written an Emergency Response Program (Emergency Action Plan) and personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the local fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team.
