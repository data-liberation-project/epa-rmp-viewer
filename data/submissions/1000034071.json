      "SummaryText": "Overview:\r\nIn 1970 Leo J. Diamond and William P. Cunningham Sr. founded Astro Chemicals Inc., with one purpose: commitment to the customer. Every order had their personal promise of 100% customer satisfaction. Today, our promise remains the same. Though the world's greater demands for environmental responsibility and business efficiencies create a broader sense of commitment, this challenge has only strengthened our resolve. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nAstro Chemicals' approach to chemical safety starts at the beginning with a New Product / Process Change Review. This includes input by the sales person, purchasing, quality control and the regulatory department to identify the hazards of a product to determine if Astro can safely store, transport, or in some cases repackage for Astros' customer(s).  To move forward Astro will then communicate the requirements to the operations personnel in one of three ways: through a new or existing written procedure, the development of a check list, or verbal instruction.  Managerial over site is provided on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nAstro prevention program is centered on good warehousing practices as mandated by the National Association of Chemical Distributors Responsible Distribution which can be found at http://www.nacd.com/dist_process/National Association of Chemical Distributors \r\n\r\nResponsible Distribution Code of Management Practice \r\nEach member company shall have an active program designed to continuously improve safety and reduce incidents. This Code does not impose upon member companies any obligation to guarantee compliance by third parties, i.e., parties over whom the member companies have no control.
