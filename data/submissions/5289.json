This Risk Management Plan has been developed to \nidentify and document the hazards associated with the storage, handling, and possible release of toxic chlorine gas.  \nThe Water Board receives delivery of approximately 10 1-ton chlorine cylinders every four to five months, and as \nmany as 13 1-ton containers may be stored within the Pony Creek Treatment Plant at any one time.  The EPA \nthreshold quantity for gaseous chlorine applicable to the RMP regulations is 2,500 lbs.  The PCTP exceeds this \nthreshold quantity.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from a Water Board chorine process within the past five years that resulted \nin deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering \nin place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nOff-site consequences analysis was performed for a single worst case chlorine release scenario and a single \nalternative chlorine release scenario.  The area impacted by such releases is shown on Figures 1 and 2 herein.  For \nthe worst case scenario, a chlorine toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm chlorine may develop within a 2.63 mile \nradius of the PCTP.  Public receptors within the impacted area include schools, residences, a hospital, medical centers, public recreational areas including parks, pools, and sports fields, and major commercial, office, and industrial areas buildings.  The affected population for the worst case scenario is estimated at 21,000.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, a chlorine toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm chlorine may develop within 0.60 mile radius of the PCTP.  Public receptors within the impacted area include residences, a hospital, medical centers, and some commercial and office buildings.  The affected population for the alternative release scenario is estimated at 900.\n\nThe prevention program includes the chapter on proce"

All required prevention program elements are \naddressed in this section. \n\nThe Coos Bay - North Bend Water Board has coordinated with the City of Coos Bay Fire Department for response \nto a chlorine release at the PCTP.  The fire department will respond as the Fire and Rescue Hazmat Team.  The \nprimary document describing the response procedures for a chlorine release incident as well as any Water Board \nhazardous material incident is the Coos Bay - North Bend Water Board Hazardous Materials Annex.  Also, the \nWater Board's specific response to a chlorine release is described."
