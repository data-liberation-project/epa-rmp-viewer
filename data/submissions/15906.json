Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility in Sheyenne are strongly\ncommitted to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of\nour comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design,\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes\nat our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\nregulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are\nat hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts\nwith the Eddy County LEPC, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in as 30,000-gallon tank at our facility in Sheyenne (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored is 25,800 gallons (132,766.8 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 86%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (132,766.8 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2).  The estim"

The\nscenario involves the release of 7837.38 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 miles (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of\nthis facility is 12.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nFarmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility maintains a detailed record of safety\ninformation that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs\nassociated with all processes (Appendix E).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFarmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility maintains written operating procedures\nto ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures\naddress various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible\nto operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nFarmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility has a comprehensive training program\nin place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating\nprocedures associated with these processes (Appendix C).\n\nMechanical Integrity\nFarmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility conducts document"

Maintenance checks are conducted by\nqualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment\nthat would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems,\nrelief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment\ndeficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner\n(Appendix D).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Farmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility to\nmanage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators,\nmaintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process\nconditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nFarmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility routinely conducts pre-startup safety\nreviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are\nconducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are\nsuitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nFarmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility conducts compliance audits on a regular\nbasis to determine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being\nimplemented.  Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nFarmers Union Oil Company Sheyenne Ammonia Facility truly believes that process safety\nmanagement and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged\nto express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
