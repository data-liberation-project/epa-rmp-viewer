Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\r\n\r\nThe management and employees of Gold Star FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any\r\naccidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared\r\nto work with the local Fire Department, Local Emergency Planning Committee or\r\nother authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to\r\nfarmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop\r\nproduction nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tank(s), loading risers,\r\nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees,\r\nauthorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\r\n\r\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes\r\nand regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association's\r\n(CGA's) American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\r\nAmmonia (6th edition), commonly referred to as ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014, as adopted by state regulation\r\nand the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\r\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training\r\nof our employees make up our accident release prevention progr"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\r\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\r\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property\r\ndamage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program.\r\n\r\nThis facility is a non-responding facility. The facility has:\r\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\r\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information\r\nas required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Fire\r\nDepartment and LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency\r\naction plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to\r\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for\r\nimplementation at this time."
