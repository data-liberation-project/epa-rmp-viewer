Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThis facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan has been provided to the local LEPC for review. \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\n\n\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole. As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program.

These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as SDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe\n\noperating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the \"What-if\" technique. This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log. \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location,equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\n\n\n\nTrain"

The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems. This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition. These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. \n\n\n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas). Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met.

Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed.

However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community. The SARSC Frozen Combo chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The SARSC Frozen Combo complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR). The operators of the systems are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SARSC Frozen Combo has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies. The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan. The plan requires employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area. The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency. The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors. Maintenance personnel will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency. The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages. This location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years. The SARSC Frozen Combo wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. An updated Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system on August 25, 2015. Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Release Preventio"
