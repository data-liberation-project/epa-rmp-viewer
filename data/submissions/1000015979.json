      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nFlavor Right Foods Group, Inc. desires to operate its ammonia refrigeration system without negative incidents that will affect its operation and surrounding community.  The company will achieve this by ensuring the system design is by relevant standards and codes, and operated and maintained by competent service professionals or company personnel.\n\nTo help prevent and mitigate the results of negative incidents Flavor Right implemented results of mechanical integrity studies, process hazard analysis, local fire department involvement, and installation by a licensed contractor.  However, the Flavor Right site incorporated specific emergency response actions into emergency action plans to account for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The company referenced the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for developing actions in case of a negative incident, and documented emergency response actions on the exterior of the ammonia refrigeration building, within the process safety management program, and within emergency response checklists.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Used\n\nFlavor Right Foods Group, Inc. occupies a warehouse type building for cold storage.  The company stores concentrates and flavorings for desert fillings and toppings.  Flavor Right uses an ammonia refrigeration system to maintain a cold dock, cooler, and freezer for receiving, storing, and shipping the food products.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system operates with approximately 13,500 pounds of ammonia, anhydrous.  If a system operates at greater than 10,000 pounds, a company is responsible for developing a Process Safety Management program under OSHA and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  These programs and plans help a company manage their risk of exposure to internal employees and the community.\n\nThe ammonia refrige"

The process is such that the ammonia simply changes physical state between a gas and liquid to effectively cool spaces.  There are not air emissions or water discharges from the process if the system when the system is operated and maintained appropriately.\n \nGeneral Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system received updates in accordance with current codes and standards in 2010.  The local fire department conducted several inspections during the 2010 update process to ensure the company engineered appropriate safeguards into the system.  A professional engineer specializing in ammonia refrigeration systems completed a complete mechanical integrity study on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nNew instrumentation controls and monitors the ammonia refrigeration system.  The company updated the ammonia refrigeration system with ammonia detection systems, including visual/audible alarms.  All equipment pressure-relief valves are new installed 2010.  The company utilizes a continuous flow ventilation fan.  Emergency exhaust ventilation is available for emergency events.\n\nProcess equipment operates within design limits and is in good clean condition.  There is not excessive dirt, scale, or ice built up around the system.  The company secured equipment so it does not exhibit excessive vibration.\n\nAdministrative controls such as a Process Safety Management Program and Operating Procedures are in place to help prevent and mitigate releases.  OSHA defines required Process Safety Management information and includes items like:\nA?    Gathering and communicating process chemical information\nA?    Documenting process technology information\nA?    Documenting process equipment information\nA?    Conducting process hazard analysis\nA?    Ensuring and maintaining mechanical integrity of the system\nA?    Developing and following operating procedures\nA?    Conducting pre-startup review\nA?    Process change management\nA?    Co"

Training with proven competence\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe previous owner of the ammonia refrigeration system experienced a negative incident requiring the local fire department to respond.  The Flavor Right is not aware of additional factual data regarding the incident.\n\nFlavor Right made significant improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system.  The company has no incidents to report since they assumed ownership.\n\nElements of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThe key elements to the company's emergency response program are:\nA?    Emergency instructions, phone numbers, and direct contacts posted on the exterior of the ammonia refrigeration building.\nA?    Emergency Phone List incorporated into the PSM program listing Flavor Right emergency contacts, service contractor contacts, utility contacts, and local hospitals and occupational healthcare centers.\nA?    Emergency Response Checklists describing evacuation and dealing with several common emergency events.\nA?    The company designed the ammonia refrigeration system to shut down in the event that the ammonia detection system activates, and the system will activate emergency exhaust, and notify the local fire department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFlavor Right implemented several upgrades to the ammonia refrigeration system in 2010.  The company implemented critical findings discovered during the mechanical integrity study and process hazard analysis.  Flavor right will continue to consider and/or implement additional findings to improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n"
