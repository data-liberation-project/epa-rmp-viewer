The company will achieve this by ensuring the system design is by relevant standards and codes, and operated and maintained by competent service professionals or company personnel.\n\nTo help prevent and mitigate the results of negative incidents Flavor Right implemented results of mechanical integrity studies, process hazard analysis, local fire department involvement, and installation by a licensed contractor.  However, the Flavor Right site incorporated specific emergency response actions into emergency action plans to account for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The company referenced the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for developing actions in case of a negative incident, and documented emergency response actions on the exterior of the ammonia refrigeration building, within the process safety management program, and within emergency response checklists.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Used\n\nFlavor Right Foods Group, Inc. occupies a warehouse type building for cold storage.  The company stores concentrates and flavorings for desert fillings and toppings.  Flavor Right uses an ammonia refrigeration system to maintain a cold dock, cooler, and freezer for receiving, storing, and shipping the food products.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system operates with approximately 13,500 pounds of ammonia, anhydrous.  If a system operates at greater than 10,000 pounds, a company is responsible for developing a Process Safety Management program under OSHA and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  These programs and plans help a company manage their risk of exposure to internal employees and the community.\n\nThe ammonia refrige"

The process is such that the ammonia simply changes physical state between a gas and liquid to effectively cool spaces.  There are not air emissions or water discharges from the process if the system when the system is operated and maintained appropriately.\n \nGeneral Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system received updates in accordance with current codes and standards in 2010.  The local fire department conducted several inspections during the 2010 update process to ensure the company engineered appropriate safeguards into the system.  A professional engineer specializing in ammonia refrigeration systems completed a complete mechanical integrity study on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nNew instrumentation controls and monitors the ammonia refrigeration system.  The company updated the ammonia refrigeration system with ammonia detection systems, including visual/audible alarms.  All equipment pressure-relief valves are new installed 2010.  The company utilizes a continuous flow ventilation fan.  Emergency exhaust ventilation is available for emergency events.\n\nProcess equipment operates within design limits and is in good clean condition.  There is not excessive dirt, scale, or ice built up around the system.  The company secured equipment so it does not exhibit excessive vibration.\n\nAdministrative controls such as a Process Safety Management Program and Operating Procedures are in place to help prevent and mitigate releases.  OSHA defines required Process Safety Management information and includes items like:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tGathering and communicating process chemical information\n\u00c2\u00bf\tDocumenting process technology information\n\u00c2\u00bf\tDocumenting process equipment information\n\u00c2\u00bf\tConducting process hazard analysis\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEnsuring and maintaining mechanical integrity of the system\n\u00c2\u00bf\tDeveloping and following operating procedures\n\u00c2\u00bf\tConducting pre-startup review\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess change management\n\u00c2\u00bf\tCo"
