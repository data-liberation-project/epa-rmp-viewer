This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive Process Hazard Management Program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing of sulfuric acid and the regeneration of spent sulfuric acid..  We have 2 regulated substance that could be present at our facility Ammonia (anhydrous) and Ethyl Mercaptan.   Ammonia is used to reduce emissions from the sulfuric acid plant.  Ethyl Mercaptan is part of a mixture that is used as a feed stock to recover sulfur to make sulfuric acid.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 175,000 lb.  The maximum inventory of Ethyl Mercaptan is 160,000 lb. \n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the ammonia storage tank at the facility.  In this scenario 175000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form"

The released quantity has been limited to 80 % of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls .  This release does have an impact outside the facility and in the community.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from an unloading hose.    The scenario involves the release of 300 lb. of toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of minimizing the duration of the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.1 miles.  This would not have an impact on the community.\n\tThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Baytown Acid Plant.  In this scenario 160,000 lb. of Ethyl mercaptan is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. The impact corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would not effect the community.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Baytown Acid Plant.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 160000 lb. of Ethyl mercaptan [Ethanethiol].   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.25 miles and would not effect the community.\n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nRhodia Baytown Facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/01/1997.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Rhodia Baytown Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nRhodia Baytown Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nRhodia Baytown Facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Rhodia Baytown Facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 12/01/1998.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Rhodia Baytown Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nRhodia Baytown Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 10/14/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nRhodia Baytown Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Al"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Rhodia Baytown Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nRhodia Baytown Facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nRhodia Baytown Facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
