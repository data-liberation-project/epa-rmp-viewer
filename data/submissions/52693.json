The site follows the DuPont Corporate philosophy that the ?goal is zero?, which constantly strives for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  Site programs, procedures and management practices are in place to support this goal of zero.  Our progress is constantly assessed against this goal of zero and corrective actions are taken whenever necessary.\n\nAlthough the primary focus of the facility is on accidental release prevention, the site also possesses and maintains a strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  The combination of prevention programs and emergency response capabilities is used to ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as, the protection of the environment.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by New Jersey?s Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) Risk Management Program regulation;\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases;\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- A five-year history of accidental release of chemicals regulated by the TCPA rule;\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DuPont Chambers Works facility first opened in the early 1900?s as a dye manufacturing plant.

Several unique types of rubber, greases and oils are also produced on site to meet the special needs of other manufacturing industries.\n\nThe following chemicals that TCPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release are utilized at the Chambers Works facility:\n\nToxics:\nAmmonia\nBromine\nChlorine\nEthylene Oxide\nHexafluoroacetone (NJ only chemical)\nHydrogen Chloride\nHydrochloric Acid greater than 70% strength (NJ only chemical)\nNitric Acid greater than 80% strength\nOleum\nPhosgene\nTitanium Tetrachloride\n\nFlammables:\nVinylidene Chloride\nEthylene\n\nReactives (NJ only chemicals):\nEthylene Oxide\n1,2 ? Dinitrobenzene\n1,3 ? Dinitrobenzene\n1,4 ? Dinitrobenzene\n\nKey Off-site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nTo help with understanding the potential impact on the community due to a release of chemicals from DuPont Chambers Works, information is provided about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for the Chambers Works facility.\n\nThese scenarios were developed using the guidance and technical data supplied by the EPA.  Scenario information similar to that described below has been used on Chambers Works for many years as part of our process safety management program.  In the past we have modeled potential releases and analyzed the results to help the site continuously improve processes and reduce risk.  The site continues to conduct these assessments as part of internal process safety management systems.\n\nThe EPA defines the worst case scenario as a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical.  The scenario assumes the entire quantity is released in ten minutes, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\nUsing the methods described by the EPA, the worst case release of a flammable chemical from Chambers wo"

The scenario assumes the cloud would ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the released material.  The pressure wave generated from the explosion would barely leave the site boundary.  This event would not be expected to expose the public to a significant hazard (the amount of pressure of concern to the EPA or NJ), but an explosion like this would be heard and possibly felt off the Chambers Works site.\n\nAlso using the methods described by the EPA, the worst case toxic scenario is the release of the entire contents of a chlorine railcar in a 10-minute period.  Using EPA guidelines, a release like this could significantly impact the public off the Chambers Works site, depending on the wind direction at the time of release.\n\nThe worst case scenarios described above underscore the need for very rigorous process safety management systems.  It is important to note that none of the prevention and mitigation equipment, practices, and procedures in place at the facility to prevent or respond to these releases are taken into account for these worst case scenarios.\n\nIn order to facilitate emergency response planning with the community, TCPA and the EPA have included the requirement for companies to report alternate care scenarios.  These alternate case scenarios provide a realistic picture of what could actually happen if the safety systems used by a facility were to fail.\n\nTCPA requires that companies include one alternate release scenario for regulated flammables as a group and one of each regulated toxic chemical.  This is because the impact of a flammable scenario on the public is expected to be similar for all the different types of flammables.  The toxic chemicals can vary in their effects and so must be reviewed individually.  In the data elements section of this report you will find a detailed description of all these alternate release scenarios.\n\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e alternate case for flammables on Chambers Works is the complete, catastrophic failure of an unloading flex hoses while transferring vinylidene chloride to the storage tank.  In this scenario, vinylidene chloride is released and ignited, resulting in a flash fire.  This alternate scenario does not extend off-site or impact the public.  Of course, we still have accident prevention activates in place to protect our employees from injury.\n\nOnly one alternate case scenario for toxic chemicals on Chambers works extend off-site and could potentially impact the local community depending on the wind direction at the time of release.  The scenario is a pipe leak of nitric acid (conc. 80% or greater) that may extend .84 miles from the point of release.  The other alternative scenarios may reach beyond the site boundary but the endpoint distances do not reach populated areas.  Emergency procedures and mitigation equipment are in place to prevent and respond, as needed, to these scenarios.\n\nIn addition to release prevention measures, the site maintains a highly trained and equipped emergency response department around the clock.  They are able to respond to any chemical release and mitigate the impact.  To address a situation like the alternate scenarios described above, Chambers Works has an emergency response and fire truck equipped with chemical resistant foam.  This foam can be sprayed over the spill and smother the fume release.\n\nThe next section contains more information about out release prevention activities.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nFor many years, employees at DuPont Chambers works have applied rigorous process safety management practices to all our processes, not just those covered by regulations.

The emergency responders are thoroughly trained and properly equipped to respond to a release of any chemical used on the site.  The site also maintains an emergency response brigade comprised of specially trained operators that can lend additional support as necessary.\n\nChambers works conducts practice drills with the local community and emergency response organizations.  These drills simulate potential accidental release and test emergency response plans.  Chambers Works also supports a siren system in the local community that would provide early warning for a potential release.  This system is coordinated with the Salem County Office of Emergency Response.\n\nIn addition to these on-site activities, Chambers works also maintains transportation emergency response capability, which allows the site to respond to chemical transportation incidents outside the Chambers Works site.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents in the past 5 years that meet the criteria for reporting in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improv"
