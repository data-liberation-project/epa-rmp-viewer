No substantial changes have taken place since the initial submission. The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The Cypress Bend Mill does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility similar to the Cypress Bend Mill and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by the Cypress Bend Mill.

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is 11 miles.  The U.S. Census indicates that less than 30 people live within the distance from the mill.  There are two public receptors within this distance, DeSoto Landing on the Mississippi River and Bunge Corporation Grain Terminal.   There are no environmental receptors within this distance.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a 4 inch Chlorine dioxide solution (1 wt %) transfer line from the storage tank to a bleach plant mixer.  This scenario assumes that the solution is pumped through a severed line at 180 gallons per minute, and workers require 20 minutes to detect the release and stop the transfer pumps.  The released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.9 miles.  The U. S. Census indicates that less than 20 people live within this distance from the mill.  The Bunge Corporation Grain Terminal and the Mississippi River are public receptors within this distance.\n\n1.3.2  Water Treatment Chlorine Storage and Transfer (1 ton cylinders)\n\nThe worst-case scenario reported for one (1) ton chlorine cylinders is the loss of the entire contents of a one ton cylinder in one hour or 35 pounds per minute.

Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer, the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer, and the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes. In September 2000, chlorine for pulp bleaching and anhydrous ammonia was removed from service and is no longer present at the site.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Cypress Bend Mill?s Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.  \n\n1.

One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Cypress Bend Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Cypress Bend.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Cypress Bend Mill.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at the Cypress Bend Mill consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.6\n\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\n\n\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\n\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Potlatch Corporation helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.  In fact, the Cypress Bend Mill has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nThe Cypress Bend Mill prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.

Potlatch Corporation trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  \n\n\n\nThe safety program at the Cypress Bend Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of that are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Potlatch Corporation that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nPotlatch Corporation is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Cypress Bend Mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes in the mill; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Cypress Bend Mill.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Cypress Bend Mill controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  The mill provides response training to its employees and designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities.  The Cypress Bend Emergency Responders group is staffed with approximately 50 employees.\n\n\n\n1.2 Facility Information and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Arkansas Pulp and Paperboard Division of Potlatch Corporation operates an integrated bleached kraft mill that employs approximately 325 full-time workers.

No substantial changes have taken place since the initial submission. The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The Cypress Bend Mill does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility similar to the Cypress Bend Mill and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by the Cypress Bend Mill.  These requirements are:\n\n\n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide generation, storage, and transfer. \n\n* One worst case and one alternative release scenario for chlorine water treatment\n\n\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Cypress Bend Mill.\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for toxic substances is the catastrophic rupture of a 28,750-gallon tank.

This scenario assumes that the solution is pumped through a severed line at 180 gallons per minute, and workers require 20 minutes to detect the release and stop the transfer pumps.  The released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.9 miles.  The U. S.

Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer, the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer, and the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes. In September 2000, chlorine for pulp bleaching and anhydrous ammonia was removed from service and is no longer present at the site.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Cypress Bend Mill?s Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.  \n\n\n\n1.    Process Safety Information.  Potlatch Corporation maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the mill processes.  These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Cypress Bend Mill, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment in the mill.  The Cypress Bend Mill ensures that this process safety information is available to all Potlatch employees and local fire and emergency response personnel.\n\n\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Cypress Bend Mill, including regulated substances in RMP-covered processes.

All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7. Pre-startup Review.  The Cypress Bend Mill performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\n\n\n\n* construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\n* adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n\n* employee training has been completed\n\n* for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\n\n\nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n\n\n8.

Chlorine is supplied in one ton cylinders for use in water treatment in various areas of the mill.  \n\n\n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Cypress Bend Mill and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a 1 % or less by weight chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A curbed area around the storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Cypress Bend Mill has had no releases during the last five years while handling chlorine or chlorine dioxide that have resulted in any offsite public or environmental effects.
