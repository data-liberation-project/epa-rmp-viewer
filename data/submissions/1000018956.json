This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe & Operating Limits Document.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures, trained personnel, and regulated inspection frequencies, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Tesoro Anacortes Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Tesoro Anacortes Refinery uses a combination of the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique and a Checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who ha"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Tesoro Anacortes Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\nThe Tesoro Anacortes Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operation, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

The procedures are also re-certified every 3 years.\n\nIn addition, the Tesoro Anacortes Refinery maintains a Safe & Operating Limits Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Tesoro Anacortes Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage its consequences, no credit for passive nor active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ARS. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for communicating the potential hazards of our operations with the local community and improving emergency planning and response programs.\n\nThe Tesoro Anacortes Refinery is not required under the RMP regulation to report a Toxic WCS nor Toxic ARS scenario because there are no RMP regulated toxic substances stored at our facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity.  However, the following toxic RMP substances are present at our facility, stored below the RMP threshold quantity: hydrogen sulfide and anhydrous ammonia. Although we are not required to evaluate the effects of a toxic release under the RMP regulation, we went ahead and evaluated imaginary scenarios to better understand the potential affects an accidental, toxic release might have on our community. This information, along with other RMP information, has been shared with our community and local responders through meetings and brochure publications.\n \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n4/2/10 at 12:30 am a heat exchanger in the Naphtha Hydro Treating unit catastrophically failed causing a subsequent release and fire and seven Tesoro employees suffered fatal injuries.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tesoro Anacortes Refinery, located in Anacortes, Washington, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline, jet, diesel, and residual fuels) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, pentane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Tesoro Anacortes Refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing an RMP regulated flammable mixture. The full tank inventory was assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.   Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE involving the full inventory of a butane railcar (n-butane). No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the railcar; therefore, the full"
