              "Description": "Section 2-Process Safety Information\n\nI.  Introduction\n\nA.  In conjunction with the Process Hazard Assessment (Section 3 of the Program), we have completed a compilation of written process safety information in order to enable our supervisory personnel and our employees who operate the processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.  This safety information will be made readily available to those involved in the processes, and includes but is not limited to: 1. Information pertaining to hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used in the process, and 2. Information pertaining to the technology of the process.\n\nB.  Further details on chlorine information follows:\n\nHazard Category                        Chlorine\nToxicity information                     Non-carcinogenic\nPermissible exposure limits, ppm  1\nPhysical data                              Greenish-yellow gas\nCorrosivity data                            Most metals corrode \nReactivity data                             Poison gas\nThermal & Chemical stability data  Stable under normal condition\nHazardous effects of inadverttent    Chemicals to be avoided include\nmixing of different materials that     hydrocarbons, ammonia, ether,\ncould foreseeably occur.                hydrogen,acetylene,turpentine,\n                                                    powdered metals and other \n                                                    reducing agents.\n\n1. Hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used in the process. This information consist of the following:\nProcess Variables\n                                                                Chlorine\nMinimum Temperature (F)                                55\nMaximum Flowrate (ppd)                                 100\nMaximum Inductor Pressure (psi)                     150\nMinimum Inductor Pressure (psi)                       30\nVacuum (in Hg)                                                10\n\nC.  We have ascertained that our equipment complies with applicable codes and standards, such as those published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American National standard Institue, the American Society of Testing and Materials, and the National Fire Protection Association, where they exist; or, with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nII.  Chlorination Process\n\nA.  Process Chemistry \n\nChlorine is used to disinfect the water effluent prior to discharging into the water supply system.  Chlorination capacities are generally selected to meet the specific design criteria of the state or other regulatory agencies controlling the water supply system.  In any case, the residual in the effluent is determined by onsite testing.  Ammonia is not added to the water immediately after chlorination at this site.\n\nThe general chlorination equations are as follows: Cl2 + H2O<->HOCL+H+Cl\n\nFree residual chlorine is readily obtained with waters of low chlorine demand.  The maintenance of a residual of free chlorine with a Water Treatment plant minimizes the growth of microorganisms and slimes on sand filters and in settling basins.  Free chlorine facilitates the oxidation and removal of inorganic reducing agents and sometimes improves the coagulation behavior of certain waters.\nThe useful functions of chlorine residuals are: 1.  Control of algae and bacterial aftergrowth, 2.  Reduction of dead end red water problems in the distribution systems; and 3.  Bactericidal protection of drinking water from recontamination.\n\nB.  Maximum Inventory\n\nChlorine is supplied as liquefied gas under high pressure from one ton container with on additional one ton container online in standby mode.  The maximum inventory for chlorine is eight 1-ton containers or 16,000 pounds.  Equipment manuals, which component specifications, operating parameters, and maintenance procedures, may be found in Appendix B.\n\nC. Process\n\nThe chlorination system includes the chlorine supply, chlorinators, and injectors.  The chlorine injector is the controlling component.  The injector is used to create a vacuum that is used to draw the chlorine gas from the chlorine container through the chlorinator, and into the injector.  The chlorinator meters the volume of chlorine solution at the injector, the chlorine dissolves in the injector water supply to form hypochlorous acid.  From the injector, the hypochlorous acid solution flows to the chlorinator (the measuring device) may be held constant or varied in accordance with the flow by changing the degree of vacuum.  Chlorine dioxide is used as a pretreatment.  It is made on an as needed basis with no storage.\n\nD. Consequences of Deviation\n\nIf the system is operated beyond the design and operational parameters, the following events may occur. Parameter are Temperature (T), Pressure (P), Flowrate (FR),  Condition are Low (L), High (H).\n\nParameter    Condition    Effect \n      T                 L          Vapors reliquify & damage equipment\n      T                 H          Pressure buildup in system could cause a\n                                     release.\n      P                 L          Inaccurate metering of chemicals-could \n                                     exceed permit requirements for residuals\n                                     concentrations.\n      P                 H          Pressure buildup in system could cause \n                                      release\n      FR               L          Not meet permit requirements for residual\n                                     concentrations.\n      FR               H         Could exceed permit requirements for \n                                     residuals concentrations.  \n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) For\n\nRMP REGULATED COMPOUNDS: Chlorine\n\nA copy of the MSDS for all the chemicals at the WTP may be found in the MSDS notebook located in the operation room.",

              "Description": "Section 3-Process Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n\nThe PHA includes the offsite consequence analysis, PHA, and the 5-year accident history.\n\nI.  OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA)\n\nA.  The OCA includes a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.  A dense gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to estimate the end point distances for both scenarios.  A dense gas model is required since chlorine is heavier than air.  The model's input parameters are summarized below:  \n\nSLAB Input Parameters\n                                         Worst Case Scenario   Alter. Scenario\nEnd Point Conc.

Worst Case Release Scenario Analysis\n\n1. An analysis of one worst case release scenario was conducted to estimate the greatest distance from a point of release to the end point for chlorine.\n2. A worst case release quantity is predetermined as the greatest amount held is a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that would be released in the event of an accident.  The maximum quantity for chlorine is a 2000 pound (1 ton) instantaneuous release of gas over a 10 minute period.\n3. The chlorine containers are in an open area, which does not provide passive mitigation\n\nC.  Alternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\n1. The alternative release scenario was determined from the results of the Process Hazard Review and from the review of historical accident data.\n2. The most likely accident to occur is a disconnection of the flex hose that connects the containers to the header line.\n3. The release duration was assumed to be 10 minute jet release of gas and liquid.\nThe results of the air dispersion model are summarized in the table below with the estimated population within the impact area.  The population data was estimated using the Block Uniform Density Group Method in the Landview III computer program.\n\nII.  5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last 5 years, there have not been accidental release from the covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nIII. PROCESS HAZARD REVIEW\n\nA Process Hazard Review was conducted to identify the following:\n\n* The hazards associated with chlorine processes;\n* Opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error that could cause a release;\n* Safeguards that will control the hazards or prevent the malfunction or error; and\n* Steps to detect or monitor releases.\n\nA What-if and checklist analysis was used to conduct the review.  The review team utilized the What-if Analysis technique to brainstorm the various types of accidents that could occur within the chlorine systems.  Then the team used one or more checklists to help fill in any gaps that were missed.\n\nSLAB OUTPUT PARAMETERS\n                                          Worst Case Scenario   Alt.

              "Description": "SECTION 8-EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nEMERGENCY CONTACT NUMBERS\n\nDIAL 911 for all emergencies and request assistance from the fire department.  The dispatcher will then notify the fire department and police.  If a person needs medical attention, request emergency medical treatment personnel.  Then call one of the LEPC coordinators listed below.\n\nWTP LEPC Numbers-Charlie Montgomery, Emergency Mgr Coordinator, (956)318-2600(work) or 911(24 hrs).\n\nPHARR FIRE DEPARTMENT\nCalling 911 would contacted them.  The FD is the first responder to an emergency.\n\nOUTSIDE SERVICES (to be contacted only in event of a RQ release)\nNational Repsonse Center 1-800-424-8802\nCHEMTREC  1-800-424-9300\n\nRegulated Substance-chlorine, Reportable Quantity (RQ)- 10 lbs\n\nI. PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\nThe City of Pharr has developed this written Emergency Repsonse Plan for the WTP to provide guidance for responding to accidental releases of chlorine. The plan was developed in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68, Subpart E. Emergency response procedures are necessary because accidents can occur, even with the best safety programs in place. Emergency reponse is to be undertaken to reduce the severity of a release and protect employees, emergency responders, and the public from harmful exposure to chlorine.\n\nA. APPPLICATION\n\nThe WTP is subject to the Clean Air Act's RMP regulations, which require emergency response actions including public notification, emergency training to respond to an offsite release of chlorine. The EPA risk management regulations require that at a minimum, plans must be developed for notifying offsite responders and providing first aid(for facilities that will not respond with its employees); for community notification and coordination with the community response plan; for using, maintaining, and testing emergency response systems and equipment; and employee training.\n\nThe ERP shall include the following elements:\n\n* Emergency escape procedures & escape route assignments\n* Procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate\n* Procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed\n* Rescue & medical duties for those employees who are to perform them\n* Preferred means of reporting fires & other emegencies\n* Names & regular job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information of duties under the plan\n* An emergency alarm system shall be established\n* The types of evacuation to be used in emergency circumstances shall be established in the emergency plan\n* Training of employees to assist in the safe and orderly emergency evacuation of employees.\n\nThe ERP developed herein shall be coordinated with the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC 11003.  Upon request by the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) or emergency reponse officials, WTP shall promptly provide to the local emergency response officials, information necessary for developing and implementing the community response plan.\n\nB. EXEMPTIONS\n\nThe contents of this emergency response program apply to the entire WTP, although it is primarily intended to address a release of chlorine the WTP's chlorination processes.  Chlorine is the only regulated substance in the water treatment process that is present above threshold quantities.\n\nThis emergency reponse program does not include responses to incidental releases of regulated substances, including chlorine, where the substances can be \"absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area.\n\nII. REFERENCES\n\nThe listing is not intended to be exhaustive and the reader is referred to 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910 for a more complete regulatory listing.\n\nA.

Documents\n    1. Risk Management Program for the WTP\n    2. The Chlorine Manual-The Chlorine Institute\n\nIII. REPORTING\n\nA. PROCEDURES\n\nIn the event that there is a fire or a release of chlorine, the person(s) discovering the fire or release is to immediately report the incident to the Operation Manager or person designated in his palce.  If the emergency is critical call 911 before calling the Operation Manager.  The Operation Manager will call the LEPC if necessary and determine if a reportable quantity (RQ) release has occurred.  The LEPC will notify other appropriate contacts, as they deem necessary: \n\nInformation to be reported to emergency responders should include the following (upon calling 911): chemical released, estimated quantity released, time and duration of the release, evacuation and/or sheltering plans, name and telephone number of the person(s) to be contacted for further information.\n\nIV. EMERGENCY EVACUATION\n\nA. EMERGENCY ALARM SYSTEM\n\nIf a release of chlorine occurs, the chlorine sensor will sound an audible alarm and activate the strobe light on top of the building.  A signal is also sent to the main building.  THERE ARE NO OTHER AUDIBLE OR VISUAL ALARMS AT THE PLANT THAT WILL SIGNAL THAT A CHLORINE RELEASE HAS OCCURRED.\n\nA windsock, located close to the chlorine area, indicates wind direction.  All employees should note the wind direction and move up-wind or crosswind to a release of chlorine.\n\nB. TYPES OF EVACUATION\n\nIn the event of a release, employees will either be required to evacuate the plant or be sheltered in place.  This will be dependent upon wind direction, severity of the release, and in what part of the plant the release has occurred.\n\nC. EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND SHELTERING\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Operation Manager or his designee will determine if employees will need to evacuate the plant or be sheltered in place.  If evacuation is necessary, employees will be directed to report to one of the three following fence lines: North, East or West\nEvacuation to these locations will be dependent upon wind direction and where a release has occurred. Evacuation routes to these locations have been posted at locations throughout the plant.  Employees will not be allowed to return to the plant until they have been directed to do so by the Operations Manager or one of his designates.\n\nIf sheltering in place is necessary, employees will be directed to report to the following location: Operation Building\n\nEmployees are to remain in the Operation Building until emgency response crew have determined it is safe to leave.\n\nD. COMMUNICATION\n\nDirections to either evacuate the plant or move to the designated sheltering in place location will be broadcast by two-way radio.\n\nE. ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEES\n\nIf evacuation from the plant or sheltering in place becomes necessary, the Operation Manager will account for employees by making a head count from the plant's employee work list and contractor list.\n\nF. CRITICAL PLANT OPERATIONS PROCEDURES\n\nPrior to evacuation from the plantand/or sheltering in place, the chief plant operator and plant operator will each don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and self contained breathing apparatus(SCBA) as necessary. The Chief Plant Operator and Plant Operator willshut down system as necessary.\n\nIf evacuation of the plant has been ordered, above personnel will report to the designated evacuation location once emergency shutdown has been completed.  If sheltering in place has been ordered, the above personnel will remain in operations.\n\nG. OFF-SITE EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nIn the event that a release of chlorine threatens or actually moves off-site, the fire department will be responsible for communicating and notifying affected off-site populations about what actions to take.\n\nV. RESCUE AND MEDICAL DUTIES\n\nA. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe WTP has elected to be a non-responding facility.  Therefore, trained personnel with the Fire Department or EMS will perform any rescue or medical duties.\n\nAnother WTP employee must accompany any plant employee that is sent to the hospital during an emergency.  If possible an MSDS or a copy of medical procedures for treament of exposure to chlorine should accompany the injured employee to the hospital.  This will be helpful to medical personnel who will treat the injured employee(s).\n\nVI. TRAINING\n\nA. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nEach WTP employee should receive orientation training regarding the facility's emergency reponse program.  Refresher training should be presented at least annually and at a minumum cover the following elements: discussion of the ERP, roles and reponsibilities of each employee, checklist for action to be taken, telephone list updates, first aid and cpr training, chlorine hazards, do's and don'ts during an emergency, emergency response and safety equipment, diagram showing evacuation routes and sheltering location(s).\n\nWTP personnel will perform periodic drills to test the participant's reactions and effectiveness in emplementing the ERP. Full scale emergency drills will be conducted at discretion of the Fire Dept.  These drills will include involvement of outside emergency response crews, plant personnel and management. Periodic in plant drills will also be conducted using different release events, and involve as many plant perosnnel as possible.\n\nVII. PLAN REVIEW AND MODIFICATION \n\nThe ERP will be reviewed annually or when a significant process and safety change takes place, also the plan will modified as needed.\n\nVIII. DOCUMENTATION\n\nCopies of the following documents will be maintained with RMP: incident reports, incident training reports, training records, and audit results\n\nIX. RECEPTORS\n\nLandview III was used to identify the public and environmental receptors.  They are:\n\n1.
