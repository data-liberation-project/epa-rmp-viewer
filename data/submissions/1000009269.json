Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release). This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City of Pharr Fire Department is the first responder.\n\nThe emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine, where the substances can be \"adsorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area.\n\nThe City of Pharr has taken steps to train the operators and supervisors to be knowledge in the emergency response program.  The training includes classroom and hands on training on the proper use of emergency response equipment and procedures.  Above all, all employees know where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a release occur.\n\nStationary Source & Regulated Substances\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection.  The maximum inventory and threshold quatity for Chlorine is: Maximum Inventory (lbs) 16,000             Threshold Quantity (lbs) 2,500.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes a worst case release scenario and an alternati"
