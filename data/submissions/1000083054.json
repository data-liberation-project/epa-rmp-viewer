It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Dayton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We do not maintain a fire brigade but do maintain fire response equipment such as hand held fire extinguishers for small fires.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Nokian Tyres (Nokian) facility, located at 520 Nokian Tyres Drive, Dayton Tennessee, is operated as a tire manufacturing facility.  Nokian manufactures passenger car tires and small truck tires.  The facility operates one 12,000 gallon propane tank which is used as a back-up fuel source for the boilers on site. The operational intent is to limit the filling of this tank to 85% of tank capacity.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenario:  Our proposed worst-case scenario is failure of one 12,000-gallon propane storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint (0.3 miles).  Two alternative release scenarios are included in this Risk Management Program, one of which appears to be the actual worst-case scenario .  The first scenario depicts a pull-away explosion resulting in a rupture of a 2-inch diameter hose with a 1 psi overpressure, leading to a 5-minute release and explosion.  Approximately 2,050 pounds/ minute of propane, totaling 20,500 pounds, would be released.  The resulting distance to the endpoint is 407 yards (approximately 0.2 miles) from the source and extends offsite.  According to 2010 U.S Census Data no residential areas are present within this distance however, approximately 2 commercial/ industrial "
