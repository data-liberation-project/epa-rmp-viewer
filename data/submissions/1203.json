THE POTENTIAL QUANTITY RELEASE COULD BE 28,000 LBS., WHICH IS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST TANK AT 85% - AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AS WELL AS COMPANY POLICY. DISTANCE TO END POINT IS 1.19  MILES FROM THIS PLANT.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIO BASED ON INDUSTRY INFORMATION COULD BE A RELEASE FROM A PIPE OR TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO END POINT FOR THIS IS .83 MILES.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN NO RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST 5 YEARS RESULTING IN ANY INJURIES, DEATH, EVACUATION, SHELTERING IN PLACE, OR OTHER EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.\nOUR EMERGENCY PLAN IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE RISKS TO EMPLOYEES, THE SURROUNDING PUBLIC, AS WELL AS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.
