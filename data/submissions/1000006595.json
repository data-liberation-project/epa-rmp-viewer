The raw water source is from the Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation, a jointly owned municipal authority with the City of Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nThe raw water is taken from Lake Huron by the authority at its Whitestone Pumping Facility, near AuGres, Michigan.  The only treatment given the water at the Whitestone facility prior to pumping the water to the two cities is the addition of chlorine.  The purpose of the chlorination is for disinfection of bacteria, controlling tastes and odors, and controlling fouling of the pumps and pipelines. The initial chlorination point is at the Whitestone Pumping Facility.\n\nUpon arrival of the chlorinated raw water at the Midland Water Plant, it undergoes conventional chemical and physical water treatment processes to make it into a safe and desirable public water supply.  Additional chlorine must be added at the Midland Water Treatment Plant to ensure the water meets drinking water quality standards as delivered to the consumers. The maximum inventory of liquid chlorine at the water plant is 8 one-ton containers.\n\nThe Midland Water Plant is located on the east side of Midland approximately 1 1/2 miles inside the city limits. Midland has a population of 41,685.  Its major industry is the Dow Chemical Company.  The water plant operates continuously with total of 14 full time operator, maintenance, laboratory, clerical and supervisory staff.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY-\n\nThe Midland Water Plant has operated continuously for more than fifty-five years without a serious chemical release incident.  The facility has had no reportable off-site toxic chemical releases in the past five years.\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROG"

      "SummaryText": "RAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS-\n\nThe Midland Water Plant has had an ongoing safety program in compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations of OSHA.  A consultant was engaged to assist the water plant's limited staff with the implementation of the RMProgram.  The Risk Management Program guidance manual published by the American Water Works Association Research Foundation was used as a primary reference.  Other informational materials and manuals from USEPA supplemented it.  The water plant management determined that the chlorination process came under Program 3 of the regulation.\n\nA six person RMP Team was formed to help review the RMProgram.  The Team consisted of the facility's most experienced and knowledgeable staff in the chlorination process. Included were a senior operator, a maintenance representative, the maintenance supervisor, and the operations supervisor.  The other Team members were the water superintendent and the consultant.\n\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nRMP policies are in place to monitor and guide the RMP program at the Midland Water Plant.\n\nAs part of the water plant's Prevention Program, a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) review was conducted in accordance with the policies, Operating Procedures (Ops) and Maintenance Procedures (MPs) were reviewed and reissued with new revision numbers and dates issued.  The facility's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) was also revised and updated.\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM-\n\nThe water plant facility is unable to provide adequate Emergency Response from the limited plant staff.\n\nThe City of Midland is a participant in a county wide, oneplan program for dealing with hazardous materials.  The first response for a chlorine release at the Midland Water Plant would be from the City of Midland Fire Department.  The Midland Fire Department personnel have the training and equipment to respond and safely shut down or contain a chlorine release.   The resp"

      "SummaryText": "onse time is less than ten minutes under most conditions.   Response is initiated by a telephone call to the Central Dispatch operator (911).   The water plant also has direct contact with the fire department via radio.\n\nAn on-site Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been adopted and implemented which provides for facility staff to be sheltered in place in the main water plant building, which is a separate building from the chlorination storage building.  The plan includes the necessary emergency notification and contact numbers.  It also includes emergency first-aid information.  The (EAP) provides that local responders will provide public notification and reporting.  A citywide siren warning system can be operated by the Central Dispatch operator to aid in notification of the public in a chemical release emergency.\n\nThe Midland Fire and Police Department representatives regularly attend meetings with the Local Emergency Planning Committee to help coordinate community local response for notification and evacuation.\n\n \nRECOMMENDATIONS FROM REVIEW OF PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS AND PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n1.  Automatic Shut-Off Valves- Presently, in the event of a process-piping leak, valves at the chlorine storage containers must be closed manually by turning a handle located outside of the chlorine storage building.  Automatic shut-off valves, which would close when a chlorine detector alarms, are being considered.\n\n2.  Replace chlorine piping at manufacturers or Chlorine Institute's recommended time frame.\n\n3.  Install security camera or door alarms in the chlorine storage area.\n\n4.  Update chlorine delivery driver checklist.\n\n\n"
