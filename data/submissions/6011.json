Chlorine is used at the station to disinfect water intended for distribution to the domestic water supply system. The station is unmanned.\n\nA leak monitoring device will notify VWD personnel in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nChemicals Subject to EPA'S Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nVWD uses and stores chlorine in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nTypically, two 1-ton chlorine cylinders are in use, and four 1-ton cylinders are stored at the station. Chlorine is imported to the pump station via truck, stored onsite in a one-ton container, and used for disinfection operations.\n\nAccidental Releases During Past Five Years:\n\nThe Vallecitos IV Flow Control Facility has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\nProcess Safety Management Accident Prevention Program:\n\nThe Vallecitos IV Flow Control Facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with its chlorine system. VWD's PSM programs include the following to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n\n7 Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n\n7 Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n\n7 Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n\n7 Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same safety training that VWD provides for its own employees.\n\n7 Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, including documentation of all inspections.\n\n7 Prompt corrective action for any non-co"

The key elements of the emergency preparedness program are as follows:\n\n7 All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n\n7 A team of engineers, supervisors and operators are trained, certified and equipped for hazardous materials (Hazmat) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.\n\n7 In the event of a large release the facility would immediately contact a telephone call-down list that includes the San Marcos Fire Department, the San Diego County LEPC, and several nearby commercial establishments that could be affected if the wind was blowing toward them during the release.\n\n VWD's Recent Steps to Improve Safety:\n\n Current plans call for the station to be taken out of operation in August 1999. If chlorine is no longer used and/or stored at the station, then additional chlorine safety improvements will not be necessary. However, if the station remains in operation, VWD is considering the following actions to either reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chlorine releases. These suggestions are based on recent safety reviews conducted as part of "

EPA requires facilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dispersed to an ambient concentration equal to the \"Toxic Endpoint Concentration\". The Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds were specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm but could interfere with people's ability to leave the area. The Toxic Endpoint Concentration for chlorine is 3 ppm. \n\n VWD conducted safety reviews with plant operators, engineers and safety managers to evaluate a wide range of hypothetical accidents that could cause releases of chlorine. In accordance with EPA's rule, two general types of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed:\n\n7 The \"Administrative Worst-Case Release\" that arbitrarily assumes the entire contents of the largest container of chemical is released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes. VWD is unaware of any conceivable event that could actually cause such a catastrophic release at the facility.\n\n7 \"Altern"

These hypothetical releases generally consist of valve leaks, temporary process upsets, and breakage to pipes or containers. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine :\n\nAnhydrous liquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature) is imported to the site by truck and stored in a 1-ton container for use in the disinfecting process. The Administrative Worst-Case Release Scenario assumes that the entire 1 ton of chlorine is emitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric conditions (1.5 meter/second wind speed and \"F stability\") that would result in minimal dispersion of the gas cloud as it blew downwind. The thermodynamic properties of anhydrous chlorine indicate that such a large instantaneous gas release is probably impossible. If the entire 1 ton of liquid chlorine were somehow discharged from the tank it would spill onto the ground and immediately cool itself until it formed a puddle of \"chlorine ice\", which would take much longer than 10 minutes to evaporate into a gas cloud. Nevertheless, the RMP rule dictates that the Worst-Case Scenario assumes the release of 1 ton of gaseous chlorine. \n\nThe formulas in EPA's RMP guidance for wastewater treatment plants were used to estimate the downwind impacts for the one-ton chlorine release. The formulas for chlorine apply to water treatment plants as well as wastewater treatment plants. Rural surface roughness conditions were used to account for the vicinity of the facility. The model indicated that the gas chlorine cloud would travel 3.0 miles before it dispersed to the 3 ppm Toxic Endpoint Concentration.\n\nThe estimated residential population within a radius of 3.0 miles from the facility is 15,000 people.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario for Chlorine :\n\nThe follow"

      "SummaryText": "ing hypothetical accident was selected as the Alternate Release Scenario: The pipe on the pressure side of the vacuum regulator fails, resulting in the release of chlorine through a 3/4-inch hole. The release is either observed or detected by the chlorine leak sensor. A repair kit (B-kit) is available, and the leak is repaired within 20 minutes. The release is partially contained by the building resulting in a reduction to 55 percent of the calculated unconfined release rate.\n\nUsing EPA guidance, the calculated gaseous chlorine release rate is 46 lb/min. This calculated release rate is conservative because according to the Handbook of Chlorination, for a one-ton cylinder at 68 0F, a chlorine withdrawal rate in excess of 0.28 lb/min (400 lb/day) will lead to a cooling of the system and potential freezing of the cylinder. Most of the released chlorine will freeze in a pool beneath the leak, and then be released at a much lower rate to the atmosphere. However, for the purpose of this evaluation, the calculated release rate of 46 lb/min was used.\n\nThe formula in EPA's RMP guidance for wastewater treatment plants were used to estimate the downwind impacts for the alternative release scenario. Rural surface roughness conditions were used. The model indicated that the gas chlorine could could travel 0.3 miles before it dispersed to the 3 ppm concentration limit.\n\nThe estimated residential population within a radius of 0.3 miles from the facility is 50 people."
