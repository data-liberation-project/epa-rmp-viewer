      "SummaryText": "1.  RMP Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1.1  Introduction \n\n\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Robert A. Weese Water Treatment Plant (Weese WTP) use chemicals, too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water supply to provide a safe drinking water to our customers.  Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using these chemicals as seriously as we take providing the public safe disinfected water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure safety, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Oceanside and the Weese WTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  Weese WTP has one chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers to limit the formation of possible harmful disinfection by-products.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal response, procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment.

      "SummaryText": " has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.  This plan will be reviewed by the San Diego County Hazardous Material Division (HMD), which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  To date, we have an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\n1.3  General Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\n\n\nThe Weese WTP is located at 3885 Silverleaf Lane in Vista, California in rural San Diego County.  Owned and operated by the City of Oceanside, it consists of a 25-million-gallon-per-day (mgd) water filtration plant.  The filtration plant finishes raw water that is supplied by either the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California or the State Project.  \n\n\n\nThe processes at Weese WTP include:\n\n? Flash mixing\n\n? Flocculation\n\n? Filtration\n\n? Chlorination\n\n? Chloramination\n\n\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance.  Chlorine is used for the chlorination of the plant effluent in the Chlorine Contact Tank.  Gaseous chlorine is drawn from the storage vessel as a gas and injected into the water.  \n\n\n\nChlorine is stored in 10 1-ton storage containers in the chlorine building, where the chlorine process is located.  This chlorine storage exceeds the minimum threshold planning quantities in the PSM, RMP, and CalARP Rules. \n\n  \n\n\n\n1.4  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nThe Weese WTP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of full face respirators, worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine deliveries; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine; and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine leak detector monitors continuously for leaks in the in the chlorine storage room.  The leak detectors are set to alarm at 0.5 ppm.  At 0.5 p"

      "SummaryText": "pm, an alarm is activated in the control room, and audible and visual lights are activated inside and outside the chlorination building.  In addition to the audible and visual alarms to alert operators near the chlorine building, the central computer sends an alarm to all SCADA monitors, the scrubber is activated and the vent fan is locked out. All 1-ton chlorine containers are equipped with fusible metal type safety relief devices, called fusible plugs.  Most 1-ton containers have six fusible plugs, three at each end, spaced 120 degrees apart.  In the event of a fire or other high temperatures, the fusible plug is designed to melt between 158?F and 165?F to relieve pressure and prevent a catastrophic rupture of the container.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine process is checked twice a day as part of the normal rounds at this facility. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at the chlorine building.  During chlorine cylinder change-out and emergency egress, operators use full face respirators which utilize an organic cartridge.  Fire extinguishers are available at 13 locations throughout the plant.\n\n\n\nAccess to Weese WTP is controlled by a fence and gate, which is locked between the hours of 4 p.m. and 7 a.m.  Visitors and contractors must be approved by Weese WTP staff prior to entry into the facility.  The chemical building remains locked and only a limited number of Weese WTP staff have keys.\n\n\n\nThe Weese WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n? Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n\n? Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors\n\n? Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n\n? A process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review\n\n? Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\n? Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, writ"

Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff\n\n\n\n1.5  Five-Year Accident History Summary\n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP Regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation on February 21, 2014, there have been no significant releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds (February 2009 - February 2014). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\n1.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe safety of the chlorine process was reviewed initially in 1999 and revalidated in 2004, 2009, and 2014 in the process hazard analysis.  Based on these reviews, additional changes were identified to improve the safety of the chlorination system.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the covered processes.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the City employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Develop"
