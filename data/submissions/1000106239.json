Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies.\n\nJM Smucker of Scottsville Kentucky recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\n\nTo accomplish JM Smucker of Scottsville KY's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes government mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of JM Smucker of Scottsville Kentucky Safety Program are to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with JM Smucker of Scottsville Kentucky Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program. These programs are designated to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68).\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases. The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic accidents. As a whole these programs are designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and any physical damage.\n\nB.

Due to the number of safety features put in place to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the environment and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system would pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\nC. Description of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n1. Employee Participation:\nThis program ensures that the employees are involved in establishing and implementing the prevention program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.\nThe program also ensures that the employees have complete access to the program on company property. Regularly scheduled meetings are held to discuss any concerns.\n2. Process Safety Information:\nWritten information has been collected which enables the employees or members of the general public to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration system. This written information includes the SDS program as well as a description of the design of the refrigeration system. The written information also includes the SDS on the ammonia in the refrigeration, standards, guidelines, and basic information about the chemistry of the refrigeration system, and the thermodynamic properties of the refrigeration system.\n3. Process Hazards Analysis:\nA formal analysis using the What-If/Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards. For each Management of Change and at regularly scheduled intervals, a Process Hazard Analysis will be conducted and the corporate review team will review its recommendations.\n4. Operating Procedures:\nWritten operating procedures have been developed that"

Every Management of Change and any operation involving the refrigeration system that was not previously identified will have an operating procedure developed and implemented for the actions required.\n5. Training\nA training schedule has been established and implemented which ensures that all employees that understand their responsibility during an emergency situation, whether its evacuation the building, responding to a release, or various other responsibilities during and after an ammonia release. Additional training schedules have been established and implemented for the operators of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n6. Contractors\nAll contractors will be screened and evaluated prior to any work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system. The contractors will also be periodically evaluated to ensure they perform their work duties safely. All contractors that work on the refrigeration system will also be required to have an ongoing safety program that includes compliance to 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.134.\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review will be completed for all new ammonia projects prior to its start-up to verify that all safety programs are established, all the training has been completed by all individuals involved, and construction has been completed according to design standards and guidelines.\n8. Mechanical Integrity\nA Mechanical Integrity program is established to ensure that the ammonia refrigeration system is built to the established codes and is maintained to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nPreventive maintenance procedures are also established to ensure the refrigeration system is maintained properly to minimize unexpected breakdown or failures.\n9. Hot Work Permit\nA hot work program has been established and implemented so that any cutting, welding, or burning operation on the ammonia refrigeration system must be authorized by the"

Incident Investigation\nThese procedures ensure that any incident (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n12. Compliance Audit\nAn audit of the Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan will be performed on a regular schedule to ensure that the program is being continually implemented and working properly.\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\nThere is no Five-year Accident History.\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials. It is the policy of JM Smucker to have trained employees that will respond, along with the Scottsville Fire Department. This ERP has been communicated to the Scottsville Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nJM Smucker regularly performs Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) Mechanical Integrity Inspections\n(MIIs) and Compliance Audits per their Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs. Areas for improvement during the PHAs, MIIs, and Compliance Audits are identified and corrective actions recommended. All recommendations are promptly addressed."
