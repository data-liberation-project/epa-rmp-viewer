The plant utilizes anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems for the Kill Plant and the Cook Plant that are housed in separate buildings.  The facility refrigeration systems incorporate 9,500 pound and 13,500 pound ammonia receivers, respectively, for the Kill Plant and the Cook Plant.  Based on the quantities of ammonia stored on the property, and the identification of public receptors within potential zones of impact from an accidental release , the ammonia refrigeration systems are subject to Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements under the Program 3 Release Prevention Program classification, in accordance with 40CFR Part 68. Previously, Southern Hens contained a wastewater chlorination system which was subject to RMP requirements, however changes were made to this system and the facility now stores less than the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia during the past five (5) years.  There have been no releases of chlorine from the water/wastewater chlorination system over the past five (5) years.  There have been no material changes to the process systems over the past five (5) years.  Worst-case and alternative release scenarios were modeled using the RMP*Comp program for anhydrous ammonia.  The radii of a release impact from ranged from 0.3 mile for a piping/valve failure to 2.2 miles for a catastrophic release from one (1) anhydrous ammonia tank.  The electronic Risk Management Plan (RMP) provides a synopsis of the written RMP which is maintained on site.  The written RMP contains this submittal, as well as detailed operation and maintenance plans and inspection forms, inspection and maintenance schedules, employee training program outlines, and technical specifications for the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine water/wastewater treatment systems.  \n\n\n\nSouthern Hens, Inc. maintains an active working relationsh"
