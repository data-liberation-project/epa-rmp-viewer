The Facility Policy:\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Farmers Grain Company (Deer Creek) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, and/or other authorities to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the invironment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 179,478 pounds in our two storage tanks one 30,000 gallon and one 11,000 gallon tank.  The 179,478 pounds was rounded to two nearest digits as per the instructions in the Process Chemicals section of the submit which makes the rounded figure 180,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe facility has referenced different codes and standards for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia to determine the reliability of the plant.\n\n4. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or envionmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120; and the company has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additonal specific an"
