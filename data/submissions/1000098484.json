              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. The routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of equipment and having preventative maintenance programs in place.  RVC-Galva has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) and Emergency Action Plans.  Employee training occurs on an annual basis in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  New employees are required to read the H&S and Emergency Action Plans and undergo training prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.  RVC-Galva's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe RVC-Galva facility complies with the most current applicable ANSI/CGA Standard requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and handling.  It is facility policy to adhere to the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers, and storage facilities administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture.  If an emergency were to occur, it is RVC-Galva policy to immediately notify the Galva Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that they respond to the emergency.  In addition to notifying the fire department, a call to the Henry County LEPC and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) will be made.  Since the facility is in close proximity to the City of Galva and Highway 34, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons and the facility has an evacuation plan in place.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at the facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize it for crop nutrient purposes.  While propane is a regulated substance under 112(r), the process is exempt from RMP reporting at this time because RVC-Galva is considered a retail facility where more than half of the income from propane is from direct sales to end users. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia system consists of three (3) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipm"

From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is ten (10).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program, the distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles. The ammonia tank sits over a gravel surface, passive mitigation was not considered as part of this scenario.  Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S Census data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles.Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S Census data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth.  \n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves and nitrogen gas emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when"
