As such, we have taken certain steps to ensure the safety of our employees and the community.\n\n\n\nThe resin process falls under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules since it uses formaldehyde solution, a listed chemical.  These regulations require Paneltech to design safety into the resin process by:\n\n*  Reviewing the safety of the process to identify potential problem areas and mitigate them prior to startup\n\n*  Developing a program for inspecting and maintining process equipment \n\n*  Instituting a training program for workers\n\n*  Managing changes to the process, including reviewing design and operational changes, removing any potential problem areas and training all affected employees on the changes\n\n*  Developing and maintaining information on the resin process, including key process parameters and operating instructions\n\n*  Determining the impacts of a worst-case release on the community\n\n*  Developing an emergency response plan and coordinating with local responders, such as the Hoquiam Fire Department\n\n*  Establishing a process of continuous review and improvement to identify and mitigate potential process problems\n\n\n\nPaneltech has taken several steps to ensure the safety of the formaldehyde / resin system, including:\n\n\n\n*  Use of administrative controls and level alarms to prevent tank overfills\n\n*  Installation and maintenance of industry-standard pressure and vacuum relief devices\n\n*  Operation of a vapor incinerator to reduce emissions of formaldehyde during normal and emergency conditions\n\n*  Installation of barrier walls around the formaldehyde storage tank and a drain under the tank\n\n\n\nWe are committed to being a outst"
