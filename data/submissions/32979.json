Anhydrous ammonia is used by AG as a refrigerant in the facility's perishables warehouse.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored or handled in the perishables warehouse refrigeration system is 25,000 pounds.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAG has a prevention program in place that complies with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for prevention of accidental releases of ammonia.  The release prevention program includes all the required elements for PSM, including a management system, process safety information, a process hazard analysis, operating procedures, an operator training program, a mechanical integrity program, management of change procedures, pre-startup review, internal compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, and contractor safety program. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo reportable accidents occurred in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nAG maintains a written emergency action plan to safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances and other emergencies at the perishables warehouse.  The plan identifies personnel roles at the facility (Incident Commanders, Emergency Response Coordinators, First Responders / Evacuation Coordinators) for handling the emergency and responsibilities for each of the personnel roles.
