The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Flemington, NJ. warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of Hydrochloric Acid 37% or Ammonium >20% solution from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above mentioned material. Rinchem has developed an emergency action program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of chemicals to employees. Rinchem management has opted to contract emergency response for releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. The Flemington warehouse Emergency Action Program consists of: Emergency Action Plan, Environmental Safety Health Reporting Procedure and Emergency Evacuation Plan.  The Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise.
