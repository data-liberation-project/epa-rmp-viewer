      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION:\nIt is the policy at the EM SCIENCE, Norwood, Ohio site to provide Accidental Release Prevention through facilities, equipment, training, and the reporting and investigation of all spills.\n\nFacilities include diking at the tankfarm tanker unloading area, at the tanker unloading area at Building #4, and the complete diking at the Building #19 Distillation Area.  In addition, the floors in the Distribution Center buildings are all sloped in order to contain any spill within a building and the internal drains drain to a reservoir which would contain any spill.\n\nEquipment includes catch boxes at the tankfarm tanker unloading area as well as the Building #4 unloading area.  Also, vapor monitors with alarms are located at the tankfarm, within the distillation area, within the GR Filling Area, and at the ether unloading pad.\n\nAll operators in the Distillation Area, the filling areas, and the tanker receiving areas are thoroughly trained on all operating procedures involving the handling and movement of toxic and flammable materials.  This has been done in accordance within the guidelines of the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule, 29CFR1910.119.  Included in this training is the prevention and mitigation of accidental spills.\n\nAll spills and other incidents at the site are required to be reported and are investigated by an accident investigation team.  The team is required to present corrective actions, and these corrective actions are tracked.\n\nA Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan has been prepared and is in effect for the facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE:\nThe site is equipped with a HazMat Team on all shifts while there is scheduled production.  This team is trained and equipped to handle any spill which could occur at the site.  Yearly refresher courses are held, as well as bi-monthly training sessions.  There is a complete set of emergency procedures in place with an In"

All EM SCIENCE employees are trained in their responsibilities during emergencies, whether these responsibilities are active or passive.\n\nThe Norwood and Cincinnati Fire Departments are familiar with the facility and scheduled walk-throughs are conducted every other year where they observe first hand the facility and the materials handled.  In addition, the SARA312 is submitted yearly to these two Agencies, as well as the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the Ohio State Emergency Response Commission.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\nThe EM SCIENCE Norwood facility consists of approximately 19 acres located on both the North and South sides of Highland Avenue at 2909 Highland Avenue, and 2910 Highland Avenue. The operations on the North side include warehousing and distribution of finished goods, as well as offices.\n\nThe operations on the South side include Distillation of high purity solvents, laboratories, storage of raw materials and packaging supplies, repackaging of dry powders and corrosive liquids, waste chemical disposal, and office functions.  Included in these operations are the receipt and storage of bulk solvents, as well as the receipt of bulk shipments of formaldehyde.\n\nRegulated substances handled in excess of threshold limits include Chloroform, Ethyl Ether, and Formaldehyde.  Chloroform is received in tank trucks at the tankfarm and is off-loaded to an underground storage tank.  Ethyl Ether is received at the tankfarm in tank trucks and is sampled at this location.  The tank truck is then moved to the Building #4 unloading pad where the Ethyl Ether is pumped to the filling area in Building #4.  The Formaldehyde is received in tank trucks at the Building #4 unloading pad, where the tank truck is sampled and unloaded; Formaldedhyde is filled in Building #4.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nToxics:\nWorst Case Release Scenarios were done for both listed toxics which are handled at the site in quantities excee"

Of the two, chloroform was found to have the greatest inclusion zone and is, therefore, used for the Worst Case Scenario.\n\nIn the worst case release scenario for chloroform, the inclusion zone would extend 0.38 miles in all directions from the tank truck unloading spot.  A release such as this would have the potential to adversely affect 1,751 persons.  In the inclusion zone would be the Biggs Supermarket Mall, the Highland Park Industrial complex, part of Cincinnati Milacron, several businesses along Highland Avenue as well as along Lester Road, Duramed, and several residences in Norwood and other surrounding areas.  There would be no long term environmental effects.  The calculations for the worst case for chloroform were done using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual and, used as a basis, a tank truck of chloroform weighing 43,441 pounds, which is a standard receipt size.  Along with these parameters, the toxic endpoint published in the reference guide was used to calculate the inclusion zone.  This worst case was calculated using the passive mitigation of the tankfarm diked area, but with no other mitigation efforts, and the assumption was made that the complete load is released at one fime.\n\nFlammables:\nEthyl Ether was used in the worst case scenario for flammables.  In this worst case scenario, the inclusion zone for a 1psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion was calculated to be 0.25 miles in all directions from the Building #4 unloading area.  This area was selected over the tankfarm because the ether tanker is at this location longer, and there would be more residential damage from this location.  At this overpressure, moderate structural damage may occur to residences, which in turn could cause personal injury.  A release such as this could have the potential of adversely affecting 1,054 persons.  Areas which would be affected would include the Highland Park Industrial complex,"

There could be some environmental affects due to fire extinguishing water run-off.  This could potentially affect the local storm sewer system.  The calculations for this Worst Case Release Scenario were done using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual and, used as a basis, a tanktruck containing 41,400 pounds of ethyl ether, all of which spilled on the ground at one time.  The passive mitigation of the existing concrete diked area was the only mitigation considered in the calculations.\n\nALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\nAlternate Case Scenarios were done for both of the listed toxics handled above threshold amounts, chloroform and formaldehyde.  One was also done for the one flammable handled above threshold amounts, ethyl ether.\n\nChloroform:\nThe Alternate Case Scenario for chloroform was assumed to be a 120 gallon spill at the diked area of the tankfarm unloading pad.  It was also assumed that there would be active mitigation which would reduce the amount of chloroform release to the atmosphere to 60 gallons.  This alternate release would result in a toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg./L. as listed in the EPA Offsite Consequences Guidance Manual at a distance of 0.08 miles.  This could affect 78 persons, at the far south side of Highland Park, and the Holt and Reichard Company.\n\nFormaldehyde:\nThe Alternate Case Scenario for formaldehyde was also assumed to be a 120 gallon spill at either the diked area of the tankfarm unloading pad, or at the diked area of the Building 4 unloading pad.  It was also assumed that active mitigation would reduce the effective release to the atmosphere to 60 gallons.  This type of release would have a toxic endpoint of 0.04 miles based upon the EPA Offsite Consequences Guidance Manual.  It would have no effects on personnel or environment off-site.\n\nEthyl Ether:\nThe Alternate Case Scenario for ethyl ether was assumed to be a 120 gallon spill a"

There would be no off-site effects on personnel or the environment.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAll EM SCIENCE employees are trained to recognize spills and releases and how to protect themselves and summon help in such situations.\n\nThere is a trained HazMat Team at EM SCIENCE which is capable of stopping any release and mitigating the same.  This team is trained to take proper action to reduce as much as possible the hazards to site employees and visitors, the environment, and the public during any release of any size.  There are HazMat Team members on all scheduled work shifts.  Training is done on specific chemical groups, such as flammables, corrosives, oxidizers, etc.\n\nAn excellent relationship, which has been one of mutual help, has been developed with the local and county emergency responders which would be of benefit should a release occur.  Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been done on all of the covered operations.  Included in these PHAs was the potential for releases and the process and system modifications to reduce the release potential.\n\nIn addition, a complete site hazard assessment was done by an outside consultant in late 1990 and early 1991.  Several areas for improvement were noted by the consultant and all of these areas have been addressed.  Where it was deemed necessary, corrections and changes were made to reduce the potential for accidents.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidents at the EM SCIENCE, Norwood, Ohio Site during the past five years which meet the required reporting criteria.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nRecommended changes from the several PHAs"

These are those which have the highest probability/severity ranking.  It is also planned to complete all of the lower category items as soon as this can be accomplished.  AT NO TIME WILL ANY PROCESS BE RUN WITH ANY KNOWN DEFICIENCY WHICH COULD FORESEEABLY RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT WHICH COULD DO HARM TO AN EMPLOYEE, THE FACILITIES, THE ENVIRONMENT, OR THE PUBLIC.\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses are done on those processes required under the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule, as well as processes which do not require a PHA but where it is felt that such a program would be advantageous in assuring good, safe operations.\n\nThe Safety Program at the Norwood Site is one of continuing improvement.  Any suggested changes noted by any employee are made a matter of concern and are reviewed to see if any improvements can and should be made.  In addition, the Program includes monthly Department Safety Meetings, scheduled Safety Audits of each department, a site Safety Committee with monthly meetings, and a Review Board which meets monthly to formulate overall safety policy."
