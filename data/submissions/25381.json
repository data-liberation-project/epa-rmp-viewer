At this site, Albemarle produces sample quantities (1 kg level) to semi-commercial quantities of various catalysts, flame retardants, agricultural intermediates, and pharmaceutical products.  Additionally, Albemarle has truck unloading facilities to receive and store elemental bromine.  This bromine has been supplied via pipeline to an adjacent external facility and to processes within the plant for nearly a decade, with an exceptional safety record.\n\nCurrently Albemarle has on site RMP covered levels of one toxic chemical, bromine, and two flammables, diethyl ether and isopentane.   Ammonia was previously listed as a toxic on site in 1999, however, ammonia storage has been eliminated and inventory reduced below the RMP covered level. Bromine is used extensively in two processes, 1) the Bromine supply terminal, and 2) manufacture of a polymeric flame retardant, HP-7010.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - In its operations, Albemarle is committed to the safety of the surrounding community, as well as protection of the environment.  With a strong Process Safety Management program in place, Albemarle combines both passive and active mitigation systems to prevent offsite consequences in the event of a spill of bromine.  In addition, our highly trained Emergency Response team is always available to respond to any incident, and bring it quickly under control. Emergency responders are trained annually and a trained Incident Commander is on site at all times to coordinate response efforts. Periodic drills are conducted to make sure that all affected personnel are trained and aware of emergency response proc"

      "SummaryText": "edures.\n\nFive Year Accident History - There have been no offsite accidents at this location that had any adverse effects to neighboring industry or the community.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Albemarle is committed to an ever improving safety program to maintain its rating in the top 5% in the chemical industry.  An increased emphasis is being placed on Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) of all chemical operations including bench scale processes for new projects.  Training in 2000 focused on schooling a large percentage of our wageroll and technical force in PHA techniques and developing additional technical PHA leaders to ensure that processes started up at our R&D Process Development Center are evaluated with regard to safety, health, and environmental aspects.  We have ongoing efforts to improve the quality of PHA studies on new processes in 2001 to ensure thoroughness and effectiveness. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Albemarle employs the latest technology in its process controls, and monitoring and mitigation systems to ensure that accidental releases are prevented or the risks associated with them are minimized.  Process documentation for covered processes are in compliance with OSHA 1910.119 requirements for Process Safety Management (PSM).  Equipment inspections are scheduled and documented to ensure vessel integrities.  Bromine storage and handling equipment are either glass-lined carbon steel, kynar lined piping, or nickel lined piping and vessel. Area monitors are maintained to detect bromine.\n\nWorst Case Scenario (Toxic) - A thorough Risk Management Program Hazard Analysis was performed for the site, showing the following worst-case scenario: \n\nComplete rupture of the 6,000 gallon bromine storage tank, causing an immediate pooling of bromine in the curbed concrete containment area.  At an evaporation rate of 200 pounds per minute, with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, an offsite impact distance of 5.4 miles is seen.  \n\nIn the"

      "SummaryText": " bromine storage and transfer area are two large, water-filled, underground sumps, which have sufficient capacity to hold the entire contents of the storage tank.  In the event of a spill or even a tank rupture, the bulk of the spilled bromine would enter the sumps and sink below the water, thereby preventing evaporation and minimizing any offsite impact.  \n\nAlternate Case Scenario (Toxic) - Further analysis of the most credible scenario for release of bromine gave the following scenario:\n\nA leak from a pipe or pipe flange causing 65 pounds of bromine to be released offsite, given a windspeed of 3.0 miles/second, producing an impact distance of 0.34 miles or 1800 feet.\n\nWorst Case Scenario (flammable) - A rupture of the isopentane tank trailer, releasing 40,000 pounds of material which then ignites to produce a vapor cloud explosion.  Under this scenario, the distance to a 1 psi overpressure is 0.27 miles.  \n\nFurther analysis of the most credible scenarios for releases of diethyl ether gave the following scenario:\n\nA leak from a transfer line during transfer of diethyl ether from the storage tank, releasing 500 pounds which then ignites in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under this scenario, the distance to a 1 psi overpressure is 0.06 mile, or 317 feet.  There are no residential areas, hospitals, schools, or recreation areas within this impact distance."
