Through Responsible Care&reg;, companies are committed to a continuing effort to improve the responsible management of chemicals. Accordingly, we believe and subscribe to the principles of the program including:\n\n      - To design and develop products that can be manufactured, transported, used and disposed of or recycled safely.\n\n      - To design and operate our facilities in a safe, secure and environmentally sound manner.\n\n      - To instill a culture throughout all levels of our organizations to continually identify, reduce and manage process safety risks.\n\n      - To support education and research on the health, safety, environmental effects and security of our products and processes.\n\n      - To communicate product, service and process risks to our stakeholders and listen to and consider their perspectives.\n\n      - To make continual progress towards our goal of no accidents, injuries or harm to human health and the environment from our products and operations and openly report our health, safety, environmental and security performance.\n\n      - To seek continual improvement in our integrated Responsible Care Management System&reg; to address environmental, health, safety and security performance.\n\n\n\nThe Lubrizol Painesville Facility is registered to ISO 14001:2004 and RC 14001:2013 EHS&S management systems.

We believe that ownership for these issues is at the operating level and that safety is everyone's job.  We are committed to operating our facility in compliance with applicable EHS&S laws and consistent with Responsible Care&reg;.  This is the philosophy that we communicate to our employees and that provides the grounding for our daily operations.  We believe that this philosophy is critical to our progress and a key contributor to the continued success of the Lubrizol Painesville facility.\n\n\n\nAs part of the safety program, all new employees go through a safety orientation program. This includes but is not limited to the correct use of personal protection equipment, safe practices on the job and awareness and use of emergency equipment.\n\n\n\nA training program is in place to train employees and contractors to reach and maintain proficiency in safe work practices and maintain the skills and knowledge necessary to perform their jobs. The training facility, which is housed in a renovated old production building, provides employees the opportunity to train in a plant environment on safety procedures such as hot work, line breaking, confined space entry, and lockout-tag out.\n\n\n\nMultiple layers of protection are developed and put in place on all processes to prevent accidental releases. Equipment is expertly designed according to strict engineering standards. Safety reviews are conducted on new and modified processes and equipment during design and before start-up. A maintenance and inspection program is conducted and documented to ensure facility soundness.\n\n\n\nLubrizol's ongoing process sa"

Some of the key elements are as follows:\n\n\n\nFor each covered process, associated process safety information is maintained, multiple layers of protection are in place including safe design of equipment, emergency and control devices and instrumentation, safe operational procedures, monitoring equipment, back-up systems, maintenance and inspection programs and an established training system for all employees. All of these mechanisms are in place to prevent an accidental release.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThere were no incidents at the facility in the past five years that meet the definition of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) reporting requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\n\n\nLubrizol maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) at its facility located at 155 Freedom Rd., Painesville, Ohio 44077. There is an emergency response organization (ERO) in place twenty-four hours a day consisting of an incident commander and trained emergency responders. There are also certified hazardous material technicians, EMT's, rescue squad and paramedics on staff. The ERP is documented within Lubrizol Painesville's Intranet web site and is accessible to all Lubrizol-Painesville employees. The Plan includes procedures for the notification of local fire authorities and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC). The Lake County Emergency Management Agency maintains a public notification and alert system capable of notifying the surrounding community as needed. There is continuous training of Lubrizol's ERO personnel on and off site and in conjunction with the local emergency responders. The ERP is updated as changes are needed.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nAn environmental, health and safety corrective action and preventive action system exists to address all odors, "

      "SummaryText": "spills, injuries and near misses at the facility. This system documents the incident and includes information on the root cause & mitigation measures and the individual responsible for implementing the corrective and preventive actions. A system is in place to review progress towards completion of the corrective and preventive actions and to check the effectiveness of these actions.\n\n\n\nSafety meetings and training are held on a regular basis to review these incidents to update employees on topics that will improve the overall environmental, health and safety of our facility and surrounding community.     \n\n                                                                                                                                 All the RMP covered processes undergo a process hazard analysis (PHA) on a routine basis to identify any potential hazards. If there are recommendation actions from these analyses, projects are initiated to address the recommendations as part of the facility's capital improvement process.  Past projects related to RMP regulated processes have included upgrades to fire suppressant systems and distributed control systems (DCS), level transmitters on vessels, replacement of liquid and vent piping, installation of safety barricades surrounding storage vessels, installation of sensors to detect a chemical release, replacement of metering devices on material feed lines and installation of additional emergency equipment.\n\n\n\nThese are some examples of Lubrizol's philosophy of responsibly maintaining a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community.\n\n"
