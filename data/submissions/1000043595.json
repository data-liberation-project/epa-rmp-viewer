Lubrizol is committed to continual improvement in health, safety, environmental and security performance.\"\n\n-- From: The Lubrizol Corporation Health, Safety, Environmental & Security Policy, February 2012\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nThe Lubrizol Corporation (Lubrizol) participates in Responsible Care&reg;, a program of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) launched in 1988.  Through Responsible Care&reg;, companies are committed to a continuing effort to improve the responsible management of chemicals. Accordingly, we believe and subscribe to the principles of the program including:\n\n      - To design and develop products that can be manufactured, transported, used and disposed of or recycled safely.\n\n      - To design and operate our facilities in a safe, secure and environmentally sound manner.\n\n      - To instill a culture throughout all levels of our organizations to continually identify, reduce and manage process safety risks.\n\n      - To support education and research on the health, safety, environmental effects and security of our products and processes.\n\n      - To communicate product, service and process risks to our stakeholders and listen to and consider their perspectives.\n\n      - To make continual progress towards our goal of no accidents, injuries or harm to human health and the environment from our products and operations and openly report our health, safety, environmental and security performance.\n\n      - To seek continual improvement in our integrated Responsible Care Management System&reg; to address environmental, health, safety and security performance.\n\n\n\nThe Lubrizol Painesville Facility is registered to ISO 14001:2004 and RC 14001:2013 EHS&S management systems.   To achieve these certifications, a third party auditor conducts a formal pre-assessment "

We believe that ownership for these issues is at the operating level and that safety is everyone's job.  We are committed to operating our facility in compliance with applicable EHS&S laws and consistent with Responsible Care&reg;.  This is the philosophy that we communicate to our employees and that provides the grounding for our daily operations.  We believe that this philosophy is critical to our progress and a key contributor to the continued success of the Lubrizol Painesville facility.\n\n\n\nAs part of the safety program, all new employees go through a safety orientation program. This includes but is not limited to the correct use of personal protection equipment, safe practices on the job and awareness and use of emergency equipment.\n\n\n\nA training program is in place to train employees and contractors to reach and maintain proficiency in safe work practices and maintain the skills and knowledge necessary to perform their jobs. The training facility, which is housed in a renovated old production building, provides employees the opportunity to train in a plant environment on safety procedures such as hot work, line breaking, confined space entry, and lockout-tag out.\n\n\n\nMultiple layers of protection are developed and put in place on all processes to prevent accidental releases. Equipment is expertly designed according to strict engineering standards. Safety reviews are conducted on new and modified processes and equipment during design and before start-up. A maintenance and inspection program is conducted and documented to ensure facility soundness.\n\n\n\nLubrizol's ongoing process sa"

There are also certified hazardous material technicians, EMT's, rescue squad and paramedics on staff. The ERP is documented within Lubrizol Painesville's Intranet web site and is accessible to all Lubrizol-Painesville employees. The Plan includes procedures for the notification of local fire authorities and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC). The Lake County Emergency Management Agency maintains a public notification and alert system capable of notifying the surrounding community as needed. There is continuous training of Lubrizol's ERO personnel on and off site and in conjunction with the local emergency responders.

If there are recommendation actions from these analyses, projects are initiated to address the recommendations as part of the facility's capital improvement process.  Past projects related to RMP regulated processes have included upgrades to fire suppressant systems and distributed control systems (DCS), level transmitters on vessels, replacement of liquid and vent piping, installation of safety barricades surrounding storage vessels, installation of sensors to detect a chemical release, replacement of metering devices on material feed lines and installation of additional emergency equipment.\n\n\n\nThese are some examples of Lubrizol's philosophy of responsibly maintaining a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community.\n\n"
