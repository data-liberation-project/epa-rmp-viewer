The  Santa\r\n     Maria Facility handles hazardous materials onsite,  and\r\n     recognizes  a  responsibility  to  safely  operate  the\r\n     facility in order to protect the surrounding community,\r\n     employees, and the environment.  The Facility has taken\r\n     a   proactive  stance  to  promote  the  overall   safe\r\n     operation  of the processes, with programs  to  prevent\r\n     accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and\r\n     maintaining  the equipment needed if an emergency  does\r\n     occur.   The  RMP  formalizes  existing  programs   and\r\n     procedures so that these programs may be reviewed  more\r\n     efficiently.\r\n\r\n     The   Santa   Maria   Facility   processes   oil   into\r\n     intermediate products for further processing  at  other\r\n     locations  to produce gasoline.

The\r\n     Refining  process  separates the crude  oil  into  four\r\n     products:   gas  oil,  naphtha  (pressure  distillate),\r\n     sulfur,  and  coke (solid carbon based material).   The\r\n     sulfur  is  generated because oil contains  significant\r\n     quantities  of sulfur that must be removed  to  produce\r\n     gasoline.   The gas oil and naphtha products  are  also\r\n     stored  in  the  Facility's  Storage  Tanks  prior   to\r\n     shipping by pipeline, while the solid sulfur and  solid\r\n     coke  are  shipped offsite by truck  or  railcar.
