Steel Group of USX Corporation is located in Clairton, Allegheny County Pennsylvania.  The facility is located 20 miles south of Pittsburgh on 392 acres along 3.3 miles of the west bank of the Monongahela River.  USX\u0012s Clairton Works manufactures metallurgical coke in chemical recovery ovens.  The facility\u0012s standard industrial classification (SIC) code is 3312.\n\nCoal received from barges or the plant coal storage piles is blended, pulverized and conveyed into storage bunkers in the coke battery area of the plant.  In the coke ovens, coal is heated in 12 to 25 ton batches in the absence of air for approximately 18 hours at 2000 degrees F, yielding metallurgical coke, coke oven gases and various coal chemicals.  When the coking process is complete in an individual oven, the contents are pushed into a railroad-quenching car.  The quench car is moved to one of a number of quench towers where the coke is cooled with river water.  The coke is conveyed to screening stations where it is sized prior to being shipped. \n\nDuring the coking process, coal volatiles exit the ovens through ascension pipes and goosenecks and are collected in overhead mains running the length of each coke oven battery.  These hot gases withdrawn under vacuum are initially cooled by spraying with recirculated flushing liquors.  Most of the tar in the raw gas drops out with this initial cooling.  Condensed tar and flushing liquor flow into decanter tanks where the tar is separated from the water phase.  The excess flushing liquor, which is the result of both water and inherent moisture in the coal, is the major single source of contaminated water from the coke plant.  The recovered tar is sent to various customers to be processed into various tar products.\n\nThe partially cooled gas is then passed through direct contact primary coolers, coke oven gas compressors and final coolers.

Anhydrous ammonia is used as a household cleaner; fertilizer; refrigerant for cold storage and used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.\n\nCoke Oven Gas (COG) is a mixture of hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and small amounts of other gases that evolve out of coal during its destructive distillation into coke.  COG is lighter than air, flammable and toxic.  The more hazardous gases are carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, and benzene.  Raw COG has an orange to brown color.  As the COG is processed, it becomes a colorless gas with a slight sulfide odor.  After processing, coke oven gas is used as a fuel on the coke batteries, boilerhouse, blast furnaces and heating purposes in the Mon Valley Plants.\n\nClairton Works developed and implemented the risk management practices associated with OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe U. S. Steel Group adopted a Statement of Policy concerning Environmental Management in October of 1991.  In the Environmental Management Policy, U. S.

The policy also seeks to reduce waste and achieve minimal adverse impact on the air, water and land through programs, which incorporate responsible environmental management. The statement stresses that environmental protection is a primary responsibility of every employee.
