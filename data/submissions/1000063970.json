Findings and recommendations assigned from the hazard analysis are documented within the electronic management system and completed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that all Company employees and any contractor employees, if appropriate, involved in production for covered processes are subject to the Company training program.  All maintenance training for these covered processes is addressed in the Mechanical Integrity Policy.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.   It is company policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies. Safety is an essential part of facility operations as evidenced by the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source\r\nThe facility's primary activities include distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals including compressed gases for use in water and wastewater treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management Program\r\nThe Company has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled e"

MOC will address both permanent and temporary changes.  Temporary changes will be considered in the same manner as permanent changes.  To ensure affected personnel are aware of changes made to the facility, MOC(s) will be reviewed and documented through the training roster.  MOCs will be initiated and completed through an electronic management system.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) will be performed for significant MOCs, for new processes regulated under OSHA's PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and  processes covered under EPA's RMP Program under 40 CFR 68 as well as modified existing covered processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.
