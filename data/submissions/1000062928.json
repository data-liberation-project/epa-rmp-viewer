With a team of outstanding employees and select growers, we grow, pack and ship apples, pears, apricots, cherries, peaches and nectarines for good health at our facility located in Yakima, WA. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. Multiple Hazard Assessments were conducted to fulfill the requirements for the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Gilbert Orchards, Inc, a Washington Corporation, located in Yakima County in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Section 1129(r) under the Clean Air Act.  The hazardous material used in the refrigeration system is anhydrous ammonia.  The threshold quantity for this regulated substance is 10,000 lbs.  Gilbert Orchards has approximately 39,751 lbs of ammonia, separated amongst four different processes. It has been determined that one of our processes, engine room number two does contain the largest vessel and could potentially release 10,757 lbs of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration systems were installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation. Piping and equipment is secured and protected; engine room doors are generally closed, tight fitting and open outwards; computerized controls allow remote operating of system; suction trap hi-level float; high discharge pressure shut down; low suction pressure shut down; high discharge temperature shut down; oil pressure failure shut down; high amperes shut down; automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls; oil filters plugged shut down; 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations; and 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situation.\r\n\r\nA.

We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. Furthermore offsite coordination is communicated and utilized to both off site responders and pubic receptors.The PSM Coordinator is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nAmmonia and Propane are the only substances covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. Gilbert Orchards has a total of four separate refrigeration processes in Yakima, WA. These processes are located North, South and West of the main office. The primary activities for each process are daily inspections of the entire refrigeration process. \r\n\r\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health\r\nAct's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation Program\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining Program\r\n\u00bf\tContractor Safety Program\r\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity Program\r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permit Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Action Plan\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audit Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTrade Secrets\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Systems\r\n\u00bf\tHazzard Assessment\r\n\u00bf\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\u00bf\tRisk Management Plan\r\n\r\nA worst-case and alternative release"

Five-Year Accident History\r\nThere are 0 ammonia-related accidents that have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences. \r\n\r\nE. Description of the Emergency Action Program\r\nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials & nearby public receptors to increase awareness and improve reaction times. Evacuation drills are an annual requirement which Gilbert Orchards exceeds by performing multiple evacuations of the plant and sheltering in place. The West Valley Fire Department, in Yakima County, has received a copy of the Emergency Action Plan and have walked through the plant so they are familiarized with the facility, the evacuation plan and contact information for Gilbert Orchards.  The Fire Department will call the nearest Hazmat Team in the case of a large release.  Gilbert Orchards' have been trained to not to respond in a Hazmat situation (any release at or above 300ppm classifies as a HAZMAT situation). \r\n\r\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWe have identified multiple potential changes to improve the safety of our ammonia refrigeration system. These changes involve modifications to better alert employees and public receptors in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nGilbert Orchards complies with:\r\n   * OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rules\r\n   * Washington State's safety regulations\r\n   * IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices."
