The facility is located in the Municipality of Penuelas, Puerto Rico.  The facility produces and sell electric power and supply natural gas to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA).  \r\n\r\nEcoElectrica uses anhydrous ammonia for the control of NOx emissions generated during the combustion process for power generation.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored within EcoElectrica premises.  EcoElectrica is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the rule and for that, it has developed a Risk Management Program for anhydrous ammonia in order to comply with the requirements of the OSHA rule (29 CFR 1910.119) and the RMP rule (40 CFR Part 68).  This determination was made through an off-site consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is delivered to EcoElectrica through tank trucks with an average capacity of 25,000 pounds per delivery. The material is transferred into a 15,000-gallon pressurized storage tank. A maximum of 75,158 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is stored at all times.\r\n\r\n1.2\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY ACTION POLICIES\r\n\r\nIt is EcoElectrica's policy to comply with all applicable Federal and State regulations and to protect the environment, human health, wildlife, natural and historical resources that could be impacted by the company's operations. All personnel, suppliers, contractors, visitors and other stakeholders must abide this policy while conducting activities at the facility. \r\n\r\n1.3\tWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario  for anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank over a period of 10 minutes due to a tank rupture.  The largest amount of anhydrous ammonia in the tank at any given time is 75,158 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is assume"

The zone of vulnerability for the alternative release scenario is determined to extend 0.2 miles from the anhydrous ammonia storage area.  No residents are located within a 0.2 miles radius of the anhydrous ammonia storage area.  \r\n\r\n1.4\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nEcoElectrica has implemented a Prevention Program for the safe use of anhydrous ammonia.  Operators, maintenance staff, and contractors are informed of anhydrous ammonia hazards, and hazard signs are posted in the anhydrous ammonia storage area.  Standard operating and maintenance procedures have been developed and employees who work with Anhydrous Ammonia are provided training.  \r\n\r\n1.5\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE \r\n\r\nEcoElectrica has an emergency plan to protect workers, the public, and the environment in the event of a major Anhydrous ammonia release.  EcoElectrica periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency action training.  EcoElectrica uses Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety.  Issues identified from PHA are then addressed in the EcoElectrica Prevention Program.  As part of the Emergency Action Plan, anhydrous ammonia gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any leak.  The emergency action plan includes response by the EcoElectrica safety department and local authorities.\r\n\r\n1.6\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in excess of 100 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site; or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  This also applies since start-up in 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.7"

Recommendations from the most recent PHA in December 2018 include the evaluation of further risk minimization options.  A Compliance Audit was conducted in December 2017 to verify the effectiveness of the program."
