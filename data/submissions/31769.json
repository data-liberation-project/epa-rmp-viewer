      "SummaryText": "The Marion Water Treatment Plant(WTP) is a two million gallon per day potable water treatment plant supplying the City of Marion,IL(population 16600) and a satellite supply, the Wye Water District (approximate population 1000), with drinking water.  The present plant was upgraded in 1987 at the site of the previous water treatment plant and is located at approximately the center of town.  As required in the State of Illinois, water is disinfected at the Marion WTP with gaseous chlorine, mixed with water, applied at several feed points in the treatment plant.  The chlorine is supplied by the Ulrich Chemical Company and is delivered to the WTP in steel 1 ton containers as a liquified compressed gas.  The ton containers are received and kept in a separate room with proper handling and storage and feed equipment with a maximum of 4,000 pounds and an average of 2,000 pounds in storage.  The storage room is a 15' x 15' steel reinforced concrete enclosure with two outward opening doors.  A chlorinemonitor can detect low levels of chlorine and activate an alarm and an exhaust fan located at floor level.  This is tested at least once per week.  The containers are moved on to container cradles by use of a monorail with a lifting beam.  The WTP is manned by at least one person, twenty four hours per day, seven day per week.  In the event of a chlorine leak, this person has been instructed to first determine the extent of the leak and if more than one person is needed, to call the Marion Fire Department (MFD) also manned twenty four hours a day.  Each operator on duty has been instructed on safety procedures and hazards associated with chlorine handling and emergency response.  Within the past year, operators have received  instruction from the MFD on the use of SCBA and protective clothing need to go into a chlorine filled room.  All personnel have access to MSDS sheets and safe chemical handling instructions are available for review.  Emergency response procedures and emergen"

      "SummaryText": "cy telephone are posted in the water treatment plant lab for quick response time.  In addition, the city has a safety director who regularly has had safety and first aid training at the job site during working hours.  In a worst case release, The MFD would be the first agency to respond for leak repair or containment and evacuation of the affected area.  The MFD would have assiatance with evacuation from the Marion Police Department and Williamson County Emergency Management Agency. (LEPC)  Water plant and fire department have been instructed on using the ton container repair kit \"B\" which is designed to contain most leaks encountered with containers.  To minimize risk from late night/early morning leaks, container changing is only done from 7AM TO 2PM, Monday thru Friday by the plant superintendent and chief operator.  The chlorine leak detector and feed equipment were both updated and installed in December 1998 and January 1999 respectively, and are serviced and calibrated on a yearly basis by a Honeywell Company service technician.  The chlorine feed system consists of a chlorinator directly mounted to the ton container and uses a single pressurized connection to minimize leaks.  It's all vacuum operation causes air to enter the system in the case of a malfunction.  This prevents chlorine gas from escaping.   The system shuts down automatically if the operating vacuum is lost of the water supply to the ejector is interrupted.  The feed system is operated manually so the operator is at the chlorinator when it is turned on and can determine a feed or leak problem immediately upon startup.  We are proud to announce that we have had no accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five years.  Planned changes are to improve training  and safety procedures of both plant personnel and fire department personnel.  We are also considering using an alternative disinfectant for treating the water."
