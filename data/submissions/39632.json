The emergency response plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n1.  To save lives.\n2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.  To protect the environment.\n4.  To minimize property damage.\nSYSCO maintains a Process Safety Management committee which contains members who are the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures for which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This plan was updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nSYSCO has operated its ammonia refrigeration system since 1990.  The ammonia process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations.  The facility is located at 250 Wieboldt Drive in Des Plaines, IL 60016.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 12,000 pounds of ammonia for the storage of various food products.  An additional 300 pounds of ammonia in 150 pound cylinders, are stored on-site to replenish the refrigeration system as necessary.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensors are mounted on the engine room roof, and all evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility that SYSCO occupies was originally built in 1969/1970.  The ammonia refrigeration system installed "

In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on the engine room roof.  The engine room is provided with continuous ventilation and all equipment is monitored for temperature and pressure 24 hours a day.  The facility is secured and guarded at all times.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Start-up, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere is no reportable accident history at this facility from June 1999 through July 21, 2004.\n\nEMERGENCY REPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest the leak will notify a supervisor, maintenance or risk management.  Under certain circumstances an alarm will sound and automatically notify the 24 hour security company who in turn will page the Facility Manager.  In either event a team of at least two trained individuals will respond to the scene to assess the situation.  Portable radios and an ammonia sampling meter are used for communication and air sampling.  The emergency coordinators will be notified of the situation and will determine what procedures and personnel, including contractors, are necessary to remedy the problem.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.  A mock ammonia evacuation drill was conducted on June 22, 2004 in conjunction with the local fire department and Hazmat team members.  A written Emergency Response Plan is in place for this facility. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll recommendations originally submitted in the 1999 RMP have been completed.  The following recommendations are targe"
