The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Buena Vista Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unstaffed and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Buena Vista facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nIn normal operation, four 1-ton chlorine containers are manifolded in two banks of two containers to supply chlorine.  These four containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  The facility has connections for two additional 1-ton containers, which could be used as spares for either of the two banks, but are not used per administrative controls.  These two containers are not equipped with the Halogen actuators and can be manifolded together. All six containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in the containers.  There are trunnions for storage of 3 additional full or empty ton containers without process connections.\n\nChlorine gas is withdrawn from a bank of containers through pigtails which are attached to the ton container gas valves.  The chlorine flows under pressure to a chlorine header then to the pressure-sensitive automatic switch-over valves.  The switch-over valves are triggered by the rise in vacuum pressure in the chlorine feed line between the switch-over valve and the chlorinator.  The rise in vacuum o"

If this occurs, the switch-over valve will open the alternate chlorine connection, demanding chlorine gas from the alternate chlorine containers.  The chlorine gas then leaves the switch-over valve under vacuum to two of the three chlorinators.  From the chlorinators, the gaseous chlorine travels under vacuum to the injectors.\n\nIn the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high pressure water supply to form a chlorine solution, which then travels to diffuser tubes located in the pipelines.  Residual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine in the pipelines downstream of the diffusers and provide feedback control for subsequent chlorine dosing.\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors have been installed inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\n\nThe Buena Vista site has installed a main caustic solution scrubber actuated by the chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm that can neutralize up to 4,000 lb of chlorine. \n\nA dry media chlorine \u00c2\u00bfmini-scrubber\u00c2\u00bf unit (MS) has also been installed at the BVCS, which is currently non-operational. MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the vacuum regulating valve vents. It can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion.\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.  In addition, a diesel emergency generator is available for the operation of the chlorine scrubber in the event of power outages.\n\nThe facility is normally unstaffed; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Buena Vista Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  LADWP prepared and submitted the RMPs for the Buena Vista facility in June 1999 and June 2004.  This RMP is the five year update of the June 2004 RMP.  LADWP prepared a Program Level 2 RMP in 2004 because Buena Vista Chlorination Station is not subject to PSM regulations. In the excess of caution, LADWP has now decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP. Thus, this 2009 update of the RMP demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tGeneral facility and regulated substances information.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSummary of the accidental release prevention program and \n        chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFive-"
