This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Lindsay Gas Plant located near Lindsay, Oklahoma will operate a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from wet natural gas.  As a result of these operations, one EPA regulated flammable substance (natural gas liquid) is processed, recovered and stored at the facility.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) risk management program regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?S) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement PROGRAM 1 under EPA?s accidental release prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Lindsay Gas Plant Plan encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as pa"

These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and accidental release prevention programs. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Lindsay Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.   These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on a going basis.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\n\nChemical specific information, including emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Lindsay Gas Plant has a comprehensiv"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Lindsay Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analysis as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company?s local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, Lindsay Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to process equipment operating outside their upper or lower limits.  This information along with operating procedures is readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lindsay Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nContractors\n\nThe Lindsay Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce durin"
