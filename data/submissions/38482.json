The facility uses chlorine and ammonia.  Use of these chemicals is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning regulations (40 CFR, Part 68) herein referred to as the RM regulations.  Under the CAAA and the RM regulations, the facility is considered to be a stationary source.\n\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for an RM Plan which form the basis of the RM program for the Shenandoah facility.  EPA's five key regulatory requirements for an RM program are:\n\n1) Management Plan\n2) Hazard Assessment\n3) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n4) Emergency Response\n5) Risk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements\n\nThis RM plan is based on the requirements listed above and is organized to reflect them in five sections, as summarized below.\n\nRequirement 1.  Management Plan\nThe Business unit Manager of EHS as well as the facility Environmental Engineer/PSM Coordinator are responsible for ensuring compliance with the RM regulations at the Shenandoah facility and are supported by the Corporate RM Program Manager.  The Business Unit Manager of EHS and the Environmental Engineer/PSM Coordinator are supported locally by Utilities and Wastewater treatment operators, safety/security and staff level personnel.  Individuals have been assigned responsibility for all five elements of the RM program, including management, prevention, hazard assessment, emergency response, and RM plan updates.\n\nIn the past five years, none of the processes subject to RM regulations have had releases that have resulted in offsite property damage or offsite health consequences requiring medical treatment for chemical releases or fire. On-site releases have been reported to regulatory agencies as required."

      "SummaryText": "\n\nRequirement 3.  Prevention Program\nThe Shenandoah facility has a chemical release prevention program for each regulated process.  The prevention programs for the chlorine and ammonia processes were developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119) and have been in place since 1993.  The 12 key provisions of the release prevention program for the ammonia and chlorination processes, for which  EPA require  Program 3 prevention programs,  are as follows.\n\n- Employee Participation\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Contractors\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Management of Change\n- Incident Investigation\n- Compliance Audits\n\nRequirement 4.  Emergency Response \nThe emergency response program at the facility consists of personnel trained to recognize releases and immediately notify Coors Security by telephone.  Security sends a trained incident commander to the scene to assess the situation and engage the proper internal and external emergency response personnel and equipment.  When external emergency responders are needed, a joint command is then established which is led by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) and supported by CBC Security and CBC personnel.  The AHJ will initially be the Elkton Fire Department.  The AHJ can call additional external emergency response resources to the scene that would include the Rockingham County Hazmat team, Virginia State Police and other agencies, as needed.  Alternate Safety/Security personnel responsible as emergency contact:  Ronnie Hensley, Steve Jarrell, Sandra Stickley, Todd Dyer, Todd Glendye, and Mike Ouderkirk (all reached on 540-289-8100)"
