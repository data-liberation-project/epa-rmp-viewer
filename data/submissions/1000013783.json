      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Arnette Ltd., Inc.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Arnette Ltd., Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Richmond Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Development, manufacture and supply of raw materials for the epoxy resin formulator.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-]. Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is used for producing reactive diluents.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] at our facility is 85,260.00 lb. \n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenario.\n\nScenario: The Epichlorohydrin spill. \n\nArnette LTD. receives its epichlorohydrin from tank wagons that come in without any pressure on them and are equipped with only dry disconnect valves.   If the vessels come in with pressure, the operator in charge of th"

      "SummaryText": "e unloading has to carefully release the pressure through controlled measures to avoid a hose from being blown off.\n\n \nIf by chance the pressure gauge was reading zero pounds of pressure and the actual pressure inside the vessel was over 15 pounds of pressure, an accidental release of epichlorohydrin could occur.  The operator, following the guidelines to offload epichlorohydrin, checks to see if the wagon has pressure and reads zero pounds.  As he opens the valve to start pumping the raw material into the bulk storage tank, the pressure built up inside the vessel blows the hose off the tank wagon spraying epichlorohydrin inside the building.  \n\nRemedy: The first thing the operator would have to do is to close the valve on the wagon using the emergency shut off valve located near the front of the tank wagon if he can get to it without putting himself in more danger.  Then evacuate the area and notify all personnel of the immediate dangers associated with the incident and evacuate the buildings.  Using the Emergency Response plan, that Arnette Ltd. created for a step by step guide dealing with an emergency situation, notify the proper authorities and agencies for the necessary clean up.  While waiting for the Hazmat team to arrive, the plant personnel with the help of the Richmond Fire Department would set up boundaries to keep harm from any individual.  MSDS's would be distributed to the incoming Hazmat team and a decontamination center would also be set up.  Once the Hazmat team arrives, the authority would be transferred from Arnette Ltd. to them with the employees standing by to assist if needed.\n\nPrevention:  \n\nThe employees, that are trained to off load epichlorohydrin, have been informed of the possible dangers that are associated with these trucks.  The employees check all gauges and if they suspect that a gauge is wrong, then the truck is rejected or inspected by a more trained individual.\n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemic"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  We also have an air operating permit under the Clean Air Act.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nArnette Ltd. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis is hazard and operability analysis .  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a yearly  interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Arnette Lt. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nArnette Ltd. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes."
