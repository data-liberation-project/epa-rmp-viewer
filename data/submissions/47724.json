RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT YOUR FACILITY \n\nHarris County Fresh Water Supply District No. 51 (the ?District?) maintains a policy of providing the facility with the training, equipment, and materials to prevent the accidental release of chlorine into the environment.  Training is provided to all employees involved with the operation and maintenance of the District?s facilities.  The training is general in nature as well as site specific.  All the facility operators are certified by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and have received repeated and specialized training regarding the safe handling of chlorine.  Annual maintenance is carried out on all chlorination equipment to minimize the risk of failure of each component.  Proper procedures for operation of the equipment are made available to all operators.  Periodic inspection of the facility helps ensure that potential problems are identified and corrected as soon as they appear.\n\nYOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nThe District facility that utilizes chlorine in excess of the threshold quantity is the Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant located at 14701 Woodforest Blvd.  The plant is located near the southeast corner of Woodforest Blvd. and East Beltway 8 in Harris County, Texas.  The plant treats the wastewater from three water districts in eastern Harris County.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater prior to it being released into Carpenter?s Bayou.  The chlorine is present in one-ton cylinders and as many as four cylinders may be on hand at any given time.  Chlorine is injected into the treated wastewater stream by pumps located approximately eight feet below the surface of the water.  The chlorine is dissolved into the water stream in such a manner as to prevent the gas from escaping into the atmosphere.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE P"

      "SummaryText": "REVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe District complies with all applicable laws and rules regarding the safe handling of chlorine.  Compliance is accomplished primarily by the training given to the facility?s operators.  Periodic inspections and annual maintenance of the equipment also contribute to the safety of the facility.  The constant awareness of the dangers of chlorine is the primary motivator for the operators to practice safe procedures.  Management?s willingness to devote the necessary training and equipment maintenance to continue to maintain a safe facility is also key to the success of the RMP.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThe facility has not experienced a chlorine related accident during the last five years.  In fact, there has not been any chlorine related accident since the facility was placed on line in 1976, over thirty years ago.  This record speaks to the effectiveness of training and maintenance in preventing accidents.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nIn the event of a chlorine release other than a small leak, the first responder is likely to be the manufacturer that supplies the chlorine to the facility.  The manufacturer?s plant is located approximately two miles from the facility and could respond very quickly.  The manufacturer has personnel trained to respond to large releases and maintains the emergency equipment needed to contain a large leak.  Additionally, the LEPC has plant facility members along the Houston Ship Channel only a few miles from the plant.  The majority of the LEPC members have emergency response crews trained to handle the release of toxic substances into the environment.  Because the facility is located in an industrial area, the fire departments in the area are also trained to respond to such emergencies.  Finally, the City of Houston Hazardous Materials Unit can respond very quickly to any emergency. The plant?s operators are not trained to respond to a major release, but are trained"

      "SummaryText": " to shut down the chlorine equipment when severe weather such as hurricanes or tornadoes are expected.  Small leaks can be safely handled by the plant operators and the equipment and training is provided to them for that purpose.  Public notification in the event of a major release is to be accomplished by the facilities manager.  Radio, television, and notice to local police and fire officials would be provided in the event such notice became necessary.  Drills are not conducted on site because the facility operators are not trained or equipped to handle major releases.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nThe facility?s history of no chlorine related accidents indicate that no major changes are warranted.  The management will continue to provide operator training and support the annual maintenance of the chlorination equipment to minimize the risk of major releases."
