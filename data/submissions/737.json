THE FACILITY POLICY\n       The owners, management, and employees of FARM & HOME COOP are committed to the \n       prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release\n       should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other\n       authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\n       the environoment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n        -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to \n          farmers.\n        -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and\n          for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients\n        - The maximum quantity stored wou;d be 200,000  pounds in our 1-30,000,&,1-18,000 \n           gallon storage tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release and the alterative release scenario \n       A. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\n            (or tank car) release as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be \n            130,000 pounds,which repesents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity \n            as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)\n            is 2 miles.\n\n      B. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential\n           incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of \n           dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.7 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program \n           The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safty Requirements for the Storage and Handling of \n           Anhydrous Ammonia,K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.., and the \n           standeards of the U.S. Occup"

Ther have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n          - Have coused any deaths,injuries,or significant property damage at the facilty;nor\n          - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths,injuries,evacuations,sheltering in place,proprety\n            damage,or environmental damage.\n\n6.
