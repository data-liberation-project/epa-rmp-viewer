The plant is stationary located in the north east part of town, in which the only regulated substance handled is anhydrous ammonia.  In the event that there is a major disaster regarding this plant, an area encompassing 4.4 miles should be evacuated to prevent inhalation or exposure.  In the event of a small accidental release, an area of one-tenth of a mile should be cleared, to prevent any exposure of contact with the human skin.  It should be made aware that the anhydrous ammonia plant in Northwood is very safe, and has never had a leak or accident in its 25 year history.  We are always taking every measure possible to keep the plant as safe as possible, and  protect the employees and citizens of Northwood.  We have a safety program that addresses the hazards of the plant, as well as operating and training procedures.  Maintenance and regular inspections are very routine, to keep our long standing record of being accident free."
