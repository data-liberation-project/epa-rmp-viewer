The facility is in Crawford County. The site is on the north side of Highway 30, across from the intersection of Westcott Road and Highway 30. \n\n\n\nThe Andersons Denison Ethanol LLC facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 43 people.  The following operations are performed at this facility:  grain receiving and storage; hammer milling; fermentation; distillation, dehydration and evaporation (DDE); separation; wet and dry distillers grain and solubles (WDGS / DDGS) drying; storage and shipping; and ethanol storage and shipping.  \n\n\n\nThe plant receives corn by way of the on-site grain elevator.  Grain is stored temporarily in the concrete silos and steel bins, prior to being fed to three hammer mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area.\n\n\n\nAdditives are incorporated into the process and the product is fermented, creating a beer mash.  The product goes through a scrubbing process to removed residual volatile organics and then enters the distillation and condensation process.  The beer is approximately 10% ethanol and 90% non-fermentable corn solids.  The ethanol is separated from the beer at this stage and leaves as 190-proof ethanol, which is sent to a bulk storage tank.  The 190-proof contains residual water, so it is filtered one more time, which produces 200-proof ethanol.  Lastly, the 200-proof ethanol is mixed with a denaturant and stored in either of two tanks prior to transferring to the truck or rail loadout areas.  Vapors from the process vessels and distillation are controlled through a thermal oxidizer.\n\n\n\nThe distillation process removes the ethanol from the beer, non-fermentable corn solids and water.  The remaining water is then removed from the residual mash or whole stillage.  The resulting product is called wet"

The MDG's are sold directly to customers as high-quality animal feed.  The other half of WDG's are dried to approximately 11% moisture content and is called Dried Distillers Grain.  The DDG's travel through the cooling tube before being stored in the DDG Building located on the south side of the facility.  They can be stored for extended periods of time and are shipped out by truck or rail.  \n\n\n\nThe thermal oxidizer serves as the primary emission control device for the two dryers as well as various process vents.  The thermal oxidizer is very efficient at controlling particulates, carbon monoxide, VOC's, HAP's and nuisance odors.\n\n\n\nThe facility also has a water cooling tower for non-contact cooling water used in the fermentation process and a fire pump for emergency use.\n\n\n\nRMP Applicability & Chemical Description\n\n\n\nThe facility stores and utilizes one product containing chemicals that require participation in the Risk Management Plan.  That material is natural gasoline, a flammable mixture, which is used as a denaturant.    \n\n\n\nThere are multiple chemical constituents within natural gasoline.  Based on chemical analysis, four of those constituents, butane; pentane; 2,2-dimethylpropane; and 2-methylbutane are subject to the Risk Management Plan. By weight, butane makes up 0.806%, pentane makes up 24.518%, 2,2-dimethylpropane makes up 0.237%, and 2-methylbutane makes up 22.960% of the natural gasoline.  Total percent by weight of chemicals subject to the Risk Management Plan requirements is 48.521%.  \n\n\n\nNatural gasoline is stored in a steel tank located in the facility's tank farm.  The maximum usable capacity is limited to 85% of 100,000-gallon design of the tank.  Secondary containment consisting of a diked structure containing an impermeable liner and gravel overlay, surrounds the tank farm.  \n\n\n\nSummary of Release Scenario"

The usable storage tank capacity is 100,000 gallons or 552,800 pounds of natural gasoline.  Of the 552,800 pounds of natural gasoline, 268,200 pounds (48.521% by weight) are subject to the worst-case release evaluation for flammable mixtures of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nRMP Comp was used to determine the distance to 1 psi overpressure and 2010 US Census Bureau Data was used to determine public receptor information.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release - Flammable Mixture, Natural Gasoline\n\n\n\nThe most likely cause of a natural gasoline emergency is a release during a delivery due to a faulty hose or valve resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Deliveries are made by rail-car and pumped into the natural gasoline storage tank.  Rail-cars are designed to carry 30,000 gallons or 165,600 pounds of natural gasoline.  At 48.521% by weight, 80,400 pounds are Risk Management Plan chemicals.  \n\n\n\nRMP Comp was used to determine the distance to 1 psi overpressure and 2010 US Census Bureau Data was used to determine public receptor information.\n\n\n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented\n\n\n\nThe Denaturant storage tank has a floating roof and can hold up to 100,000 gallons.  The tank fill limit is 85% to control the possibility of an overfill and spill in containment.  Overfill can cause damage to tank and product on the ground.  The lower limit is 10% to prevent issues with displacement of the floating roof.  Each rail-car will contain enough product to fill 30% of the Denaturant storage tank.  Before unloading a rail-car the Denaturant storage tank volume is checked by the control room to make sure there is enough room in the Denaturant storage tank for the entire load, the tank must be no more than 55% full to accept and unload a natural gasoline rail-car or trailer.

Specific procedures were developed for the unloading of Natural gasoline.  If a release were to occur the delivery attendants could stop the flow within minutes.  The loadout area, where deliveries occur, has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.\n\n\n\n\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place include:\n\n\n\nExcess flow valves are located on appropriate liquid valves used in transferring the natural gasoline.  They close automatically if the volume of liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\n\n\nBack check valves are located on the unloading lines are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents natural gasoline from flowing back to the transport tank from the storage tank.\n\n\n\nThere manual emergency shut off valves near the natural gasoline storage tank.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.

Issues are documented and assigned to employees for follow-up. Records of all meetings are kept at the facility.\n\n\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release\n\n\n\nIn the event of a small, controlled leak or defective valve, employees are instructed to shut down the transfer process and, if possible, don the appropriate PPE, approach the shutoff valve from upwind and attempt to turn it off. \n\n\n\nFor an uncontainable release, employees will immediately call the police and fire department or other first responders, as appropriate.  All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated to an upwind location. Once the response team has arrived, we will work in concert with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak or spill. \n\n\n\nThe employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order:  911, the facility Manager, the corporate Safety Department emergency phone number, the state emergency hotline and the National Spill Response Center phone number.  All applicable contact names and numbers are found in the facility spill and emergency action plan. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication procedures with responders\n\n \n\nThe local fire department is invited to tour the facility on an annual basis.  Facility management, employees and fire department personnel have jointly discussed the location of the natural gasoline storage tanks and response procedures on a regular basis.  They know the location of all emergency shutoff valves and on-site response equipment.  We believe that a strong relationship with first responders is our best defense.\n\n\n\nThe LEPC and state regulatory agencies receive a copy of our hazard"
