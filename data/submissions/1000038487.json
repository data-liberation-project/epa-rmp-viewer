      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nEnergy Transfer has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, resources such as training, design considerations, installation and maintenances of each process and facility. Energy Transfer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release occurs, the intent is that our trained personnel will respond to and contain the release. We support and work closely with emergency responders who might assist Energy Transfer in the event a release occurred.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Rosewood Dew Point facility is located 7.9 miles north-west of Gilmer, Texas. Specifically the address is 7176 Ermine Rd, Gilmer, Texas. The facility is a small facility that is designed to remove a portion of the heavier hydrocarbons such as Hexane and heavier from a gas stream in order for the gas stream to meet pipeline specification. The facility currently has an inlet gas throughput of slightly less than 5.0 MMSCFD of inlet gas and produces approximately 1,600 gallons per day of MGL product. The Rosewood facility does not use, process or store reportable quantities of toxic substances. The facility is subject to the EPA RMP program due to quantities of flammable materials greater than 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable material in processes at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion involving two, jointly connected propane storage tanks that are used to store refrigerant propane used within the process. The tanks would collectively store a maximum quantity of propane equaling 13,088 pounds of HD-5 propane. Using the EPA RMP*COMP software for determining the maximum distance of 1 psi endpoint for this WCS, it was determined that t"

An alternative scenario which included propane within the NGL recovered process and considering that the release was a BLEVE, the endpoint for this scenario (18,987 pounds of propane)  also calculated as 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years the processes has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(B)(1)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Rosewood Dew Point facility. This program addresses guidance from the RMP Prevention Program for Program 2 Facilities.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Rosewood Dew Point facility contains only reportable quantities of flammable materials, specifically HD-5 propane which is purchased as needed and delivered to the facility via a transport truck and is stored in two tanks that are interconnected and recovered material that includes small quantities of ethane, propane, butanes and hexanes plus. This recovered material does not contain reportable quantities by itself but when the propane is reported with the purchased material, it is determined to be approximately 18,000 pounds of propane. The facility has obtained and is familiar with the MSDS for both propane and the NGL product.  Additionally, the storage and process limits have been established and communicated to personnel. Equipment information for the processes are either contained in job books, on vessel name tags or has been calculated with results in the RMP manual. It should be noted that overall the affected processes operate at generally low pressures and temperatures generally encountered and thus utilize only a fraction of the capability of piping and vessels.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nA \"What if\" PHA has been conducted on the affected processes.

The recommendations are being addressed by management and personnel to determine if they will become action items. These substantive recommendations include 1) update several P&IDs to reflect minor changes to the system over time, 2) evaluate installation of check valve on NGL tank make line so that if an event caused a piping break, the tank contents would be preserved within the tank, 3) install PSV (s) on each propane storage tank (or a common one for both tanks) that is set at the proper relief pressure based on tank MAWP and which can be verified for both set point and capacity periodically and 4) the stabilizer tower contains a psv that is limited to slightly over 5.0 MMSCF relief capacity which is adequate for current operations. However, throughput may be increased and the recommendation is to evaluate the need for additional relief capacity at this time. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nBoth general and specific operating procedures have been developed for the operation of the facility. The procedures have incorporated specification for hydrocarbons and the safe handling of these materials with the development of the procedures. Procedures cover startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdowns. Procedures are maintained current and accurate and are updated as often as required.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Rosewood Dew Point facility is a small unmanned facility that generally is operated or maintained by one individual who is responsible for the facility and checks the facility periodically. This individual participates in a training program that is generally conducted by supervisory personnel. Likewise, this individual is relieved by other personnel for vacation time etc. and these relief personnel are trained before being allowed to perform operational duties unsupervised. Training "

Personnel are trained on these procedures and training includes periodic job observation. When equipment changes, maintenance training is conducted prior to maintenance being conducted. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Rosewood Dew Point facility conducts periodic audits to determine if practices and procedures required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Generally, the audit is conducted by supervisory personnel, hourly personnel and consultants as required. Audit team members will include individuals from other locations to assist in the audit. These audits are conducted at least every three years and are certified upon completion. Each compliance audit finding is tracked until completion and documentation of the two most recent audits is maintained at the facility. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nEnergy Transfer promptly investigates all incidents that results in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. Each investigation is conducted so that its root cause is determined and the investigation provides a direction to correct items so as to prevent the incident from reoccurring again. The incident investigation team will document all findings and recommendations which will be presented to Energy Transfer management.
