This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Aldora facility is a Responding facility for releases of RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe Continental Tire Aldora facility is located at 160 Aldora Street, Barnesville, GA, and is a textile converter for tire and hose products. The 888,000-square-foot facility produces tire cord fabric used in the production at Continental Tire Aldora (CTA) and General Brand Passenger and Light Truck (PLT) lineup. The Facility operations currently include twisting, weaving, treating, winding, and knitting processes.  The Facility uses natural gas or LPG heat to adhere various chemical mixtures onto raw yarns in its treating processes. \n\nThe Facility stores and handles an EPA Risk Management Program (RMP)-regulated chemical, Ammonia solution (29%), in quantities exceeding the threshold quantity of 20,000 lbs, therefore the facility is subject to EPA RMP regulatory requirements. \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nAldora plant has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nSafety Information [40 CFR Part 68.48]\nCTA maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nHazard Review [40 CFR Part 68.50]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-if/Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.52]\nTo ensure safe operations, CTA maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.54]\nCTA has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.56]\nCTA carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized tr"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.58]\nCTA conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP  are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years, and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.60]\nCTA promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe facility\u0092s RMP process is new and therefore have had no accidents.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nThe CTA retains a written site-specific formal emergency action plan (EAP), which includes the designated actions the company and all personnel will take to ensure personal safety from fire, unwanted releases of highly hazardous chemicals, and other emergencies.  The intent of this plan is to facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary and to account for all personnel.  The emergency plan also includes procedures for handling small releases. This facility is a non-responding facility and relies on the Local Fire Department to respond to chemical releases. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nCTA are continually improving and implementing their RMP program and safety systems. There is a process in place for the management team to review all potential process changes, including recommendations following process hazard analysis and compliance audits.  \n\nCTA has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activi"
