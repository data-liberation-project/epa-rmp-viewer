      "SummaryText": "W.H. Braum, Inc. (Braum's) operates an ice cream and dairy processing facility (Facility) in Tuttle, Oklahoma.  Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at the Facility for cooling the building, making ice, and freezing products.  This Facility complies with the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15 for the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is the policy of Braum's to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.     Braum's has in place policies which limit the amount of ammonia at the Facility.  Additionally, Braum's has prevention and management programs which are implemented to increase the safe operation of both systems.  Braum's believes that safe operations and accident prevention is the way to do business everyday.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is Braum's policy to notify the City of Tuttle Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In the past five years, the Facility has not had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.   The maximum amount of ammonia stored is 15550 pounds in the receiver.  The worst-case scenario for ammonia is a failure of the receiver and release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period.  Based on USEPA's lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is 2.2 miles.  Approximately 270 people live within the 2.2 mile radius from the Facility.  Topographic maps and visual receptor surveys indicated the area has other Braum's operations and residences within this area.  The alternative release scenario for ammonia is a \"pull-away\" failure during filling operations when the most that would be released is the contents of the filling hose (approximately 3\" dia. x 25').  Using the USEPA's look-up tables, the conservative distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles."
