This includes procedures for emergency response.\n\nThe 52nd Street facility, located at 5005 East McDowell Road in Phoenix, Arizona, is currently involved in the production of semiconductor components.  Trichlorosilane (TCS) is used to form a very thin layer of silicon on a substrate surface.  As mentioned, the accident prevention program will apply to the storage and delivery of TCS, until  the production area,  including the tank, is closed.  Other 112(r)-regulated substancs are present at the facility but at quantities which are below the threshold.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion of the entire tank capacity, 6000 gallons (the tank is not normally filled to capacity).  The closest receptor is a gas manufacturer; there are some residences slightly further away but within the impact radius.  No controls or mitigation measures were considered in determining the worst case impact distance.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves release of 4000 pounds of TCS from the fill truck into the truck containment area.  This event is assumed to be followed by a pool fire.  It is assumed that the entire truck contents (4000 pounds) are spilled into the containment.  The material is assumed to be contained within the diked area surrounding the truck fill station.  There are no receptors located within the distance to the endpoint for the alternative release scenario.  No reasonable alternative release scenario was found to have an off-site impact.\n\nThe TCS system is subject to EPA's Accident Prevention Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.  Highlights of the prevention program elements include:  a dike around the  tank, piping system which includes secondary containment in some areas, a relief "

Those that do have received the appropriate training and work closely with more experienced, Motorola employees.\n\nThere have been no releases of TCS which resulted in death, injury or significant property damage, within the last five years.  \n\nAs mentioned, Motorola maintains and follows a \"Disaster and Emergency\" plan, which addresses procedures to be used in case of an emergency release.  The emergency response program involves coordination with the local emergency responders.  This includes joint training and drills with the local fire department.\n\nBecause the TCS system has an excellent safety history, Motorola has no current plans to improve safety of the TCS system."
