Newell's (UNFI) implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance  program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both Pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC)to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. W. Newell has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions taken to minimize potential for recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting compliance audits to ensure the PSM program is being implemented. Lastly the PSM program incorporates the facility's emergency response  plan and places special emphasis on the handling of accidental releases of ammonia and the coordination of emergency response activities with the local fire authority and other response agencies.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at UNFI - Champaign, IL are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Champaign Fire Department which provide our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nUNFI - Champaign, IL utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at UNFI - Champaign, IL. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia that is expected to be present in this system is 12,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nUNFI - Champaign, IL has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA, and the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. UNFI - Champaign, IL is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nUNFI - Champaign, IL keeps comprehensive Process Safety Information (PSI) documentation for the ammonia refrigeration system. This PSI assists the employee operators and outside contractors in understanding the ammonia refrigeration system so they can operate "

PSI is available to all employees.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if/Checklist Study. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis is also revalidated when there is an extensive change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nUNFI - Champaign, IL maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nUNFI - Champaign, IL has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees involved in the process receive basic training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nUNFI - Champaign, IL carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices. Furt"
