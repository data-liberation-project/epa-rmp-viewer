The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of State and Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  This filing is to satisfy the regulatory required 5 year update.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe City of Nevada City's  Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 650 Jordan St., Nevada City, CA in Nevada County, and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for these RS's.  The facility is located in a ravine at the edge of town.  There are 4 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on trunions or ton container scales inside the building.  The chlorine can be used for odor control of the influent wastewater and is used to disinfect the wastewater effluent.  The sulfur "

Liquified pressurized gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum and converted to gas at vacuum regulator valves mounted directly onto the ton containers' gas valve.  From there, the gases (under vacuum) are metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators or sulfonators located in a separate room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through injectors.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Nevada City that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide  to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Nevada City has: \n\n       Gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; \n\n       Performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; \n\n       Performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; \n\n       Established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and \n\n       Established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the City of Nevada City are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.

The program and document mangement procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, improving seismic restraint of the ton container scale frames.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in recordable injuries or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe City of Nevada City's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with Nevada County Department of Environmental Health, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  Nevada City wastewater treatment plant is a non-responding facility and maintains an emergency action plan per California General industrial Service Order 3220.  Its plan consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies, and evacuation of persons on site to designated assembly areas upwind and uphill of the released gas.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis and audits which the City of Nevada City committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.
