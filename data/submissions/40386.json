      "SummaryText": "1.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nMarine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Pendleton is the United States Marine Corps? largest amphibious assault training facility. MCB Camp Pendleton covers an area of approximately 125,000 acres and is populated by over 40,000 military personnel and civilian employees in addition to numerous military dependents. MCB Camp Pendleton provides its own water supply and wastewater treatment facilities within its boundaries. Disinfection is therefore necessary to reduce the potential for transmission of infectious diseases. Chlorination has long been the accepted and preferred method of disinfection for both water and wastewater in the United States. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure during handling and to protect the health of persons on MCB Camp Pendleton and in the surrounding communities.\n\n1.1    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nPrevention of accidental releases for the MCB Camp Pendleton chlorine systems is dependent on developed chlorine handling procedures, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facilities, and staff training.  MCB Camp Pendleton facilities have been assessed against the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 55 ? Storage, Use and Handling of Compressed and Liquefied Gases in Portable Cylinders, and it is Base policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The buildings are clearly marked ?Danger Chlorine? to reduce unauthorized entry. Each chlorine system is enclosed in a locked building and access is restricted to authorized employees and contractors.  \nThe accidental release protection for the chlorine systems also involves a prevention program that includes the following:\n?    Documenting process safety information regarding the hazards of chlorine and components of the system;\n?    Conducting a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to evaluate poten"

Conducting a pre-startup review;\n?    Conducting compliance audits;\n?    Conducting incident investigations;\n?    Implementing an employee participation program; \n?    Implementing a hot work permit program; and\n?    Implementing a contractor safety program.\nAn Emergency Response Program has been developed to respond to any chlorine release scenario. Emergency response actions involve the system operators and maintenance staff, the Base Fire Department, and off-site expertise from the San Diego County Hazardous Incident Response Team (HIRT), when necessary. In addition, the Assistant Chief of Staff, Environmental Security (AC/S, Env Scty) or an appointed representative serves as the focal point for notifying the appropriate agencies and providing information to the public.\n\n1.2    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nChlorine stored in 150-pound cylinders and one-ton containers is used for disinfection at wastewater treatment facilities under Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program Level 3. The one-ton containers have an administrative fill limit of 1,200 pounds. Table 1-1 identifies Program Level 3 chlorine facilities at MCB Camp Pendleton, provides a description of the process, and lists the maximum amount of chlorine in the system.  Facilities that have been removed from the revised RMP are listed in Table 1-2.  Other chlorine facilities exist at MCB Camp Pendleton and they are described in two other RMP Public Documents - Program Levels 1 and 2.\n\nTable 1-1.

The buildings containing the systems have been evaluated against NFPA 55 and the Uniform Building Code. As a result, several system or building upgrades are being planned or considered (see Section 1.7 for more details).\nMCB Camp Pendleton has developed a prevention program that includes the following elements:\n?    Documenting process safety information regarding the hazards of chlorine and components of the system;\n?    Conducting a PHA to evaluate potential mechanical failures or operational causes that could result in an accidental release;\n?    Implementing written standard operating procedures;\n?

      "SummaryText": "DENT HISTORY\nCalARP regulations require facilities to compile a five-year accident history. This is defined as ?all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage? (California Code of Regulations [CCR], Title 19, Chapter 4.5, Section 2750.9). According to information provided by the Base Fire Department and AC/S, Env Scty, there have been no accidental releases from the Program Level 3 chlorine systems that meet the above definition since the original RMP was issued on 21 June 1999.\n\n1.6    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the existing management system (see Appendix A) for responding to emergencies, the appropriate discovery and notification procedures, and coordination with the HIRT. The operators and maintenance staff from the Facilities Maintenance Department (FMD) have been trained as Facilities Responders to report accidental releases to the Base Fire Department.  The Base Fire Department subsequently notifies HIRT for emergency response actions if needed.  The AC/S, Env Scty plays an active role in notifying the appropriate government agencies and communicating releases to the public.\n\n1.7    PLANNED UPGRADES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nUpgrades to improve safety of several of the Program Level 3 chlorine systems were being considered or planned at the time of this document?s initial preparation and submittal.  These changes are summarized in Table 1-3.  \n\nTable 1-3. Summary of Planned Safety Feature Upgrades\nBuilding/Process Number        Safety Feature        Date of Implementation*\n17831        Upgrade system to remove gaseous chlorination        August 2004\n*  Date of implementation planned as of June 2004, subject to funding availability.\n\nLast Revised:  21 June 2004"
