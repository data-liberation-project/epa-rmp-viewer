The City treat these plants by using the chemicals chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Over the past five years the City has not had any chemical accidents or chemical injuries.  It is the position of the City to maintain a well trained plant staff and a well trained hazardous material response team for the purpose of ensuring full compliance with all federal and state laws that deal with chemical releases.  The plant staff is trained monthly and the hazardous material team is trained daily.  The City has entrusted to the Huntsville Fire Department the responsibility to handle chemical spills and chemical releases thru it's Hazardous Material Response Team.\n\nThe purpose of the Cities Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of the general public, city employees, the environment (clean air & water),  and all emergency personnel who must work around the plants before and during a chemical release.  The City recognize the importance of preventing releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide into the environment and therefore have designed a plan of action to prevent releases and have written it's plan in Manuel \"Standard Operating Procedures for Chemical Spills and Chemical Releases\".  This plan was designed to have a road map to manage and control all release.\n\nThe responsibility of responding to releases at the cities four plants lay with the Hazardous Material Response Team from The Huntsville Fire Department.  The City, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Huntsville Fire Department has designed and developed a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) that will be placed into action if and when we every have a chemical release at any one of the four plants.  The Huntsville Police Department will handle all 24 hour calls for all reported releases.  The Huntsville Fire Department w"

The SOP was designed to follow the EPA guidelines ( 40 CFR part 68.10) and all existing regulatory requirements.\n\nThe City has not had a spill history of any releases as a result of using or handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The City has established an annual training and re-training program for the Hazardous Material Response Team and the City has provided funds to buy and maintain the equipment needed to hand any chemical releases at the plants.  The City of Huntsville is committed to the protection of lives, the environment, and property.  The City has a small overall usage of chemicals and we are commented to the EPA Clean Air and Water Acts."
