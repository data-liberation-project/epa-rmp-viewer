We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Greenville believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Operations and Maintenance Guidelines (OMGs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe City of Greenville has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, maintenance crews, and fire department to be first responders to a release.  The training included three days of classroom and hands on training on the proper use of emergency response equipment and procedures.  The course followed the guidelines stated in OSHA 1910.120.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Waste Reclamation Center utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\nChemical                             Maximum Inventory (lb)                    Threshold Quantity (lb)\nChlorine                                      16,"

A dense-gas dispersion model (SLAB) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  A dense-gas model is required since both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are heavier than air.  The model's input parameters are summarized in the table below.\n\nSLAB Input Parameters\n                                                                  Worst-Case Scenario                 Alternative Scenario\nWindspeed (m/s)                                                       1.5                                               3\nAtmospheric Stability Class                                         F                                                D\nTemperature (0 F)                                                     104                                             104\nHumidity (%)                                                               50                                               50\nHeight of Release (m)                                                   0                                                 1\nSurface Roughness                                                     1                                                 1\n                                                                             Chlorine                                   Sulfur Dioxide\nEnd Points (mg/l)                                                    0.0087                                           0.0078\n\nThe results of the air dispersion model are summarized in the table below along with the estimated population within the impact area.
