This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nRegulated materials are received from various suppliers and stored in containers.  These containers meet DOT specifications.  All storage and ancillary equipment is designed to comply with National Standards including the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Fertilizer Institute, National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Chlorine Institute, and OSHA.\n\nHydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance.  Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards.  All processes are subject to the OSHA PSM program and as such, undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemical, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are"

This Plan is integrated into the Local Emergency Planning Committees' (LEPC's) county wide plan.  The Plan is reviewed and updated as required.  Emergency Responders receive formal training on the Plan annually.  The Plan includes:\n\nA? Actions facility personnel must take in the event of fire, explosion or  release\n\nA? Arrangements with the local and state governments in the event of an accident\n\nA? Names, addresses and telephone numbers of all emergency responders\n\nA? Necessary emergency equipment and how it is to be implemented\n\nA? Resources available at the plant for use in responding such as \n     chemical resistant suits, \n     self-contained breathing apparatus, \n     two way radios for communication, \n     gas monitors, and \n     repair kits for leaking cylinders and tanks.  \n\nHydrite Chemical is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility and continually works to improve processes or procedures that advance our goal of zero releases."
