      "SummaryText": "The chlorination facility at the City?s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was designed and constructed in 1992 and employs the use of chlorine to disinfect the total facility effluent as well as providing chlorine solution for filamentous control and algae control at the secondary clarifiers.  The overall system consists of the chlorine storage and handling, gas withdrawal, process piping, chlorinators, chlorine injection, and the chlorine solution distribution panel.  During normal operation, standard one-ton cylinders are delivered to the facility by truck.  A total of sixteen cylinders are at the plant at any given time.  Three of the cylinders are used in the operation at the same time and the gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinders under pressure to the vacuum regulators.  From here a submersible inductor located in the chlorine mixing chamber runs continuously creating a vacuum, which pulls chlorine from a chlorinator.\n\nThe dechlorination facility at the WWTP was built at the same time as the chlorination system and employs the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to neutralize the chlorine residual in the facility effluent.  The overall system is very similar to the chlorination system and consists of the SO2 storage and handling, gas withdrawal, process piping, sulfonators, and sulfur dioxide injectors.  During normal operation, standard one-ton cylinders are delivered to the facility by truck.  A total of six cylinders are at the plant at any given time.  Two of the cylinders are in operation at a time and gaseous SO2 is withdrawn from the one-ton cylinder under pressure to the vacuum regulators.  From this point on, the SO2 gas is transported via vacuum to sulfonators and injectors, where it is combined into water solution for the transport to the application point.  \n\nThere have been no releases or spills, of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, at the City of Yakima WWTP over this planning period or at any other time since the use of these chemicals was initiated"

      "SummaryText": ".  The WWTP Emergency Response (ER) plan has been recently reviewed and the steps to follow for an imminent or actual emergency are outlined and described in this document.  The ER plan includes: identification, notification of public and local emergency agencies, medical actions to deal with human exposures, procedures for using emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing, and maintenance; training for employees, identifying changes to ensure that employees are informed, and the procedures and measures for emergency response to contain or neutralize these specific chemicals.\n \nThe City of Yakima has the same containment and neutralization equipment for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The buildings that the chemicals are stored in are airtight.  In case of a spill, leak detection equipment triggers a vacuum, which pulls the gas down into troughs in the floor and injects the gas into the WWTP effluent.  In the case of a chlorine spill, sulfur dioxide is added to neutralize the chlorine. \n\nThe city is currently in the process of updating its Risk Management Plan (RMP).  A compliance audit is currently under way and a Process Hazard Analysis is scheduled for the Week of February 14-18, 2005.  When these are completed and assessed the RMP will be re-submitted to EPA.  Future plans to eliminate the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are also being developed by the City of Yakima?s Wastewater Division.  The city is currently having an Ultra Violet disinfection system designed by its engineer with construction beginning in approximately five years."
