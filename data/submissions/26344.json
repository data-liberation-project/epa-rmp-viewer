Chlorine is stored prior to and during use in 1-ton containers on a partially enclosed concrete pad. The chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquefied gas, and is released into wastewater using a vacuum-regulated system. The maximum intended chlorine inventory at the facility is 4,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.\n\nThe facility uses sulfur dioxide in the removal of chlorine from treated wastewater. Sulfur dioxide is stored in 1-ton containers and stored on a partially enclosed pad.  Two 1-ton containers are stored at the facility with one container in use at any given time.  The sulfur dioxide is stored as a liquefied gas and released into wastewater using a vacuum-regulated system.  The amount of sulfur dioxide stored at the facility does not exceed the RMP threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are toxic chemicals and precautions must be taken in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to facility personnel and to reduce the threat of accidental release which might result in exposure to the surrounding community and to the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and industry rules, regulations, and guidelines. Chemical safety at the City of Rockport WWTP is dependent upon strict operating procedures, safe handling methods, and thorough training of employees. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety devices are also inherent in the design of the facility and in the equipment used in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemical processes.\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative-Release Scenario, Inc"

The alternative-case scenario is defined as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. The alternative-case scenario should also reach an offsite endpoint, unless no such scenario exists.\n\nAt the City of Rockport WWTP, the worst-case scenario for chlorine would result in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas. The impact radius would be 0.9-mile and affect 1,900 persons.  Public receptors would include schools, residences, hospitals, public recreation areas or arenas, and major commercial or industrial areas. There were no environmental receptors within the impact radius.\n\nThe alternative-case scenario for chlorine would result in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas.  The impact radius would be 0.2-mile and affect 78 persons.  Public receptors would include residences, hospitals, public recreation areas or arenas, and major commercial or industrial areas.

Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nSafety Information\n\nThe City of Rockport WWTP maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the wastewater disinfection process.\n\nHazard Review\n\nOur facility conducts detailed studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel and are revalidated at least once every five years. Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, the City of Rockport WWTP maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe City of Rockport WWTP has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees who are operating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are competent in the operations procedures associated with the processes.\n \nMaintenance\n\nThe City of Rockport WWTP conducts regular maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems,"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nThe City of Rockport WWTP conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe City of Rockport WWTP promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or know offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nThe City of Rockport WWTP employees will not respond to a chemical emergency at the plant. As required by 40 CFR 68.90, the City of Rockport WWTP is included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Rockport WWTP completed an equipment upgrade project in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes in November 2000.  The upgrade included development and implementation of chemical specific operating procedures, training procedures, and maintenance procedures.  The City of Rockport WWTP conti"
