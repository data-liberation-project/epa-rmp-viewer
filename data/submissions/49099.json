The City has developed and\nimplemented the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Prevention Program\nwhich provides a systematic approach to employee involvement, safety awareness,\nemergency response, risk management, and program assessment related to chlorine\nfacilities at the plant.\nPLANT DESCRIPTION\nThe Miramar Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was originality built in the early 1960's and\ntreats water for the northern portion of the City of San Diego and for sale to other\nagencies. The Miramar Water Treatment Plant has a maximum water treatment capacity\nof 140 million gallons per day (MGD), with a future capital improvement project goal of\nexpanding capacity to 215 MGD. The Miramar Water Treatment Plant is located\nadjacent to the south shore of Lake Miramar Reservoir in a predominantly residential\narea in the northern portion of the City of San Diego. The surrounding terrain is relatively\nhilly. Currently, there is significant amount of existing residential development to the\nsouth, west, and east of the facility, and there is a significant amount of existing\ncommercial development to the west of the facility. The Miramar WTP currently uses\nchlorine to disinfect water from Miramar Reservoir and the California Aqueduct, making\nit suitable for use in the City of San Diego's drinking water distribution system and for\nsale to other agencies. The chlorine is received in one-ton pressurized liquid containers\nat the secured Chlorine Storage Room of the Chlorine Building. The Chlorine Storage\nroom is equipped to store a maximum"

Upgrades have been continually made in order to\nimprove the safety of the chlorine process equipment. The most recent upgrades were\nimplemented in 2005 (see Table 3-1 in Section 3).\nCOMMITMENT\n1\nThe Miramar Water Treatment Plant has a well trained and committed operations and\nmaintenance staff with a record of over 40 years of using chlorine safely. To support the\nefforts of continued safe handling and use of chlorine at the Miramar Water Treatment\nPlant, senior management has committed to the development of a comprehensive Process\nSafety Management Program under the guidelines of State and Federal mandates which\nhas involved complete engineering reviews of the chlorine storage and feed system and\ndesign certification.\nPROGRAM COMPLIANCE\nThe Risk Management Prevention and Process Safety Management Programs have been\ndeveloped and implemented. The Risk Management Prevention Program is in fulfillment\nof the requirements of 40 CFR PART 68 within Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act\nand the California Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations(Title 19, Chapter\n4.5 of the California Code of Regulations). The Process Safety Management Program is\nin fulfillment of the Occupational Health and Safety Administrations (OSHA) 1910.119,\nas well as Cal/OSHAs California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5189, Process\nSafety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials.\nAs with the use of any hazardous chemicals, the use of chlorine in this treatment process\nposes the potential for an accidental release that could have offsite consequences. It is for\nthis reason that several years ago, under the provisions of the Risk Management Program\nRule (40 CFR PART 68), an assessment of potential offsite consequences of accidental\nrelease scenarios of chlorine to the surrounding environment was conducted at the\nMiramar Water Treatment Plant. Under the provisions of the rule, the treatment process\nat t"

Incorporated into the Risk Management Plan (RMP) was\nthe analysis of potential offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release. This\nanalysis produces information related to the residential population and public and\nenvironmental receptors which may be affected in the event of a accidental chlorine\nrelease.\nSAFETY ELEMENTS\nSafety elements can be defined as either administrative or engineering controls.\nAdministrative elements include; 1) procedural requirements, 2) training, 3) operator\ncertification, and 4) the City?s policy and commitment of resources. Engineering\nelements include physical modifications or facilities to 1) detect, 2) contain, 3) treat, 4)\nwarn, and/or 5) eliminate a potential incident. The following engineering upgrades were\nmade to enhance the management and mitigation of an accidental chlorine release (see\nTable 3-1 in Section 3 for dates of implementation/review):\n1) Chlorine leak detection sensors were installed in the chlorine container storage\nbuilding and feed system. These sensors activate alarms within the plant when low levels\nof chlorine are detected within the Chlorine Storage Building.\n2\n2) A computerized process control program allows the Duty Plant Operator to see\nimmediately from the Operations Control Room what part of the chlorine feed system is\nalarming, (and at what chlorine concentration) without leaving the control room.\n3) An automatic chlorine shut-off system was installed to minimize a chlorine release by\nenabling the operator to stop the chlorine feed at the cylinder in the event of a release.\n4) An automatic switchover system was installed, which allows for the automated\nswitchover from the two on-line containers to the two standby containers\nThe following administrative safety controls have been implemented:\n1) Several"

The Miramar Water Treatment Plant, in conjunction with the\nWater Department Emergency Management Coordinator, have developed and tested a\nChlorine Emergency Response Plan. The Chlorine Emergency Response Plan was\ndeveloped to support the Water Plant staff in the event of a chlorine release in which\nadditional resources are required to mitigate the situation. The San Diego Fire\nDepartment?s Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team (HIRT) is dedicated to\nrespond to the plant in the event of an incident which exceeds the response capabilities of\nthe plant staff. The Miramar Water Treatment Plant maintains a Business Plan that\nidentifies evacuation points on the site and provides additional emergency information\nabout chlorine and additional contacts if needed. All personnel assigned to this site are\ntrained and certified on the provisions of this Business Plan.\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn the last five years, one reportable incident related to a chlorine release has occurred at\nthe Miramar Water Treatment Plant. This incident, which occurred in 2002, resulted in no\noffsite consequences, and the worker involved suffered only minor injuries. The City\nmaintains comprehensive Incident Investigation and Emergency Response Programs in\nthe event of an incident. Ongoing Emergency Response training and operator and staff\ncertification assure that plant personnel maintain familiarity with safety and emergency\nprocedures and available emergency response resources.\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance audit was conducted by an outside\nconsultant in 2005 in accordance with applicable Cal-OSHA regulations, specifically\nParagraph (0), 8 CCR, ? 5189 of Cal-OSHA.

Additional support will be provided by the San Diego Fire Department?s\nHazardous Materials Incident Response Team (HIRT). In the event HIRT is required,\nplant staff can mobilize all necessary resources with a single radio or telephone call. In\naddition, an automated dialing system has been installed. This system automatically\ncontacts relevant responders (HIRT and/or plant staff) in the event that a chlorine\nconcentration threshold is detected by the gas sensors in the Chlorine Room. All relevant\ndesign and operations of chlorine facilities at Miramar WTP have received thorough\nreview by the Fire Department prior to construction or implementation. Fire Department\nstaff have worked closely with plant staff to develop a thorough familiarity with the\noperation of chlorine facilities in order to facilitate efficient emergency response.\nPLANNED CHANGES\nThe Miramar Water Treatment Plant has received numerous engineering upgrades\nthroughout the last decade. Facilities planned or currently in construction including:\n1. Additional video monitoring of chemical storage and feed facilities.\n2. Installation of a `scrubber? system, capable of neutralizing 2000 pounds of\nchlorine. The operation of the scrubber may be activated by installed leak\ndetection equipment or may be initiated manually by staff.\n3. Construction of a new chlorine room designed as a containment structure,\neliminating free discharge of chlorine to the atmosphere\nThe City of San Diego Water Department and the Miramar Plant staff are committed to\nproviding `state of the art? facilities that produce high quality drinking water while\nprotecting the environment and the health and safety of plant staff and the public.\n4"
