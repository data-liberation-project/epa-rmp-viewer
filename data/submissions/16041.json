      "SummaryText": "\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Tracy Fresh Water Treatment Plant (FWTP) handles chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material.  The properties of the material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe chlorine gas is used to disinfect water treated at the FWTP, to disinfect water pumped from the associated wells into the City's water distribution system, and to disinfect the water in the City's swimming pool.  Chlorine is delivered in one-ton containers for use at the FWTP, and is delivered to the Chlorine Storage Area at the FWTP.  The one-ton containers are used at this location.\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the regulated substance is considered as part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe one-ton chlorine container is the largest vessel in the chlorine system located at the FWTP.  The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one-ton chlorine container assumes that the full 2,000 pounds of chlorine is released over a ten-minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is 1.3 miles.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for chlorine for the one-ton container located at the FWTP assumes a release from a valve packing, resulting in an estimated release of no more than 2 pounds per hour"

      "SummaryText": ".  The period of release is taken to be one hour in duration, resulting in a total release quantity of 2 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.1 mile.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to prevent a release from occurring.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine system and the training provided to the chlorine operators.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to prevent a release from occurring.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represent one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Tracy Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.

      "SummaryText": "Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) program that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the chlorine system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental release of the regulated substances."
