Foods, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  O. K. Foods strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Muldrow Fire Department and the Sequoyah Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 61,250 pounds.  We have the capacity for more but do not run above 70% of total capacity.\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "OLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of our largest receiver.  O. K. Foods\u00bf policy restricts the maximum capacity of this 35,877 pound tank to 70% of capacity.  The greatest amount stored in that tank is 25,254 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source.  \nDistance to endpoint: 2.0 miles \n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure release valve.  The emergency valves shut-down release would engage and stop the flow or an alarm would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 60 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 2,262 pounds of ammonia.  \nDistance to endpoint:  0.11 miles (189 yards)\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nO.K. Foods had a reportable release anhydrous ammonia occurred on December 29, 2005 at 9:30 p.m.  The release approximately 10 minutes in duration and was from a compressor due to operator error.  Approximately 150 pounds were released during an oil/liquid ammonia/ammonia gas spill.\n\nApproximately 140 employees were evacuated from the facility building to an area of the facility site upwind of the release.  The local fire department notified approximately 40 residences in the area of the facility and one individual was evacuated from the area for a short time.  All others were believed to have remained in their residences.\n\nFollowing the release, 21 employees were transported to local hospitals.  Of these, two were admitted.  One was the refrigeration technician that was performing maintenance on the compressor when the release occurred.  The other was an employee that was admitted for observation because of medical history.  All others were examined, treated as needed and released.\n\n\n5.

Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Sequoyah County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Muldrow Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe O. K. Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom and On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are given written and oral testing and are observed by senior maintenance staff and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.\n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe work very closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Muldrow Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCurrently, O. K. Foods trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed and updated annually.  Our program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available."
