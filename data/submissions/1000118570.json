Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require precautions and procedures to be in place to protect team members and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of BrucePac to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent in the way anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan developed in compliance with the Emergency Action Plan provisions of OAR 437-002-0042 .\n\n1.20 Facility Description and Substances Handled\nBrucePac is a manufacturing facility that processes, stores, and distributes meat products. Production requires a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the processed foods. This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized team members, management personnel, and contractors. \nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum inventory in the ammonia refrigeration system is 49,266 pounds. No standby make-up inventory is kept on-site.\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Com"

This system estimates the residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. In addition, it lists whether certain types of public and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nBrucePac complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility were in accordance with published standards, tests, or recommended methods of trade, industry, or governmental organizations.\n\nBrucePac's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure the safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to the safe operation of the refrigeration system include team member participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the BrucePac safety representative and Director of Mechanical Systems.\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each team member involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA). Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system. This minimizes the chances of inadvertent errors in operation that could lead to the release of ammonia.

It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA Emergency Response regulations, OAR 1910.120. The Emergency Evacuation Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been reviewed with the Woodburn Fire District.\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at BrucePac and establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia-release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n\u0095\tEmergency Alarm and Communication System\n\u0095\tEmergency Response Team\n\u0095\tEvacuation Plans and Assembly Points\n\u0095\tPersonal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Woodburn Fire District.\n\nAll BrucePac personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the BrucePac Safety Manager.\n\n1.70 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will comply with those standards applicable at that tim"

These recommendations are scheduled to be completed by July 2025. \nMany of the prioritized recommendations from the March 2023 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) have been addressed. The remaining items will be completed by 3/31/2025."
