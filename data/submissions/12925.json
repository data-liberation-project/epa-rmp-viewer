The site is approximately 150 acres in size and was originally an Army Corp of Engineers barge repair facility during the 1930's.  During the 1970's the site manufactured agricultural chemicals for Chemform, Inc. In 1981, CPS Chemical Co. acquired the site and originally had 10 employees.  The site grew to 240 employees by 1997 when CPS was purchased by Allied Colloids.  Ciba Specialty Chemical Co. acquired the site in 1998 with the purchase of Allied Colloids.The site was used by CPS and later Allied Colloids and now Ciba for the production of water treatment chemicals.   \n\n1.2) Ciba's Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies \n\nCiba has established an Emergency Response Team (ERT) composed of experienced chemical operators and shift supervisors who are trained to respond to an accidental release, fire, spill, or other emergency at the West Memphis site. In accordance with 29 CFR 1910, Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response (Hazwoper) training requirements, all employees receive Awareness Level training. Chemical operators receive Technician Level training and shift supervisors receive Incident Command Level training. The site ERT operates under the same Incident Command Structure as the West Memphis Fire Department (Designated Mutual Aid Provider).\n\nIf an incident requires the site's Emergency Response Team to be activated, the incident commander will determine if the West Memphis Fire Department should be notified. Ciba  ensures that local authorities are made aware of our efforts to continuously improve the West Memphis site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) through annual site inspections and walk through reviews"

Both of these products are produced as solutions in water.  These monomers and polymers are used in water treatment applications, for removing color and solids from drinking water, and in paper making.  There are two RMP regulated chemicals used in P1 in excess of the threshold quantities, dimethylamine  (DMA) and epichlorohydrin (EPI).  Dimethylamine (DMA) is stored in tank farm 700 north of the P3 production area. Starting in August of 1999, epichlorohydrin (EPI) will also be stored in tank farm 700 in a new storage facility which is currently under construction. \n\nDMA:  MQ* = 263,000 lb.\nEPI:  MQ = 281,000 lb.\n\n*  MQ = maximum quantity\n\nProduction area P2 produces the methacrylate monomer FM1 and the quaternary monomer salts of both FM1 and the acrylate monomer FA1.  Also produced here are DADMAC polymers made from P1 produced monomer.  The quaternary salts and polymers are all made and sold as solutions in water.  FM1 and FA1 quats are used in co-polymer applications for water treatment, in coatings, and as lube-oil additives.  There is one RMP covered chemical used in P2 in excess of the threshold quantity, methyl chloride (MeCl).  Starting in August of 1999, methyl chloride (MeCl) will be stored in a new tank located in tank farm 700 north of the P3 production area.\n\nMeCl:  MQ = 341,000 lb.\n\nProduction area P3 produces FA1 and the P-monomer products which are high purity acrylate and methacrylate monomers.  Also produced in P3 are glycidyl ethers and their intermediates. P-monomers are used in solventless ultraviolet (UV) cure coatings and in printing inks.  Glycidyl ethers are used in polysilicone manufacture. Typical uses are tub and tile caulks and automotive finishes"

Starting in August of 1999,  epichlorohydrin (EPI) will be stored in a new tank located in tank farm 700 north of the P3 production area.\n\nAA:  MQ = 304,000 lb.\nEPI:  MQ = 281,000 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0 ) Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenerios  \n\n3.1 ) Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances - allyl alcohol\n\nUsing EPA's recommended method of determining worse case weather and release conditions Ciba's offsite consequence analysis determined that the worst case toxic release scenario could have an impact area within an 8.1 mile radius from the site. This scenario was based on the failure or rupture of an entire railcar containing 180,000 lbs of allyl alcohol (AA), spilling all of its contents to the ground.  This unlikely event would cause an endpoint concentration of  0.036 mg/liter. The 8.1 mile radius should not be considered a public danger zone but is instead an estimate of the maximum possible distance that could be affected under these extreme, unlikely, and catastrophic conditions. \nThe endpoints specified by EPA for the regulated substances are intended to be protective of the general public. These endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed that nearly all people could be exposed for one half to one hour without any serious immediate or prolonged health effects. \n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe from occurring, rail cars are regularly pressure tested and inspected for damage as part of a rigorous preventative maintenance program mandated under Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations for the transport of hazardous materials. Rail cars are equipped with excess flow valves to automatically shut off the flow of material if a line or hose rupture occurs.

In addition, unloading lines are pressure checked before each unloading operation and replaced if damaged or worn out.\n\nAll transfer of material from rail cars is continuously monitored by chemical operators stationed at the unloading area. The rail sidings are isolated during transfers with hazard warning flags and stops to ensure that no other rail cars can approach a connected allyl alcohol rail car. Instrumentation, computer, and administrative controls are also in place to immediately isolate the storage tank and remotely stop the transfer of material should a leak develop. An existing fire water system includes the capability to suppress the spread of harmful vapors with a portable foam unit to minimize the effects of a leak. In addition, a major upgrade of  the facilities' fire water system is currently in construction which will include a 400,000 gal. fire water storage tank. The new fire water system will become operational during the Fall of  1999.\n\n3.2 ) Alternate Release of Toxic Substances - allyl alcohol\n\nUtilizing the same EPA guidance manual, an alternative, more realistic release scenario for allyl alcohol (AA) determined an impact distance of 0.19 miles for the same endpoint concentration. The alternative release scenario was based on the failure of a transfer hose which would release 200 lbs./ min. of allyl alcohol (AA) for about 10 minutes until the release could be stopped.  \n\n\n\n\n3.3\t) Other Alternate Releases of Toxic Substances\n\nAn alternative release scenario was also considered for each RMP regulated toxic chemical on site. The alternative release scenarios were based on process knowledge, accident history, and the process hazard analysis conducted for the unit.\n\nThe epichlorohydrin (EPI) alternative release scenario was based on the assumption that the rupture disc on a reactor releases material while at temperature during a reaction in P3.

The impact area would have a radius of less than 0.06 miles to an endpoint concentration of 0.82 mg/liter.\n\n3.4 ) Worst-Case Release for Flammable Substances - dimethyl amine\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis also considered the worst case flammable release scenario. This analysis used EPA's recommended method of determining worse case weather and release conditions to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint caused by a vapor cloud explosion. This endpoint is a conservative threshold for determining potential serious injuries to people as a result of property damage (e.g. flying glass and debris) as a result of an explosion. Ciba's consequence analysis indicated that the worst case flammable scenario could have an impact area within a 0.46 mile radius from the site. This scenario is based on the failure of a storage tank containing 244,000 lbs of dimethylamine (DMA). The 0.46 mile radius should not be considered a public danger zone but instead an estimate of the maximum possible distance that may be affected under extreme, unlikely and catastrophic conditions. \n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe from occurring, the following preventative measures are employed. The DMA storage tank is periodically inspected for corrosion and excessive wear. The tank is equipped with excess flow isolation valves, passive fire protective insulation, and a fire monitor which includes the capability to suppress the spread of harmful vapors with portable foam canisters to minimize the effects of a leak. DMA is pumped to point of use with sealed canned motor pumps which are periodically inspected for excessive bearing wear to ensure their continued integrity. \n\nDMA rail cars are regularly pressure tested and inspected for damage as part of a rigorous preventative maintenance program mandated under Department of Transportati"
