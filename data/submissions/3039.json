This plan is intended to prevent and minimize the impacts of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide inventories exceed the threshold quantities established in the Risk Management Plan Program (RMP) requirements.\n\nThe Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for chlorination and de-chlorination (disinfection) respectfully, of plant effluent.  The use of these chemicals are subject to the provisions of the RMP requirements, due to their \"above-threshold\" quantities.  \n\nPhysical Address     Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant\nS 1/2 of SE 1/4 of Section 6,\n        Township 20 North, Range 14 East of I.M., in Tulsa County, State of Oklahoma\nLatitude:    36'-14'-20\"N\n            Longitude:    95'-51'-15\"W\n\nMailing Address    Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant\n5665 N. 105th E.

No schools hospitals or large complexes are located within this radius.  The population estimate was calculated by using the Block Group Uniform Method, which determine the ratio of the circle to the land area of the block group polygons falling either partially or completely within the radius of the circle.  The ratio is then applied to the population statistics of these block groups to provide estimates for the area within the radius.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History    The City of Tulsa Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant has not had an accident involving the chlorine or sulfur dioxide systems which has resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan    The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that the Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains up-to-date and complete written emergency action plans (EAPs) and effective response capabilities for all covered processes.  Comprehensive emergency action plans, when combined with emergency response training and drills, can effectively minimize the impact of an accidental release by ensuring proper and quick facility response.  An summary of the requirements as outline in this section are as follows:\n* This facility shall investigate each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release.\n* This investigation shall be initiated promptly, no later than 48 hours following the incident.\n* The guidelines and reports included herein shall be followed for each incident.\n* The findings shall be reviewed by all affected personnel whose job tasks are affected by the findings.\n* Investigation summaries shall be retained for five years.\n\nKey Personnel in Plan Implementation\nContact\nPosition\nElement\nPhone Number\nJim Tweet\nNorthside"
