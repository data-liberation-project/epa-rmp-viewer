The main plant is located just within the Reedley city limit (northwest of town at Reed and South Avenues).  A maintenance facility is located just outside of the city limit to the northeast of Reedley on Buttonwillow and South Avenues.  The refrigeration facility includes a pre-cooler and cold storage warehouse with 2,500 tons of cooling capacity for storage and shipment of produce.  The original ammonia based refrigeration system was erected in 1972 and the existing facility was completely updated and expanded in 1984.

By virtue of the hazardous and flammable effects associated with ammonia and propane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the treat to our own personal health as well as the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  We are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  Safety at the Ito facility depends upon the manner in which we handle hazardous substances as well as on the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the equipment.  Furthermore, comprehensive training received by employees adds to the inherent safety of the distribution facility.\n\nOur Risk Management Program (RMP) is based upon the federal standard outlined in OSHA's Process Safety Management (OSHA 3132) and NPGA's LP-Gas Safety Handbook / Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures / How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires / OTHER STANDARD  or GUIDELINE.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia or propane, if a release does occur, we will coordinate with the Reedley City and Fresno County Fire Dept, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nThe intent of Ito Packing Company is to maintain only one Risk Management program which will include the requirements of OSHA, EPA and Cal ARP.

PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is acutely hazardous and propane a flammable material as defined by the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA 40 CFR 68.  The threshold quantity for these materials is established in appendix A of OSHA 1910.119 at 10,000-pounds.  The CalARP program establishes a 500-pound \n\nthreshold quantity.  The Ito Packing Company system is thus subject to the requirements of both the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, the Process Safety Management Standard and the Cal ARP requirements.\n\nThe two materials are 72,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is required for the operation of the cold storage units; and 80,000 lbs of propane, which is used strictly for filling the fuel tanks of forklifts and ranch vehicles.\n\nThe ammonia storage/receiver tank is located in a secured area authorized for technicians only.  The propane is stored in 2 tanks on the eastside of the plant and access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees and management personnel.  Both products are received via truck from authorized and trained distributors.\n\n3.  The Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\nIto Packing Company has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information\nIto Packing Company maintains a detailed record of written safety information, which describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipments designs associated with all aspects of our distribution facility.\n\nHazard Review\nA checklist methodology is used to carry out hazard reviews at our facility.  The reviews focus on operating procedures, equipment functions and han"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with extensive knowledge of facility operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Ito Packing Company maintains written operating procedures, computerized monitoring of ammonia refrigeration systems and various alarm functions.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nIto Packing Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided periodically (at least every 3 years), when certification requires, or change warrants.\n\nMaintenance\nIto Packing Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functioning.  Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in these practices.  Furthermore, personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nIto Packing Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\nIto Packing Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\nIto Packing Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of ammonia or propane.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nOur facility's emergency response plan is based upon the OSHA PSM and EPA's RMP, compliance standard, IIAR Guide to Good Practices, MSDS for anhydrous ammonia and propane,\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
