This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Non-essential personnel will be evacuated to more remote locations outside the main refinery.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, butane, pentane, propane, and flammable mixtures.  In addition, the refinery uses aqueous ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance.  Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated; hydrogen sulfide, anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and mercaptans do not exceed their respective threshold quantities and therefore are not reported.\r\n\r\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\r\n\r\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes.  The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery, and is designed to remove salt and sediment from raw crude oil then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products.  The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator tower and the vacuum tower.  Negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum) is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.  The Crude Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.  The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 74,000 pounds (lbs). \r\n\r\n#1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit\r\n\r\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Unit c"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes, to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) performed at Cherry Point will be via either hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) or What-If Checklist studies.  The HAZOP and What-If Checklist processes are based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals work separately and combine results.  The PHA team is comprised of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise brought together to thoroughly review the process hazards through collective brainstorming.\r\n\r\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures is tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, tracked to completion, and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Through the management of change process, these procedures are kept current and accurately maintained.  \r\n\r\nThis information is readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use, as necessary, to perform their job tasks safely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operation.  \r\n\r\nNew employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition to initial training, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  \r\n\r\nAll of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  A modern, up-to-date, fully programmable computer-driven simulator, with display panels identical to those used in the control room, is also available in the larger units for employees to practice unit operations.  The simulators are fully functional and can duplicate all unit characteristics, and can also be used to simulate proposed changes to determine whether safety parameters could be vi"

The ICS has a hierarchical (i.e., chain-of-command) structure that places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.  The Emergency Manger is a liaison between the Incident Commander, the public, and the Company.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position within the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, defined in the ERP.
