This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe crude unit consists of two basic processes: thermal fractionation and vacuum fractionation. The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery. It is designed to take raw crude oil, remove salt and sediment, heat and factionate the crude into finished and intermediate products. The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator (VDF) tower and the vacuum tower. Negative pressure, a vacuum, is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe purpose of the #2 Reformer is to convert the low octane gasoline feed fractions from the Naphtha HDS and Hydrocracking units into stabilized high octane blending stock. This is accomplished through the use of catalyst under high temperatures and a hydrogen atmosphere.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Unit #26 is designed to process 18,000 BPD of diesel feed and to operate at 850 psig. The design basis provides for a \"future case\" where the unit can process cracked feedstocks at more severe conditions although numerous modifications will still need to be made to do this. As currently designed, the unit will process straight run diesel feeds from the crude unit. The ULSD process combines hydrogen with the straight run diesel feeds, and processes them in a high pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst. The reaction produces H2S, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing. The amine/H2S mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur. The unit is expected to consume 6-7 MMSCFD of 220 psig  hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 ppm to less than 15 ppm.",

However, if a\n\nrelease does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nThe #3 Diesel Hydrodesulfurization Unit #27 is designed to process 12,300 BPD of light coker gas oil and 14,600 BPD of diesel feed and to operate at 750 psig. As currently designed, the unit will process light coker gas oil feed from the Coker Unit, and straight run diesel feeds from the crude unit and vacuum diesel fractionator. The DHDS process combines hydrogen with the straight run diesel feeds, and processes them in a high pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst. The reaction produces H2S, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed\n\nfrom the process through amine scrubbing. The amine/H2S mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant\n\nand processed into molten sulfur. The unit is expected to consume 12.8 MMSCFD of 1,226 psig hydrogen and is\n\ndesigned to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 ppm to less than 15 ppm.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Non-essential personnel will be evacuated to more remote locations outside the main refinery.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, butane, pentane, propane, and flammable mixtures.  In addition, the refinery uses aqueous ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance.  Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated; hydrogen sulfide, anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and mercaptans do not exceed their respective threshold quantities and therefore are not reported.\n\n\n\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\n\n\n\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes.  The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery, and is designed to remove salt and sediment from raw crude oil then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products.  The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator tower and the vacuum tower.  Negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum) is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.  The Crude Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.  The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 74,000 pounds (lbs). \n\n\n\n#1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit\n\n\n\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Unit c"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes, to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) performed at Cherry Point will be via either hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) or What-If Checklist studies.  The HAZOP and What-If Checklist processes are based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals work separately and combine results.  The PHA team is comprised of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise brought together to thoroughly review the process hazards through collective brainstorming.\n\n\n\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures is tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, tracked to completion, and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
