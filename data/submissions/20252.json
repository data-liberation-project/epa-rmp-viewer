COGDILL\nPhone:        1-712-674-3344\n\n     1.    Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of COGDILL FARM SUPPLY, INC. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.\n    If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n    \n2.    Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application  for crop production nutrients.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia and  propane is stored at the facility; in one 18000 gal storage tank used for anhydrous, and four 1000 gal tanks used for propone, which are stored at the facility for the purpose of drying grain. \n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 76,500 pounds. of anhydrous ammonia and 14,800 pounds of propane.\n     \n     \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n          a.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2 miles.  \n\n          b.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.  \n     \n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provi"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n\n    There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia and  propane for implementation at this time.\n"
