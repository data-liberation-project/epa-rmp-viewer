      "SummaryText": "Facility Overview: The Red Star Yeast & Products (Red Star) facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Universal Foods Corporation, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Red Star manufactures yeast for sale to the baking and brewing industries and retail consumers.\n\nThe facility is regulated under EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) and is required to submit this RMP due to onsite storage and use of aqua ammonia.  The approximately 30% aqua ammonia solution is used as a nutrient in the yeast manufacturing process.  Aqua ammonia is delivered to the plant by tanker truck and pumped into one of six (one tank is no longer used) storage tanks.  Capacities of the tanks range from 3,580 to 11,000-gallons. \n\nChemical Safety Overview:  The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, operating procedures and maintenance systems in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for anhydrous and aqua ammonia as part of the RMP requirements. If an emergency were to occur in any of the covered processes, an emergency response program has been developed and would be implemented.  This program includes coordination with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), which includes the local fire department. \n\nRelease Scenarios:  The worst-case release scenario following EPA guidelines was represented by a release of aqua ammonia from the storage tanks system.  This scenario included a passive mitigation system. The alternative release scenario was represented by a spill of ammonia during tanker truck off-loading.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:  The facility has had one minor aqua ammonia release in the past five years.  The minor release during maintenance activity of the ammonia feed line to the fermentors occurred in 1997.  The release did not affect any offsite propertie"

      "SummaryText": "s or people.\n\nPrevention Program:  The facility has implemented a Program 2 Prevention Program for aqua ammonia in accordance with US EPA and industry standards.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from the aqua ammonia process at the facility. The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, process hazard reviews, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP revisions and updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.  \n\nEmergency Response Program: The facility has coordinated response with the Milwaukee Fire Department and the LEPC to ensure that any accidental release from the ammonia process will be appropriately addressed.\n\nSafety Management and Changes:  The facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance.  This manager will ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, conduct ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required."
