Safe operation depends on proper storage of chlorine, proper handling of the chlorination system, and inherent safety features in the design of the chlorination system. Safety in storage and handling is achieved through the use of safe handling procedures and training of personnel.   The Suez accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the SRWTF. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Agawam Fire Department.\n\n\n\n(b) The SRWTF is a stationary source operating for the purpose of treating wastewater from households, businesses, and industries within the Springfield and surrounding member communities.  Chlorine, which is a regulated, toxic substance is used as part of the treatment process.\n\n\n\n(c) Suez (formerly United Water) has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at the SRWTF located in Agawam, Massachusetts. An RMP/PSM Compliance Manual was initially developed for the site in 2001, and is continually reviewed and updated as needed or required by regulation.\n\n\n\nKey items included in the RMP/PSM Compliance manual are:\n\n? Written site-specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews and Self-Audits;\n\n\n\n? Chlorine and process safety information as required by the regulations;\n\n\n\n? Standard Operating Procedures for chl"

Training on PSM/RMP and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\n\n\n\n? Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine process at least every 5 years;\n\n\n\n? Conducting a Compliance Audit at least every 3 years;\n\n\n\n? Developing an Emergency Response Plan; and\n\n\n\n? Training in support of the certification of operators.\n\n\n\nThe Suez Project Manager and select employees meet several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/RMP regulations.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management and Risk Management, the organization has an active safety program. The SRWTF has an active Employee Safety Committee that is a joint management-employee committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\n\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are safety tailgate meetings, attended by all employees, to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n\n\n? Hazard Communication\n\n\n\n? Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\n? Lockout/Tagout\n\n\n\n? Confined Space\n\n\n\nThe plant has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program. As a result of these programs, the SRWTF should continue to enjoy an excellent safety record.\n\n\n\n(d) There have been no accidental releases meeting the definition contained in 40 CFR ?68.42(a) within the last five years of operation, or in the history of the plant.\n\n\n\n(e) The emergency response program:\n\nThe SRWTF has developed an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA's 29 CFR ?1910.38. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics (including chlorine), severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by f"

Should an emergency release of chlorine occur at the facility, the facility will be evacuated, the Agawam Fire Department will be notified and the Fire Department will assume Incident Command.\n\n\n\n(f) Planned Changes:\n\nThe SRWTF updated its Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in the first quarter of 2017, completed an informal program review in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was inspected by EPA in November of 2016.  As a result of these program and process reviews, a number of improvements to the Risk Management program have either been completed or planned.  The improvements are intended to improve the safety of the process and minimize the potential for a release.  Changes primarily include program changes (documentation), operating procedure or checklist updates, and employee training.\n\n\n\nRegistration:\n\nThis Risk Management Plan includes the required registration information referenced in 40 CFR ?68.160(b)(1) through (13) to be reported for a Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nAs a Program 3 process with a regulated toxic substance, an offsite consequence analysis has been performed for one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario.
