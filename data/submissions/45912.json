      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\nThe Mankato Energy Center (The Plant) maintains one substance, anhydrous Ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the RMP rule threshold quantities. The listed RMP rule threshold quantity for anhydrous Ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  The Plant will store the anhydrous Ammonia in a 14,700 gallon tank with an administrative policy and safeguards to not fill the tank beyond 85% capacity (i.e. 65,450 pounds).\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia will be used at the Plant as an air pollution control system additive, to minimize the formation of nitrogen oxides in combustion turbine flue gas emissions.  The Plant is a combined cycle plant, consisting of one combustion turbine with a heat recovery system and a steam turbine generator.  The combustion turbine is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device. The anhydrous Ammonia tank, piping and associated equipment are addressed in this Risk Management Plan.  \n\nThe Plant is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (codified in 29 CFR 1910.119) because it stores greater than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous Ammonia.  As such, the facility is required to prepare a PSM plan.  The requirements of a PSM plan and RMP prevention program are essentially equivalent, and this RMP will also serve as the facility PSM plan.\n\nPlant Location\nThe Plant is located at 1 Fazio Lane in Mankato Minnesota.  The Mankato Energy Center is in Blue Earth County, just north of the current Mankato city limits in Lime Township, in the southwest ? of Section 31, Township 109N, Range 26W.  The site is located east of U.S. Highway 169, north of U.S. Highway 14, and west of County Road 5 (3rd Avenue).  The property immediately surrounding the power plant is used for industrial and business purposes.  \n\nAmmonia System Description\nAn Ammonia unloading and storage system is composed of five (5) major components: a tanker truck unloading station, Ammonia storage tank, Ammonia vaporizer, Ammonia Flow Control Unit (AFCU) sk"

Fail-safe breakaway connections for the Ammonia tank liquid fill and vapor equalization lines allow unloading of anhydrous Ammonia from the tanker truck.  \n\nOne 14,700-gallon horizontal tank is provided for anhydrous Ammonia storage.  The storage tank contains a mixture of liquid and vaporized Ammonia under pressure.  Ammonia saturation pressure in the tank varies as a function of ambient air temperature, with 1x100% electric Ammonia vaporizer unit ensuring that a minimum pressure of 85 psig is maintained at all times.  During periods of low ambient temperature, the pressure in the tank will drop to a minimum level at with point a vaporizer is used to maintain the temperature and thus the pressure in the tank.  The Ammonia storage tank and vaporizer are located within a concrete containment pit. An Ammonia supply line from the tank delivers the Ammonia vapor through a pressure regulator to the Ammonia supply header and then to the AFCU skid of the unit.  \n\nThe AFCU skid consists of dual air blowers and inlet air filters, Ammonia/air-mixing chamber, air operated isolation valve, Ammonia flow regulating valve, flow element, and flow transmitter.  The flow of Ammonia into the HRSG is regulated by the Nitrogen Oxide(NOx) content in the combustion turbine exhaust gas stream, measured at points upstream and down stream of SCR Catalyst located within the HRSG. The Ammonia concentration at the outlet of the AFCU is below the TQ limit.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment - PHA\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the Ammonia system using a What/If Analysis type safety review.  The Ammonia tank and associated systems were reviewed for compliance with the American National Standards Institute standards for Ammonia (ANSI K-61.1 ? American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia) and the American "

Compliance with code requirements regarding the storage tanks, unloading station, piping system, vaporizers, air dilution equipment and Ammonia injection grid as well as operational practices and protocols associated with anhydrous Ammonia management were assessed.  A copy of PHA report is provided in the Process Hazard Analysis Section.  \n\nDuring the PHA the entire system was methodically assessed/evaluated.  Points in the system where Ammonia could potentially be released were identified.  Potential failure points, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each element in the system. Valves that are relied on to respond to an Ammonia release were identified as shown on the system engineering diagrams. Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section.  The Hazard Assessment will be reviewed in detail when the systems installations are complete and will be revalidated at a minimum of once every five (5) years.\n\nPrevention System\nThe Plant has operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous Ammonia system.  The Plant maintains an Operation and Maintenance manual prepared by the Ammonia system manufacturer.  Plant personnel will receive training before being allowed to work on the system.\n\nThe Ammonia systems are visually inspected once per shift on a 24-hour per day basis.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the Ammonia system have been incorporated into the plant?s operation.  The SOPs are written and posted in appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  Personnel will receive training prior to being allowed to work on the Ammonia system. The facility will coordinate an Ammonia emergency response training exercise with the Mankato Fire "

      "SummaryText": "Department and local hazardous material response team.  \n\nControl and monitoring of the equipment and instrumentation associated with the Ammonia storage tanks, unloading area, and vaporizer skid is done by the local Ammonia system PLC.  To protect system equipment and to minimize disruptions to plant operation, protective actions are automatically taken if certain system components malfunction.  The Operator cannot intervene to cancel these actions because of the system design.  Protective actions include Overload and shortcut protection for the vaporizer heater, over temperature cutout for the vaporizer heater, and fail close isolation valves associated with the Ammonia storage tank.  \n\nThe Ammonia tank and vaporizer are located within a concrete pit to contain potential spills and leaks.  An Ammonia leak in the vicinity of the storage and unloading area will be detected by the Ammonia sensors.  If the Ammonia concentration exceeds 70 ppm a high level alarm is sent from the local PLC to the Plant DCS.  If the Ammonia concentration exceeds 100 ppm, a high high-level alarm is sent from the local PLC to the Plant DCS.  In either case, the operator must evaluate the situation, close the isolation valves, and operate the water deluge system as required.\n\nIn the event that the storage tank or interconnecting piping design pressure is exceeded due to vaporizer malfunction, fire, or other means, safety relief valves will lift and discharge Ammonia vapor to atmosphere.  Depending upon the magnitude of the Ammonia discharge, the leak detection system may be initiated.  Prior to the lifting of the safety relief valves, the high-pressure switch located on the Ammonia storage tank shall initiate an alarm from the local PLC to the Plant DCS, that the system design pressure is being approached.\n\nThe fail safe breakaway connections furnished for truck unloading, tank pump-out and vent balancing are designed to prevent Ammonia leakage from the tank in the event that the connection"

The unloading station consists of a liquid fill line and vapor return line between the storage tank and tanker truck to properly equalize pressure during unloading.  Both lines are equipped with quick disconnect fittings and check valves that allow a safe disconnect in the event the truck pulls away from the unloading station prematurely.  Both lines are equipped with emergency shutoff valves that will allow the operator to manually stop the flow of Ammonia.  Each emergency shutoff valve has a remote cable so that they can be operated at a safe distance from the truck.  The station is equipped with a level indicator that displays the level of fluid in the storage tank to prevent overfilling.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe Plant?s Emergency Response Plan was modified to address Ammonia incident response.  Plant personnel will be trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by shutting off key emergency valves.  The Mankato Fire Department will perform any response requiring entry into a dangerous atmosphere or situation.  A copy of this RMP will be sent to the county Local Emergency Planning Coordinator (LEPC).  A copy of the Plant?s modified Emergency Action Plan is included.\n\nAccident History\nThe Plant has not had any Ammonia releases in its history, as the Ammonia storage tank is new to the facility."
