CalARP requires that RMPs be updated at least every five years.  On behalf of the AB Los Angeles Brewery, ERM-West, Inc. (ERM) has prepared this RMP update to satisfy that requirement.  The RMP is submitted to the Los Angeles Fire Department, who function as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for the City of Los Angeles.  This RMP covers the anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant at the brewery in quantities exceeding the Federal and California quantity thresholds of 10,000 pounds:\n\n?

The facility utilizes trained staff, modern equipment to monitor the facility, and numerous safeguards to effectively and safely use ammonia for refrigeration purposes.\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe AB Los Angeles Brewery has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.

The program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental releases from the facility.  The facility Prevention Program is a living program that is updated as required to reflect facility changes.\n\nPer the CalARP management system requirements (CCR ? 2735.6) the Prevention Program includes:\n\n?    A management system to oversee the implementation of the CalARP Program elements.\n\n?    A qualified person has been designated with overall responsibility for the development and integration of the CalARP Program elements.\n\nFor the AB Los Angeles Brewery, Mr. Christopher Harden (EHS&S Manager) is the CalARP Coordinator, and has overall responsibility for the development and integration of the program.  Other EHS&S Managers assist Mr. Harden in program updates and implementation.\n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe AB Los Angeles Brewery located at 15800 Roscoe Boulevard, Van Nuys, California.  The brewery originally opened at this location in 1954.  The facility occupies approximately 95 acres and operates an approximately 1,700,00 square foot (total floor space) brewery.  The brewery utilizes approximately 160,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to keep the products at their desired temperatures.  The ammonia refrigerations system includes, but is not limited to ammonia receivers, transfer pumps, compressors, condensers, heat exchangers, air conditioning units, and piping.  \n\nNo other substances at the AB Los Angeles Brewery exceeds their respective Federal or California threshold quantities.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe CalARP program has different requirements based on the complexity, accident history, and potential impact of releases of the regulated substance"

These requirements are divided into three levels:  Program 1, Program 2, and Program 3, with Program 3 being the strictest.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia process results in distance to toxic endpoints that extends past the property boundary.  Additionally, the process is subject to the federal OSHA process safety management standards of Section 1910.119 of Title 29 of CFR or Section 5189 of Title 8 of CCR.  Thus, Program Level 3 requirements apply to the anhydrous ammonia process.\n\nThe CalARP Program requires Program Level 3 facilities to develop an RMP that includes the following key elements:\n\n?    2745.3 RMP Executive Summary Component \n\n?    2745.4 RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Component \n\n?    2745.5 RMP Five-year Accident History Component \n\n?    2745.7 RMP Program 3 Prevention Program Component\n\no    2760.1 Process Safety Information\n\no    2760.2 Process Hazard Analysis [PHA]\n\no    2760.3 Operating Procedures \n\no    2760.4 Training \n\no    2760.5 Mechanical Integrity\n\no    2760.6 Management of Change \n\no    2760.7 Pre-Startup Review\n\no    2760.8 Compliance Audits \n\no    2760.9 Incident Investigation\n\no    2760.10 Employee Participation\n\no    2760.11 Hot Work Permit \n\no    2760.12 Contractors \n\n?    2745.8 RMP Emergency Response Program Component\n\n?    2745.9 RMP Certification\n\nThe AB Los Angeles Brewery has recognized the inherent potential risks associated with the storage and use of ammonia and has structured its safety programs to manage these risks.

The AB Los Angeles Brewery's emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (8 CCR 3220) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). The Brewery has trained employees for emergency response and maintains an \"Environmental/Safety Incident Plan\" (ESIP) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the Los Angeles City Fire Department. Annual drills are conducted for implementation of the ESIP at the brewery.  The ESIP includes emergencies such as fires, significant chemical leaks, or spills.\n\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed.
