The RMP is submitted to the Los Angeles Fire Department, who function as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for the City of Los Angeles.

The AB Los Angeles Brewery's emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (8 CCR 3220) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). The Brewery has trained employees for emergency response and maintains an Environmental/Safety Incident Plan (ESIP) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the Los Angeles City Fire Department. Annual drills are conducted for implementation of the ESIP at the brewery.  The ESIP includes emergencies such as fires, significant chemical leaks, or spills.\r\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed. Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\r\nAdditionally, the AB Los Angeles Brewery has an an emergency response team (ABET) trained to respond to ammonia releases.
