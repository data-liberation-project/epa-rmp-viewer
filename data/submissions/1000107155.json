Our products are used in every day consumer applications such as printing inks, dyes, adhesives, mastics, pressure sensitive adhesive applications, rubber products and tires. As part of our production process, Neville Chemical Company uses a variety of petroleum based resin forming feedstocks that are blended and charged to production units. Petroleum based hydrocarbon resin production requires the use of various regulated chemicals. Of these regulated chemicals, only boron trifluoride gas (BF3), which is used as a catalyst, is subject to Risk Management Plan provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nNeville Chemical Company is committed to safe plant operations. The prevention of fires, explosions, and chemical releases is a priority.  Design, construction, and maintenance of processes and equipment are in accordance with established codes, standards, and practices.  All aspects of operations are reviewed periodically in order to minimize risk, and insure safe operation.   Incidents and near misses are reviewed, and corrective action taken when necessary.  All personnel involved in operating and maintaining processes and equipment are trained to carry out their assignments safely and effectively. \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention\r\n\r\nNeville Chemical Company has several Plans and Programs in place for prevention, control and mitigation of accidental releases.  Neville has combined the following plans into a single emergency\r\nresponse document called the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) in accordance with EPA guidance.  The included plans are Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency Plan (PPC), Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC), Allegheny County Hazardous Materials Off-Site Response Plan, Ma"

Neville Chemical Company also complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations and the Coast Guard's security regulation in 33 CFR 105.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNeville Chemical Company has not had a reportable accident or a reportable quantity release of boron trifluoride in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nNeville Chemical Company's emergency response program is designed to promote coordination between facility personnel, emergency response personnel (i.e., fire departments, HAZMAT, police, etc.) and outside contractors.  Neville Chemical Company conducts drills and exercises at the facility, with outside personnel and agencies to improve coordination and ensure familiarity with our facility.   These drills and exercises also allow Neville Chemical Company to evaluate the capabilities of our outside resources.  In addition to drills and exercises, Neville Chemical Company also performs tabletop exercises, that on-occasion will involve our outside support resources.  \r\n\r\nIn conjunction with our boron trifluoride supplier, Neville Chemical Company periodcally reviews operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and our safety and health practices to identify where improvements can be made.  The supplier may also periodically audit the BF3 system and provide employee training.\r\n\r\nNeville Chemical Company trains personnel to make sure they are familiar with their duties and responsibilities in accordance with established policies and procedures.  Neville Chemical Company has multiple systems to provide internal notifications and ensure communication among employees.  Systems include alarms, a public address system, and two-way radios.

Removal of these devices reduces the possibility of leaks due to mechanical failure. \r\n \r\nImprovements to the BF3 manifold have been implemented. The overall number of valves in the system has been reduced by over 50%, diaphragm and bellows sealed valves have been installed as replacements where possible.  The amount of high pressure manifold piping has been significantly reduced, and the number or trailer hookup locations has been reduced from 3 to 1.  In addition, a second Remote Operated Valve (ROV) has been installed and tied in to the remotely located shutdown / deluge activation stations to isolate the process piping from the tube trailer connection piping.  Evaluation will continue, to determine if a suitable option can be found to replace ball valves used in isolation service.\r\n\r\nNeville Chemical Company will continue to identify equipment and techniques for improving process safety.  The Company believes that our existing programs, policies, and operating procedures are designed to minimize the impact to employees, and the community in the event of a release."
