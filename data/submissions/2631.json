              "Description": " Prevention Program\n \n 1.0 INTRODUCTION\n \n At Georgia Pacific-Leaf River Pulp  Operations, the facility takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The management systems address each of the key features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n \n 7    Process safety information (PSI)\n 7    Process hazard analysis (PHA)\n 7    Operating procedures (OP)\n 7    Training (Trg)\n 7    Mechanical integrity (MI)\n 7    Management of change (MOC)\n 7    Pre-startup review (PSSR)\n 7    Compliance audits (CA)\n 7    Incident investigation (II)\n 7    Employee participation (EP)\n 7    Hot work permit (HW)\n 7    Contractors (Contr)\n \n These individual elements of the accident prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  The company and employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way the facility does business, and have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that the facility is meeting their own high standards for accident prevention.\n \n 2.0 PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n \n In accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, the facility systematically controls the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with the process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment. This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of the risk management program. The facility also uses this information directly to ensure that the equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n \n 2.1 Process Safety Information Details\n \n The facility maintains the following chemical process information for each regulated substance in a covered process as well as for other hazardous materials in both covered and non-covered processes:\n \n7 Toxicity information\n7 Permissible exposure limits\n7 Physical data\n7 Reactivity data\n7 Corrosivity data\n7 Thermal and chemical stability data\n7 Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur\n \n The facility uses material safety data sheets (MSDSs) to provide most of the process chemical information.  Whenever required information, such as corrosivity data or hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing, is not available in MSDSs, the facility develops the missing data from other sources and provides it in separate documents.\n \n The facility maintains the following required process technology information:\n \n7 Block flow or simplified process flow diagram\n7 Process chemistry\n7 Maximum intended inventory\n7 Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, flow, or composition\n7 Evaluation of the consequences of deviations from established operating limits\n \n Most of this information comes from the engineering design documents for the processes, but in some cases, the facility has developed such information through special projects. Additionally, operating limits, maximum intended inventories, and consequences of deviations not available from engineering design documentation were developed from manufacturer's operating manuals.\n \n The facility also maintains the following information pertaining to equipment in the regulated processes (as well as for many of the non regulated processes):\n \n7 Materials of construction\n7 Piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs)\n7 Electrical classification\n7 Relief system design and design basis\n7 Ventilation system design\n7 Design codes and standards employed\n7 Material and energy balances for processes built after 5/26/92\n7 Safety systems (interlocks, detection, or suppression systems)\n \n Again, most of this information comes from the engineering design documents for the processes as well as from the facility's own maintenance files. Whenever required information was not available, the facility obtained the information from equipment vendors and plant engineering. In conjunction with the equipment information collection efforts, the facility documented that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n \n \n \n 3.0 PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.67 of the RMP Rule, the facility uses process hazard analyses (PHAs) to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards. The most important products of the PHA are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases. The facility ensures that all recommendations from the PHAs are resolved appropriately, and the facility ensures that information from the PHAs (including recommended resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\n \n 3.l    Process Hazard Analysis Details\n \n The facility conducts systematic PHAs of the regulated processes and other hazardous processes at the facility according to an established schedule. This schedule ensures that the facility (1) address each process in a prioritized order (based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees and/or off site population, the age of the process, and the operating history of the process) and (2) update/revalidate each PHA at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). The facility also conducts PHAs of all new processes before those processes are placed in service.\n \n The facility primarily uses the \"Checklist\" and \"HAZOP\" techniques to perform PHAs, although the facility can use other EPA/OSHA-approved techniques when they are more appropriate for specific applications.\n \n The facility PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience, including at least one person who has knowledge and experience in the process to be evaluated and a PHA team leader trained in the application of the hazard evaluation technique used for the PHA.\n \n The facility has a system in place to promptly resolve PHA team findings and recommendations, and communicate findings/recommendation resolutions to potentially affected personnel.\n \n PHAs are implemented in a written report for each analysis soon after the analysis meetings are completed. The managers review and resolve the PHA recommendations after receiving the report. The facility maintains a written action plan tracking the resolution status of each recommendation, including an assigned individual responsible for resolving each recommendation and a target completion date. The facility documents the final resolution of each recommendation, and advise the PHA team of any recommendations that are rejected.\n \n 4.0 OPERATING PROCEDURES\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.69 of the RMP Rule, the facility uses operating procedures to define how process-related job tasks assigned to personnel should be performed to avoid incidents. The facility uses these procedures to (1) train employees before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, and (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.\n \n 4.1    Operating Procedure Details\n \n The facility's operators, and  supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures for all phases of operations including:\n \n7 Initial start up\n7 Normal operations\n7 Temporary operations\n7 Emergency shutdown, including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required and assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner\n7 Emergency operations\n7 Normal shutdown\n7 Start up following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown\n \n The facility development teams use PSI, information from process designers/equipment manufacturers, and their own experience to create and validate the procedures.\n \n The procedures address the following information:\n \n7 Steps for safely conducting activities\n7 Safe operating limits\n7 Consequences of process deviations, as well as steps required to correct or avoid such deviations\n7 Safety and health considerations including (1) properties of; and hazards presented by, the chemicals used in the process, (2) precautions necessary to prevent exposure, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment, (3) control measures to be taken if physical contact or airborne exposure occurs, (4) quality control for raw materials and control of regulated substance inventory levels, and (5) any special or unique hazards\n7 Safety systems and their functions\n \n In addition to the process-specific procedures, the facility also develops and maintains more widely applicable safe work practices addressing issues such as lockout/tag out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entry to processes. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractors.\n \n The facility has a formal review process to approve procedures and changes to procedures. Furthermore, the facility annually reviews existing procedures, makes any needed revisions, and certifies the procedures as current and accurate. The facility keeps procedures in locations that are readily accessible to employees who may need the procedures.\n \n \n \n 5.0 TRAINING\n \n In accordance with 40 CRF 68.71 of the RMP Rule, the facility trains employees to safely perform their assigned tasks. The training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process/equipment changes are made. As part of the training, the facility includes provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training (written tests, field demonstrations, etc.).\n \n \n 5.1 Training Details\n \n The facility provides the operators with initial and refresher training, which includes a general overview of the process, properties of chemicals in the process, and safety and health hazards, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. The facility provides initial training to new operators before they are allowed to work independently as operators.\n \n Periodically, at least every three years, the facility provides the operators with refresher training that, depending on job classification, can include operating procedures training, equipment-specific training, and/or advanced (beyond HAZCOM) chemical-specific training. The refresher training courses emphasize process overview information, safe work practices, operating procedures that are rarely used such as emergency shutdown, emergency operation and start up following an emergency shutdown, and any operating issues requested by the shift group. The operators are consulted annually with a written questionnaire on the frequency of refresher training, and their input is documented and considered when preparing training schedules.\n \n All training is certified by some form of evaluation to verify that the training has been understood. The facility uses a combination of physical demonstration of skills, oral reviews using a one-on-one format, and written tests. The facility reviews the information missed by an employee who does not pass all testing requirements, and does not allow resumption of work until minimum testing requirements are met.\n \n All training is documented and includes the employee's name, date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n \n \n 6.0 MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.73 of the RMP Rule, the facility maintains the mechanical integrity (MI) of the process equipment using an inspection and testing program and a quality assurance program, and ensures that the equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly. The facility trains maintenance personnel in the hazards of the process, and also provides additional training on procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of the process equipment so that job tasks are performed safely.\n \n 6.1 Mechanical Integrity Details\n \n The facility considers all process-related equipment and safety systems that are critical for preventing and/or mitigating releases of regulated substances to be covered by the MI program. Examples include:\n \n7 Pressure vessels and storage tanks\n7 Piping systems, including valves\n7 Relief and vent systems and devices\n7 Emergency shutdown systems\n7 Controls such as monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks pumps\n \n The MI program uses preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that is deteriorating and needs repair or replacement before failure occurs. This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return deteriorated equipment to acceptable specifications. The facility maintains written procedures that support the MI program as follows:\n \n7 Standard maintenance procedures describe the methods that mechanics use to perform repairs, replacements, and installations.\n \n7 Procedures for safe work practices and safety policies specify safe practices for performing maintenance tasks such as lockout/tag out, hot work, confined space entry, line or equipment opening, and control over entry for a covered process by plant and/or contract maintenance personnel.\n \n7 The inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance procedures describe the methods used by maintenance personal to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks on process equipment. These procedures follow generally accepted good engineering practices. The equipment inspection and testing frequency is based on mean time to failure estimates provided by the manufacturer, adjusted by the facility's own experience.\n \n The facility documents all inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance activities including:\n \n7 Date of inspection, test, or preventive maintenance\n7 Person performing the activity\n7 Equipment identifier\n7 Description of the activity performed\n7 Results of the activity (including any deficiencies noted)\n \n The facility identifies equipment deficiencies through the inspection, testing, and preventive maintenance activities or from routine operating and maintenance tasks and correct them promptly. If the facility cannot immediately correct identified equipment deficiencies, the facility implements protective measures to ensure safe operation until repairs can be made.\n \n The facility has a quality assurance program that addresses new facilities, equipment, maintenance materials, and spare parts. The program seeks to verify proper fabrication of new equipment, proper installation of new or repaired/replaced equipment, and use of suitable maintenance materials and spare parts in the preventive maintenance and repair tasks.\n \n The facility has a comprehensive training program covering all MI issues. The program uses the procedures described previously. For example, all mechanics, maintenance supervisors, and maintenance engineers are trained on hazards for all RMP-covered processes and on safe work practices. The maintenance personnel also receive training on safe maintenance procedures, preventive maintenance practices, and special skills requiring craft certification. All training, as described above, occurs before employees perform tasks in RMP-covered areas independently.\n \n 7.0 MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.75 of the RMP Rule, the facility evaluates and approves all proposed changes (i.e., modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through the management of change (MOC) program. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The facility uses this close scrutiny of all changes to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, or the environment.\n \n 7.1 Management of Change Details\n \n The facility analyzes each proposed change and confirms that:\n \n7 The technical basis for the change is appropriate\n7 The safety and health impacts of the change are understood and appropriate controls are in place\n7 The procedures are modified as appropriate for the change\n7 The permissible time period is established for temporary changes The change is authorized by appropriate personnel\n \n Our MOC procedure contains a step-by-step description of the confirmation process. It defines and provides examples of changes and replacements in kind.  Also, it describes in detail the requirement for each confirmation step based on the type of change being considered.  The facility uses a Management of Change form to document each step in the confirmation process. Changes that pass the confirmation criteria are communicated to the employees who are affected by the change before the change is implemented. When approved changes require updates to the process safety information and/or operating procedures, the facility revises these documents and trains employees on these changes before operations resume. All training is documented as formal operator training.\n \n \n 8.0 PRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.77 of the RMP rule, the facility performs pre-startup safety reviews as a final check to ensure the safety of a new or modified process before it is placed in service.\n \n \n 8.1 Pre-Startup Review Details\n \n The facility performs pre-startup reviews on new stationary sources and on modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The pre-startup review is completed before regulated substances are brought into the process and only after the facility has confirmed that:\n \n7 Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n7 Safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate\n7 PHAs have been performed on new stationary sources and all recommendations have been resolved\n7 MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes\n7 Training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees\n \n The facility uses a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist as an aid in documenting the performance of the pre-startup reviews. The checklist contains a list of safety questions covering process considerations that must be addressed prior to start up. The person responsible for the project prepares the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form and provides the names of the reviewer responsible for confirmation of each of the pre-startup review safety questions. Each reviewer signs off on the Checklist and Approval Form when satisfied that all assigned safety questions are complete and no problems exist. All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form before start up can be authorized.\n \n 9.0 COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.79 of the RMP Rule, the facility audits the RMP-covered processes to be certain that the prevention programs are effective. The compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n \n \n \n \n 9.1    Compliance Audit Details\n \n The facility conducts and certifies compliance audits of the prevention program for RMP-covered processes at least every three years. The facility integrates these audits into PSM audits. The audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited. The audit team collectively possesses the following skills and knowledge:\n \n7 Ability to understand the prevention program requirements of the RMP regulation (49 CFR Part 68)\n7 Capability to conduct interviews and collect audit data\n7 Capability to document audit results\n7 Knowledge of the process to be audited\n \n The audit team members receive training in RMP regulatory requirements, interview techniques, and methods for data collection before participating in an audit. They use a protocol or a check sheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement of the RMP regulation. The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover in the audit. Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and deficiencies or noncompliances are identified. At the conclusion of the audit, the audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.\n \n The facility promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date. The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored quarterly until open issues are resolved. The facility retains the two most recent audit reports.\n \n 10.0 INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.81 of the RMP Rule, the facility performs incident investigations to help ensure that incidents with catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout the organization to help prevent a recurrence.\n \n \n 10.1 Incident Investigation Details\n \n The facility investigates all incidents (including near misses) that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a large uncontrolled release of a regulated substance, serious injuries to employees or the public, and/or damage to the environment. The facility trains employees to identify occurrences requiring investigation and to notify the appropriate person should such an event occur. If the incident meets RMP-classification criteria, the facility initiates an investigation within 48 hours. The facility assembles an investigation team consisting of:\n \n7 At least one person knowledgeable in the process or activity involved\n7 A contract employee if the incident or near miss incident involved the work of a contractor or had acute, adverse health effects on contract employees\n7 Others with appropriate knowledge and skills to thoroughly investigate and analyze the event\n \n The facility trains investigation team leaders in investigation techniques, including root cause analysis. The investigation team follows a written investigation protocol that addresses the key steps of fact finding, determination of cause, and development of recommendations/actions to be taken. From the raw data collected, the incident investigation team prepares the text for an incident summary report, which contains:\n \n7 Date and time of the event\n7 Date and time the investigation started\n7 Description of the event\n7 Identification of contributing factors\n7 Recommendations from the investigation\n \n The facility resolves the report recommendations and develops action plans that are tracked to completion. The facility reviews the incident investigation report and action plan items with employees (and contract employees, as appropriate) who work in the affected area and/or perform job tasks relevant to the investigation findings. The facility accomplishes this review by discussing the event at the next safety meeting or in shift meetings. The facility retains incident reports for at least five years.\n \n 11.0 EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.83 of the RMP Rule, the employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing the RMP.\n \n \n 11.1 Employee Participation Details\n \n The facility has a written employee participation program that meets RMP requirements. In this document, the facility describes in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the RMP regulations. The facility periodically updates this document as changes occur.\n \n The facility consults with employees and their representatives on ways to improve participation in the RMP.\n \n \n \n 12.0 HOT WORK PERMITS\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.85 of the RMP Rule, the facility uses a hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near an RMP-covered process.\n \n \n 12.1    Hot Work Permit Details\n \n The facility studied OSHA's fire prevention and protection regulation in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and developed a procedure that addresses these requirements. The facility also created a Hot Work Permit Form to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed. New employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure as part of the safe work practices orientation. The Safety Department audits completed Hot Work Permit Forms to ensure that any errors in preparation or approval are identified and brought to the attention of those involved to prevent recurrence.\n \n 13.0 CONTRACTORS\n \n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.87 of the RMP Rule, the facility has a contractor screening procedure to help ensure that the facility hires and uses only contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of plant employees, the public, or the environment.\n \n \n 13.1    Contractor Details\n \n The facility has a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, shutdown, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP-covered process. This program does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety.\n \n The facility selects contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the bid process. The bid information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker's compensation insurance experience). Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record, are dropped from further consideration. Contractors that meet the minimum safety requirements are then judged on who can do a quality job at the lowest cost. If a contractor currently working in the plant is under consideration, the facility reviews recent safety audits and contact the facility's people on the job site to verify satisfactory job performance before the facility authorizes the purchase order.\n \n The facility provides a safety orientation for Contractor Supervisors before they begin work on site. The facility requires these Contractor Supervisors to provide this same safety orientation to their employees who will work in the facility. The facility uses the orientation meeting to familiarize contractors with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working. The facility provides copies of the Contractor Safety Manual, which contains plant safety rules/policies, safe work practices, a material hazards summary, and an outline of emergency actions for contractors. The facility provides MSDSs for the hazardous materials that may affect the contractor work area, copies of plant safe work practices and policies, and emergency response actions associated with the contractor's work. The facility then takes the Contractor Supervisors on a tour of the job site to point out the hazards discussed in the meeting, introduce personnel with whom they will communicate, and show where medical attention may be provided.\n \n The facility requires contractors to perform the following tasks to help ensure process safety:\n \n7 Train each of their employees in the work practices necessary to safely perform the contracted work\n7 Provide each of their employees with the same safety orientation that the facility provided for contractors and supervisors\n7 Train each of their employees on the plant's safe work practices\n7 Document that each of their employees has received and understands the training noted above\n7 Ensure that each of their employees follows the plant safety rules and safe work practices\n7 Report to the facility's staff any hazards created or found by their employees at the job site\n7 Provide access and responses to the facility's personnel who may appear at the job site to evaluate contractor safety performance\n7 Provide information on contract employee job site injuries/illnesses to the facility's designated representative",

As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Leaf River. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule (chlorine dioxide ) - see topic 1.3\n \n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) -see topic 1.4\n \n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n4. A managrment system that delineates responsibiitty for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Plan\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one compone"

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and any injuries and damage that could occur.\n\nGP/Leaf River minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nGP/Leaf River limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at GP/Leaf River consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGP/Leaf River is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and "
