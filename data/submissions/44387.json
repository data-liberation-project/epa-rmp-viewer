This particular ARS is assumed to last for 5 minutes before operation of isolation valves, pumps, deluge, shutdowns and/or other mitigating actions can be utilized to mitigate the release.  Under this ARS, the released propane vapor is distance to the lower flammability limit endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 miles.

This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal is located at 530 Manufacturers Road, just east of U.S. Highway No. 27 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal provides storage and terminal operations for propane.  Propane is typically delivered to the facility via railcar and shipped out via trucks.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal is able to store enough of propane to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the Chattanooga Propane Terminal is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest inventory of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of propane) contained in a single pressurized storage vessel.  The maximum quantity possible contained within this storage vessel is 460,000 pounds.  Although administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination.  The entire inventory of the storage tank is assumed to release, form a vapor cloud, ignite and explode-creating a vapor cloud explosion.  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 0.6 miles.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such rel"

Contractors working within the Chattanooga Propane Terminal are provding with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency procedure equipments, and (4) site-specific applicable safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selection of a contractor.  Chattanooga Propane Terminal personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with respect to their safety obligations, and provide contractors with applicable safety performance feedback.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSRs)\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal conducts a PSSR for any new or modified facility that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  When new facilities are commissioned, a PHA is included in the PSSR.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

The approved prevention and/or mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal periodically revalidates these PHAs.  These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities.  The recommendations from these revalidated PHA\u00bfs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  In addition, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including demonstrated skills used to verify that the operator understood the training.  Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.  Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has procedures in place to verify that contractors perform their work in a safe manner.  These contractor safety procedures include steps to verify contractors (1) have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their jobs safety, (2) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules and (5) inform facility personnel of any potential"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process,  (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency responses plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner and serve as basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help verify equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified that presents an immediate safety concern, Chattanooga Propane Terminal personnel will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into services.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedures to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

In Addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its recommendations t o prevent a recurrence, and forwards these recommendations to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams\u00bf recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00bfs findings are tracked unt"
