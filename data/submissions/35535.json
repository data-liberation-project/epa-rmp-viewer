      "SummaryText": "The Clermont County Water and Sewer District, in southwest Ohio, operates two facilities which use one-ton containers of chlorine gas.  Gas from the containers is drawn into a stream of water through an \"injector\".  The resulting stream of chlorinated water is piped into the treatment processes.\n     The Pierce-Union-Batavia Water Treatment Plant (PUBWTP), at 650 State Route 749 in Pierce Township, has a maximum capacity of 8 tons of chlorine, a typical inventory of 5 tons, and uses about 16 tons per year to disinfect the drinking water it produces.\n     The County has shaped its safety policies, standard operating procedures, maintenance, and training to emphasize the prevention of any chlorine leaks.  If, despite this preparation, a leak occurs, the facilities are designed to contain it.  If containment cannot be accomplished, the County Emergency Response Agency is prepared, along with the Pierce Township Fire Department and the Greater Cincinnati Hazmat Team, to stop the leak at its source and to minimize its impact on the public.  PUBWTP has used one-ton cylinders of chlorine since 1990.  There has never been a leak at this facility of a magnitude sufficient to require emergency response, or to affect the public.  No plant operator has undergone exposure sufficient to require medical assistance.\n     Leak scenarios were performed on a computer model by the County Emergency Response Agency.  If an actual leak occurs, the computer model can be used to determine, in a matter of minutes, what area (if any) needs to be evacuated, based on the amount of chlorine released and the current atmospheric conditions.  \n     The worst case scenario was based on the complete release of the maximum inventory of chlorine within 10 minutes.  This could only occur if all the ton containers were full and were simultaneously ruptured, which would require extraordinary circumstances and considerable outside force.  At PUBWTP,  under average weather conditions, with minimal wind"

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 35535,
      "SummaryText": "out of the southwest,  the worst case scenario shows the chlorine moving towards the western part of Amelia and thence towards Batavia.  The computer model does not plot the plume beyond a six-mile extent; therefore this distance was reported in the RMP.  It is expected that at least some of the chlorine, which is heavier than air, would travel up the Ten Mile Creek valley.  The area nearest the PUBWTP is low density residential.  Locust Corner Elementary School and Amelia High School both lie in the projected path, along with businesses along State Route 125, from approximately White Oak to McMann Roads.  \n     The alternative scenario was based on a more realistic possibility:  a single one-ton container leaking through a broken pipe or valve, with the leak stopped in one hour.  Using average weather conditions and a breeze from the southwest, the computer model projects a chlorine plume that would affect homes within 1300 yards, probably less than 20 in number. \n     Treatment plant operators are careful in their duties and respectful of the potential danger of chlorine.  They are trained to prevent leaks, and know how to respond if one should occur.  Access to the facility is controlled.  The Clermont County Water and Sewer District has been, and remains, trustworthy in the handling of chlorine."
