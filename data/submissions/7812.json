Further information on each chemical may be obtained by reviewing the MSDS's located on the bookshelf on the left-hand side of the Operator's console.

Facility and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe City of Anacortes Water Treatment Plant is located on the east bank of the Skagit River in Mount Vernon.\n\nDescription of Process.\n\nThe source of untreated water for the City of Anacortes water supply system is the Skagit River.  The treatment process consists of raw water intake and pumping, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, disinfection and finish water pumping.  The intake structure is located on the west bank of the river.  The water is pumped across the river to the flocculation and sedimentation basins at the treatment plant site.  Following flocculation and sedimentation, the water flows through the filter beds"

Eight vertical and two smaller variable speed turbine centrifugal pumps deliver the chlorinated water to the transmission pipelines.\n\nAlum, lime, polymer, chlorine and activated carbon can be mixed with the raw water as part of the treatment process to aid in the removal of solid particles and other contaminants.  Mechanical flocculators were installed upstream of the sedimentation basins when the filter plant was built in 1978 to improve plant performance.  Solids settled out in the sedimentation basin are mechanically removed from the bottom by continuous chain scrapers.\n\nThe six filters contain a mixed media filter material.  These filters remove the remaining particles in the water before it enters the clearwell.  They are equipped with surface agitators and are backwashed when the head loss through them exceeds the maximum value for optimum operation.  The filters are also backwashed if the turbidity of the effluent water exceeds 0.2 NTUs regardless of the head loss.  Backwash water for the filters is pumped from the clearwell.\n\nTreated water (i.e., Finished Water) is supplied to the transmission pipeline by eight high-head pumps and two variable-speed pumps at the treatment plant.  The actual output of the high-head pumps is limited by the capacity of the transmission pipeline to approximately 33-mgd.  Actual peak flow rates in 1997 were 30.0 mgd.\n\nSediment from the flocculation chamber, sedimentation basins, and the filter backwash process is piped to the plant waste sump.  Two pumps are used to pump this wastewater to a solids handling facility.  The solids handling facility consists of three lagoons located on plant property.  The lagoons allow for suspended material to settle out.  Clear water can then be allowed to flow back to the river or to dissipate through natural percolation and evaporation. \n\n3.

Rotate container if needed, close building vents, then proceed with the installation of the B-kit to contain the leak.\n7 If 10 pounds or more of chlorine is released, the plant manager or authorized supervisor and CERT team must be called immediately for assistance, then call 911.\n7 Provide first aid/CPR for Chlorine exposure.\n7 Fill out an incident report for Washington Cities Insurance Authority.\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History.\nThe Anacortes Water Treatment Plant has had no reportable incidents in the last five years. A reportable incident is classified as an incidental spill of ten lbs or more.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nOur chlorine emergency response plan is designed to educate and prepare the Chlorine Emergency Response Team (CERT) for the effective and rapid response in the execution and elimination of a real or potential chlorine hazard by training it's members through preplanning and coordination in a professional and unified manner. This policy is reviewed yearly for any needed updates.\n\nThe Chlorine Emergency Response Team (CERT) is made up of members of the Water Treatment Plant. The team is on call 24 hours a day. The objective of the team is to respond quickly to contain any leaks or ruptures of chlorine containers found at the Treatment Plant or on any lands owned or operated by the City of Anacortes. All team members train four times each year in the use of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and on how to set up and use the Ton Repair Kit\n\nIn the event of a serious leak that releases or has the potential to release 10 or more pounds of chlorine local responders (Mount Vernon Fire Dept.) and the County Department of Emergency Services will be called to assist.\n\nAlso, as part of our overall safety program, we conduct the following"

Annual Site Survey: Once a year an inspection team made up of members of the Safety Committee will conduct \na thorough walk through inspection of each work site. They will list any safety hazards or potential hazards at the walk through. Results of these inspections will be used to control obvious hazards, target certain work areas for more intensive investigation, assist in revising checklists used during regular monthly safety inspections, and as part of annual review of the effectiveness of our accident prevention program.\nB. Periodic Change Survey: Any time a new piece of equipment is received, a change is made in work procedures, or any changes made to building structures that may have safety ramifications, safety committee representatives shall examine the changed conditions and make recommendations to eliminate or control hazards that may be created as a result of the change.\n\nC.\tMonthly Safety Inspection: Each month before regularly scheduled safety committee meeting, each \nmember will inspect their area for hazards using the standard safety inspection checklist and talk to co-workers regarding their safety concerns. The committee member will report any hazards or concerns expressed to the whole committee for consideration. Results of area inspections and any actions taken shall be posted in affected areas. Committee members may, periodically, agree to inspect each other's areas to provide different outlook. \n\nJob Hazard Analysis: When work areas or tasks are identified as potentially hazardous as the result of a review of injury records, a note on the annual site survey, or a reasonable concern expressed by a worker, supervisor, or safety committee member, a hazard analysis is to be conducted by a group from the safety committee using the Job Hazard Analysis form and instructions will be scheduled as soon as possible. The job will be modified as needed to control or eliminate the hazard. Employees will be trained in revised operation. Re"

      "SummaryText": "sults will be reported to safety committee.\n \n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nWe are currently in the planning stage of an active mitigation system. The system we have under consideration is called the ChlorTainer- Total Containment System.  The system incorporates the use of secondary containers that enclose our current ton containers, and still allow us to draw chlorine directly to our existing chlorinators. The system vents no toxic gas during normal emergency operations, prevents hazardous waste generation and disposal.  It also requires no emergency power generation and will automatically shutdown during a seismic event or other natural disaster and still contain any release. Any container release would be processed at the normal rate through our on-site chlorinators."
