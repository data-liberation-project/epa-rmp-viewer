      "SummaryText": "C&S Wholesale Grocers Inc took over the Cranston facility from Supervalu in October of 2003.\nC&S Wholsale Grocers Inc has begun its facility risk management program by defining the process. The process at the perishable facility is one of refrigeration. To define would be to say that the anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant to absorb heat from an insulated vault area and maintain temperatures of  -10 f, 28 f, and 34 f. The process of absorbing takes place through evaporators that are suspended from the ceiling of the vaults. The anhydrous ammonia is pumped into these evaporator air handlers with the use of sealed pumps at the rate of 4 to 1 ratio. This means that 4 times the amount of refrigerant is pumped into the evaporator that can be boiled off during the refrigeration cycle. The refrigerant is then recycled to the pump packages. The screw compressors maintain the pressures required to maintain the desired temperature, by sucking the vapor off the top of the pump packages. This vapor is then compressed into a high-pressure gas and piped to an evaporative condenser on the roof of the facility. The high-pressure gas is then condensed by removing heat from the refrigerant pipes by passing water oan air over them, thus condensing the high-pressure gas into high-pressure liquid. This liquid then drains into a high pressure liquid receiver vessel. The level of refrigerant in the pump packages is maintained by a float switch allowing liquid refrigerant into the low stage and high stage pump packages, each having it's own float switch. This liquid is supplied by using liquid in the high pressure receiver. There, the process being performed is one of boiling (therefore absorbing heat) and condensiing (therefore refecting heat into the atmosphere) within a closed loop system.\n\nThe facility's approach to chemical safety is taken from the C&S Process Safety Management Program. Within the program are the following policies:\n \nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nWe have on-going pr"

Employees, management, insurance company, fire department, LEPC and contractors have been in attendance in these meetings when required and is all documented. Employees have been involved in every aspect of the PSM program. In 2002 the grocery aisles, the cutting room and the poultry room were converted to perishable maintaining 34 degrees F. This was accomplished by installing 4 new evaporators in these areas. The employees that were involved in maintaining the refrigeration plant were involved in every aspect of installation and fully instructed upon start-up. A full Management of Change report was written and all personnel were notified of the change. See section K of the Process Safety Management Book.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe contractor information that was compiled during construction is complete. Although we , through the process hazard analysis have approached all aspects of the information to confirm these facts. Since the process involved is one of refrigeration, the majority of the information needed is compiled on the MSDS. Toxicity permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, corrosuve data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazards of inadvertent mixing of different materials all are contained on the MSDS and are on file. It is also covered by our hazardous communication program posted in the warehouse.\n\nINFORMATION ON TECHNOLOGY OF THE PROCESS\n\nBlock flow diagrams have been made on a one-line diagram for simplicity. They include the zone valve locations for quick reaction by untrained eyes. The as built mechanical drawings and electrical diagrams are readily available in the maintenance office. They are updated to show changes that have occurred.\n\nMAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\nThe Cranston facility has 17000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.
