This document contains the necessary information to satisfy both the Program and Plan requirements of the RMP regulation. The Plan is the information that will be submitted to the EPA, Section 6.0.  This single submission will be deemed equivalent to a submission to the administrating agency, state, and local planning and response agencies with jurisdiction for the area where the stationary source is located.  The Program is the system that supports the plan and ensures that the plant is being operated safely.  A large portion of the Program information can be found in the Americold Process Safety Management (PSM) program document.

Following the on-site review, the hazard assessment was conducted to determine Maximum downwind distances to the listed concentration (200 ppm for ammonia).  Using these distances, the receptor data (including sensitive, environmental, and public receptors) were collected in addition to the population data within these zones.  Finally, the Risk Management Program and Plan document was developed.Americold,  established a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program at this facility in October, 2011.
