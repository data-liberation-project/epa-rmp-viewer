      "SummaryText": "BPU NEARMAN WATER TREATMENT PLANT:\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nRelease prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThe Board of Public Utilities, Kansas City, Kansas (BPU) takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at it's Nearman Water Treatment Plant (WTP) by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of processes subject to the Part 68 rule.  This training includes the safe handling of regulated substances under the rule.\nBPU has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules.  Though these rules do not specifically address the covered processes and their regulated substances, compliance with the general rules significantly reduces the potential for accidental releases of the regulated substances.  This facility complies with industry-standard practices for water treatment plants that use ammonia and chlorine in bulk. \nAs for emergency response, BPU has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and action.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  In general, BPU plant employees would deal only with releases of a small amount of a regulated substance.  If the release is determined to be large or if the chemical is stored outside or has migrated outside from a release indoors, BPU would immediately notify the Fire Department.\nBPU management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment at this facility and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in this document.\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \nBPU's Nearman WTP is a 36-million-gallon per day plant that treats raw water from underground wells in the Missouri River flood plain and provides drinking water to the community.  It does this through a series of physical and chemical treatment o"

The treated water, now ready for use by the public, is transferred to a large reservoir and pumped into the distribution system. \nThe regulated substances stored, handled, and used at this facility are chlorine and aqueous ammonia. The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 23 containers on site.  All of the chlorine containers are stored inside of a building.  The aqueous ammonia is stored in two 8,860-gallon tanks located outside but in a diked area to contain spills.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for aqueous ammonia was based on the results of the hazard review, experience at other similar facilities, and industry experience.  The choice for alternative release was a fill hose rupture between the tanker truck and storage tank and outside of the containment area.  It was assumed that auto shutoff valve fails but that the leak is manually stopped after two minutes.  The total amount of solution spilled on the ground is 1,850 pounds.  Through pooling and evaporation, the rate of gas release to the atmosphere is 46 pound per minute until all solution has evaporated.\nFor both analyses, the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used. \n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program for both chlorine and aqueous ammonia complies with EPA's 40 CFR part 68 rule for program 2 processes.  To maintain this compliance, BPU has in place many procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee-training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, and industry-standard systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of aqueous ammonia and chlorine.\nShould the prevention program fail to preven"

      "SummaryText": "t a release, the WTP is equipped with engineering controls designed to minimize the effect of the release on the surrounding community.  For chlorine, the storage containers are kept inside of a building to mitigate the effects of a release.  The plant also has a scrubber capable of neutralizing one ton of chlorine, the amount stored in the largest single container onsite.  The scrubber is maintained on a regular basis to ensure proper operation if needed during a chlorine release. \nThe aqueous ammonia tank is surrounded by a concrete secondary containment so that a spill of chemical will not flow away from the storage tank.  As with chlorine, the equipment in the ammonia process is operated and maintained by personnel properly trained in the hazards of the chemical and the process.\n\nFive-year accident history\nBecause this is a new facility, there is no accident history.\n\nEmergency response program  \nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency action plan that is coordinated with local response agencies, such as the Fire Department and local HAZMAT team.  The goals of the plan are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of the releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  It is also submitted to the Fire Department for review and comment.\nCity employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and aqueous ammonia and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\tDuring the development of the risk management plan, hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.

Each recommendation has been or is being considered and evaluated for implementation.  This evaluation process will provide all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
