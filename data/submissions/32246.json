The storage\nvessels are one ton cylinders and vary from one cylinder in\nthe winter months up to three cylinders in the summer\nmonths. In the past ten years the treatment plant has not\nexperienced any releases of liquid or gaseous chlorine of\nreportable amounts.\n\nChlorine safety has been an item of paramount importance to\nthe Company for many years. In 1981 all treatment plant\npersonal were required to attend chlorine safety training\nclasses that included daily chlorine operations and tank\nleak repair. Classes were continued on a yearly basis to\nassure up to date training. In 1990 the local fire\ndepartment was contacted to conduct the safety training\nclasses. The responsibility for tank leak repair was also\nturned over to the local fire department when new\nregulations made it impracticable to train all personal to\nthe new criteria.\n\nThe plant continues to keep emergency equipment including a\ntank repair kit, and self-contained breathing apparatus at\nthe site.\n\nIn 1987 the plant was upgraded and the chlorine room was\nisolated from the main plant, the entire room is visible\nthrough a glass window and external alarms are audible in\nthe main operations area. The chlorine room has external\naccess only. The feed system was changed to a totally vacuum\nsystem, which will shut the chlorine feed at the tank if\nvacuum is lost in the feed system. An additional alarm was\nadded for detection of any chlorine leakage in the chlorine\nroom and a chlorine exhaust system was installed.\n\nUsing the worst-case scenario on OCA Guidance a 0.9  mile\nradius from the plant was obtained, this agrees with the 1.0\nmile radius we hav"
