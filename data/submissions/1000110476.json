Due to our release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Saputo - Friendship plant developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo\u0092s Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate \u0096 Department of Refrigeration Services, Health & Safety, Risk Group and Department of Environmental affairs will improve compliance and overall plant safety."

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the Allegany County Fire Control, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Saputo - Friendship plant is located at 6701 County Road 20 in Friendship, NY, 14739. The plant's primary products include cottage cheese, sour cream, farmer's cheese and buttermilk. The facility employs approximately 335 full-time employees. There is one RMP-regulated substance on site. There are 2 separate systems which utilize anhydrous ammonia to support the cooling and refrigeration needs of the plant. Compressor Room 3 has a charge of 9483.4 lbs. and Compressor Room 4 has a charge of 6959.3 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. The two systems combined, account for an on-site total of 16443 pounds.\n?\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe Saputo - Friendship plant follows the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management program as a release prevention program for RMP.
