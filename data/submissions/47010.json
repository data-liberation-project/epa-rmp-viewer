Pelham Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) #58 (2004 Edition) for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage, and it is this facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Pelham Fire Department as well as the Mitchell County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Mitchell County Emergency Medical Service and Mitchell County Hospital (Archibald Hospital is the nearest trauma facility).  This Terminal does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.        The Texon, LP - Pelham Terminal is a butane transfer facility (specifically, rail car to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, incuding the associated piping and one (1) 30,000 - gallon storage tank (railcar).     This facility's worst case sceniario is the failure to transfer system's one (1) 30,000 - gallon railcar when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site to 0.4 miles and includes public receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) scenario is a \"pull away\" resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends to 0.005 miles and includes public receptors.      The Texon, L.P. Pelham Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This butane transfer system"

      "SummaryText": " is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA # 58 an the manufacturers (Texon, L.P.) instructions.       To date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane (new system) which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in-place.     In the event of an emergency involving the Texon, L.P. Pelham Terminal's butane transfer system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Pelham Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Terminal  currently has no trained fire brigade or hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Mitchell County LEPC.  The Pelham Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system."
