This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained personnel are at hand to initiate Immediate Response to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We also coordinate with the Whitfield County Fire Department which provide additional emergency response expertise and response. \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES The Dupont Dalton XPS site's primary activity encompasses Extruded Polystyrene Foam Production. One RMP-regulated flammable substance is handled and stored above threshold quantities at the facility, 1,1-Difluroethane (also known as HFC152a), which is used as a blowing agent for extruded polystyrene foam production. HFC-152a is received by isotainer and pumped to a storage tank where it is fed into the foam production process. \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY None at this time. \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM The Dalton XPS Site's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, and implementation of DuPont\u0092s Operating Discipline Management System. Key elements include Process Safety Information - We maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating p"

Process Hazard Analysis - Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses include Checklists, Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Dalton Site maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed per our operating discipline management system and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \nTraining - Our facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis, including recertification on qualified roles. \nMechanical Integrity - We carry out a highly documented Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, process safety instrumentation, controls, pumps, and compressors. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any"

      "SummaryText": "equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \nManagement of Change is completed for all modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions other than \"like for like\", by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementation of changes. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification. \nPre-startup Reviews - Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Dalton Site. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \nCompliance Audits - Self assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required, because of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \nIncident Investigation - The Dalton XPS Site promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \nEmployee Participation - The Dalton XPS Site believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, includi"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed. The Dalton XPS Site has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Emergency response plans are reviewed with the Whitfield County Fire Department, in the event the need for external services occurs. The Dalton XPS Site has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and government agencies as required, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. To ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to emergency situations, which can include chemical spills and releases. Critiques are held on drills and actual events."
