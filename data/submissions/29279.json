(\"Honda\") has developed and implemented two policies \nwhich directly impact and influence Honda's accident release prevention and emergency \nresponse activities.  First, Honda's Safety Policy expresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n- provide a safe and healthful working environment,\n- conduct its operations with the highest regard for associate safety,\n- continually improve the safety management system, \n- train associates in respects to safety related to their job, and\n- comply with all applicable safety and health requirements and standards mandated by \nfederal, state, and local law.\n\nSecond, Honda has developed and implemented an Environmental Policy which \nexpresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n- comply with all applicable environmental requirements mandated by federal, state, \nand local law,\n- operate and continually improve an environmental management system, and \n- implement methods to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources and reduce \nwaste.\n\nWith these policies as a foundation, Honda's Anna Engine Plant (Honda/AEP) has made \na significant effort to ensure compliance and good management in all areas relating to \nchemical safety.  Many of the Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements are similar or \nidentical to requirements covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the two Honda processes \nsubject to RMP regulation are already subject to PSM requirements.  Moreover, even \nbefore the OSHA PSM standard was adopted as a final rule, Honda/AEP maintained a \nhigh level of protection from potential chemical exposures for all AEP associates.  This \nwas accomplished through: operational controls, systems design, mechanical integrity\nand associate training.  Upon OSHA's final implementation of the PSM stand"

In many respects, procedures\nto prevent or control unwanted releases at Honda/AEP currently exceed PSM requirements\nrelative to mechanical integrity and associate training.  For example, Honda/AEP uses \nfixed head monitoring devices to detect leaks and/or releases, uses grade-specified \ncomponents, replaces hardware prior to manufacturer-suggested replacement intervals, \nand has implemented comprehensive associate training.\n\nA Brief Description of the AEP Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nHonda/AEP primarily consists of six manufacturing departments:.\n\n1. Aluminum Die Cast Department.\n\nIn the Aluminum Die Cast Department, raw aluminum ingots are melted in \naluminum furnaces.  The molten aluminum is then injected into dies either \nby low-pressure casting or by high-pressure casting.  Low pressure casting \nis used to produce engine cylinder heads.  High pressure casting is used to \nproduce engine blocks and transmission casings.\n\n2. Aluminum Machining Department.\n\nEngine blocks and cylinder heads from the Aluminum Die Cast Department \nare machined into finished products for use in the Engine Assembly \nDepartment.  \n\n3. Engine Assembly Department.\n\nThe Engine Assembly Department consists of three assembly lines.  \"3 line\" \nassembles the L-4 and V-6 engines.  \"1 line\" assembles \nfour cylinder engines for the Accord and Acura models.  \"2 line\" \nassembles four and six cylinder engines for the Accord and Acura models.\n\n4. Ferrous Casting Department.\n\nIn the Ferrous Casting Department, scrap metal is melted in a cupola and \npoured into sand molds to form brake disk rotors, brake drums, and \ncylinder sleeves.  In the Quick Cast Camshaft furnace, iron is melted and \npoured into an alloy die to make camshafts.  \nSulfur dioxide, a regulated substance, is used to \"cure\" or harden resin coated sand \ncores used in the "

Ferrous Machining Department.\n\nIn the Ferrous Machining Department, the brake disk rotors, brake drums, \nand cylinder sleeves poured in ferrous casting are machined into finished \nproducts.  Crankshafts are also machined and \nheat-treated.  Anhydrous ammonia and propane, regulated substances, are used in the \nheat-treating (nitriding) furnace to chemically harden the surface of the \ncrankshafts.\n \n(Note:  Because of a stay of Propane applicability issued by the U.S. Court of appeals on April 27, 1999, Honda's initial June 16, 1999 submittal did not address propane.  In light of the August 1999 Amendments to Section 112? of the Clean air Act set forth in the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act, and in light of the anticipated dismissal of the stay, Honda has revised its RMP to fully address Propane.\n \n6. Driveshaft Machining Department.\n\nIn the Driveshaft Machining Department, driveshafts are assembled for the \nAccord and Acura models.  Inboard, inner and outboard driveshaft parts are forged, machined and heat-treated.\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\n(Note:  because of concerns expressed by various governmental agencies regarding the public availability of hypothetical chemical release scenarios, as expressed in the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of August 1999, Honda has not provided descriptions of it's release scenarios in the Executive Summary.  The detailed descriptions, as required, are included in the RMP ducument itself.)\n\nHonda/AEP has only three regulated substances above currently effective threshold \nquantities: sulfur dioxide, anhydrous ammonia, and propane.

Consequently, Honda/AEP is submitting in its RMP a worst-case release scenario for sulfur dioxide (which has the greatest calculated distance to an endpoint) and alternative release scenarios for both sulfur dioxide and anhydrous ammonia.  For both regulated toxic substances, an environmental consultant was hired to perform computer modeling to predict the impact areas for release scenarios.  The consultant used the \"Process Hazard Analysis Software Tools (PHAST) model, versions 5.11, to model both chemicals in a gas state.  Honda is also submitting worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios for propane.  The worst-case and alterternative-case scenarios for propane were established by using EPA published guidance documents for propane storage facilities.\n\n1.    Sulfur Dioxide:\n\nSulfur dioxide is used in the disk core manufacturing process in the ferrous casting \ndepartment.  The disk cores are used in the manufacture of front brake disk rotors \nwhich will be mounted on the Accord, Civic and Acura models.  In this process, \ntwo types of sands and two different resins are first mixed together.  The mixed \ncore sands and resins are then blown into a \"core\" box.  Sulfur dioxide, \nwhich is stored as a liquid in cylinders located in the tank containment room, is \npumped to the core-making machine where it passes through a vaporizer and is \ntransformed into a gas.  A plate is placed over the core box and the sulfur \ndioxide gas is introduced through the plate into the core box to cure the resins.  The \nsulfur dioxide is purged from the core box by compressed air and vented to a \ncaustic soda scrubber for neutralization.  The finished cores are removed from the \ncore box and inspected prior to their use in the disk manufacturing process.   \n\nFor sulfur dioxide, the hypothetical worst-case release scenario was modeled \nusing an \"F\" atmospheric stability class based on a 10-minute instantaneous \nrelease from one of the sulfur diox"

The ammonia is pumped to the nitriding furnace through a series \nof immersion heaters where the liquid is vaporized into a gas.  Through overhead \npiping, the ammonia vapor travels through a shutoff header stand and a flowmeter \nstand prior to being introduced into the nitriding furnace.  \n\nDue to the high temperature (1,110 degrees Fahrenheit) the ammonia dissociates \ninto its components according to the following reaction:\n\n2 Anhydrous Ammonia -> 2 Nitrogen + 3 Hydrogen\n\nThe nitrogen combines with the alloying elements in the steel to form nitrides.  \nThe nitrides form at the steel surface as a hard chemical layer which will \nminimize wear and fatigue.

The flame curtains are used to keep oxygen and other gasses from entering the furnace contaminating the controlled atmosphere within the furnace.\n\nPropane is also used to react with ammonia within the furnace and the result is the increased surface hardness of the crankshaft.\n\nFor propane, the worst-case release was determined through the use of reference tables located in the RMP Guidance Document for Propane Storage Facilities.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the hypathetical release of propane was also determined through the use of reference tables in the RMP Guidance Document for Propane Storage Facilities.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention \nSteps at AEP:\n\nIn addition to being subject to the RMP requirements, Honda/AEP is subject to and \ncomplies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard to prevent \naccidental chemical releases from the disk core manufacturing process and the operation of the \nnitriding furnace.  Honda/AEP surpasses the requirements of various elements of the \nstandard, including response training, mechanical integrity and chemical-monitoring \ndevices to maintain high levels of compliance and prevent accidental releases.  \nMonitoring systems have built-in back up systems to insure fail-safe operation/detection \nand therefore are highly reliable.  The plant also exceeds training requirements and has \nappropriate material/equipment to control or stabilize process leaks and releases.  The \nAEP emergency response team conducts intensive annual training regarding chemical \nspecific response scenarios and maintains chemical specific response equipment.  As a \nresult, no significant accidental releases have occurred over the life of the various \nprocesses regulated by the PSM standard.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years, there have been two small releases of sulfur dioxide from both the \ntank storage area and the process area.  These releases resulted in minor inj"

Both releases did not result in any injuries or property damage.  The 5/10/02 release of ammonia is a process stack release that was reported to US EPA as a continuous release (#603302) due to the stable quantity and rate.  Modeling has been performed on the covered processes and is in compliance with Ohio EPA's Air Toxics Policy.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\nHonda of America Mfg., Inc., has developed a company-wide Emergency Response Plan \n(ERP), which explains Honda's commitment to emergency response.  This plan describes \nthe responsibility and procedures of Honda personnel and establishes a system in which the\nmembers of each plant's emergency response team work with local emergency \nresponse organizations.  This company-wide plan also serves as a model upon which the Honda/AEP \nemergency response team has based its own AEP-specific ERP.  The AEP plan outlines how \nthe Honda/AEP emergency response team is to work closely with the Anna Fire \nDepartment, the Shelby County Hazmat Team, and the Emergency Management Agency \nto promptly respond to any emergency.\n\nThe Honda/AEP Emergency Response Team (ERT) meets annually with the Village of \nAnna Fire Chief and members of its response team to review operations at the plant.  This \nmeeting also includes an in-depth tour of the plant that includes inspection of sumps, \nhydraulic pump pits and a thorough inspection of the roof. \n\nThe Anna Engine Plant Emergency Response Team is currently made up of 12 to 15 \nassociates on each of the three production shifts.  The members are volunteers who work \nfull-time in their respective production departments.  There are 3 full-time emergency \nresponse staff members, one for each shift, with one (on a rotating bas"

Each \nemergency response team member must meet Fire Fighter Level I state requirements as \ndefined in section 1001 of the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) manual and \nmust attend quarterly training classes and drills.  Training is taught on-site by an outside \ntraining contractor in accordance with NFPA, section 600 requirements.  Additionally, 5 \nto 10 emergency response team members on each shift are trained to the Hazmat \nTechnician level as defined in OSHA section 1910.120 requirements.  \n\nThe emergency response team members are activated by procedures identified in the AEP \nEmergency Response Plan.  If plant security, which covers the plant switchboard 24 \nhours a day, receives an emergency call, they are trained to activate the alarm system and \nalert the emergency response pagers.  The response team will be activated and respond \nusing procedures identified in the response plan.\n\nOutside agencies are activated by plant security by dialing 911 in the event that the \nresponse team requests their assistance or if the response team is not available to respond \nat full strength.
