The same properties that make this chemical valuable for making drinking water safe also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of our chlorination system to control human and environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities.  \n\nIt is Coastal Water Authority\u00bfs policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  However, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount at CWA and we often exceed standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management at CWA.  Senior management\u00bfs commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment. \n\nFacility Description and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Red Bluff plant site covers approximately 4 acres within the Pasadena City limits.  It is located at 120 North Red Bluff, Pasadena, Texas in Harris County. Our facility is designed to treat a maximum of 9,000,000 gallons of water per day.\n\nThere is a maximum of six (6) full-time employees at the plant site at any one time. \n\nWe presently handle only one chemical, which is considered toxic by the EPA.

It is received into the plant in one ton containers.  These containers are standard DOT and Chlorine Institute specified containers.  Deliveries of chlorine are received at the plant every three (3) months.  The plant has a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds of chlorine onsite; however, only one container (2,000 pounds) is being used at any one time.  \n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nCoastal Water Authority contracted with an outside engineering firm to assist in the development of a prevention program tailored exclusively to water treatment operations.  This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective of our prevention program is to ensure complete containment of chlorine through safe operation and maintenance of the chlorination system.  \n\nAlthough newly developed, the prevention program has been designed with the following objectives:\n\u00bfEnhancement of the mechanical integrity of all chlorine equipment and piping,\n\u00bfCompilation of safety information to improve hazard awareness, and\n\u00bfTraining to increase hazard recognition\n\nFive year accident history\n\nCWA has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  This process is defined and explained by CWA-008.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.  \n\nFormal investigations are required to be conducted by appointed teams knowledgeable in operations or equipment being investigated.  Root cause and corrective actions are also required in order to determine incident prevention steps.  Progress regarding corrective action on all investigated incidents is required to be tracked through to completion.\n\nCoastal Water Authority\u00bfs Red Bluff plant"

We have made a concise decision to not respond to catastrophic releases of chlorine at the Red Bluff plant.  Our employees have been instructed notify the Pasadena Fire Department and Pasadena LEPC and to evacuate in the event of such an incident.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule, CWA is included in the Pasadena, Texas local emergency response plan under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). \n\nPlanned improvements to reduce risk\n\nInvestigation of inherently safer technologies presented by the Chlorine Institute, chlorine inventory reduction studies, and fail safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at CWA.  Safety depends upon our management commitment, the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent to our chlorination system, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our employees."
