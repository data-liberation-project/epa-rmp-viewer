      "SummaryText": "Republic Plastics owns and operates a polystyrene foam products manufacturing facility located in Eloy, Arizona. The facility is designed to manufacture polystyrene products which involves the use and storage of isobutane and polystrene pellets, the pressurization of isobutane gas in a high pressure building, extrusion, roll storage and aging, thermoforming and stamping, and fluff reclamation. The equipment associated with the production of foam products consists of extruders, thermoformers, pellet feed silos, fluff surge hoppers, and associated storage and packaging areas.\n\n\n\nSection 112&reg; of the Clean Air Act applies to the Republic Plastics facility in Eloy because the facility handles and stores isobutane, a RMP-regulated flammable gas, in excess of threshold quantities. Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n\n\n1. Section 112&reg;(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Republic Plastics is committed to ensuring the safe operation of its butane facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Republic Plastics, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the facility and community-wide by coordinating with the local Fire Department.\n\n\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The Republic Plastics facility handles and stores isobutane in excess of the threshold specified in Section 112&reg;. Republic Plastics management is aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of a flammable gas. Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases\n\nand to train personnel for emergency"

These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP definition for a process, the facility is defined as the isobutane tank located outside, and associated piping and pumps leading up to the high pressure building and distribution of the isobutane to the extruders.\n\n\n\nRepublic Plastics has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Operating and maintenance procedures, training, and inspection practices and/or procedures in place. In addition, Republic Plastics has coordinated with the local fire department.\n\nRepublic Plastics management is committed to:\n\n* Preventing accidents;\n\n* Training their employees in correct procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n* Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n* Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Republic Plastics\n\noperations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n* Being a good corporate citizen of Eloy Arizona.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about\n\nour management of the risks associated with the isobutane process. Most important, Republic Plastics\n\nstresses its commitment to ensuring safe operation for its employees, its visitors, and its community.\n\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Republic Plastics is in compliance with corresponding\n\nOSHA PSM and EPCRA requirements. Republic Plastics has conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA) on the\n\nisobutane process and is currently implementing recommendations made to further improve the safe\n\noperation of this process."
