      "SummaryText": "Like most food storage facilties, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant  available for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nUS Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\nmerely responding to problems.  Our RMP program includes elements addressing:\n\n(1) Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\n(2) Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n(3) Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n\n(4) Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n\n(5) Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n(6) Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\n(7) Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n\n(8) Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\n\n(9"

      "SummaryText": ") Contractors: We carefully screen contractors who work on our property to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n\n(10) Hot Work Permits: We strictly control welding and other work that could start a fire near the ammonia equipment.\n\n(11) Emergency Response: We coordinate our response to emergencies with the local Fire Department.\n\n(12) Incident Investigation: After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n\n(13) Compliance Audits: Approximately every year, we examine the safety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n\n(14) Trade Secrets: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets program in case confidential information affecting the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n\n(15) Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing progress of safety items.\n\nAs stipulated by 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1), the \"worst-case\" and \"alternate case\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios were calculated and the results are on file at the facility and have been submitted to EPA in accordance with applicable regulations.\n\nWe used the EPA's ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate hazard levels.\n(See the Risk Management Plan,available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)\n\n"
