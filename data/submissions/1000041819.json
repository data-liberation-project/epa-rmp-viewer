Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 15 states. Fifteen processing facilities produce about 56 million pounds of poultry products each week. Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 12 largest US grain companies. In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, and livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\n\n\nThe Perdue Farms, Gainesville Cook Plant is a poultry processing plant located south of Gainesville, Georgia at the junction of I-985 and Candler Road.  The facility is located in an industrial area with the closest residences to the northeast and to the north. The facility is a chicken cooking process plant which employs approximately 400 associates to receive chicken and turkey meat plus other raw ingredients to form, prepare and package for distribution to the market place. The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at the Gainesville facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717). The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in its cooling system. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia used in this process is approximately 23,780 pounds, distributed throughout various refrigeration components (compressor, pressure vessels, condensers, etc.). The majority of the refrigeration components are located on the roof, though piping is located throughout the facility.  The facility maintains a full time refrigeration maintenance staff that conducts multiple service inspections on a daily basis. In addition there is a computer control system that monitors temperatures, pressures, and t"
