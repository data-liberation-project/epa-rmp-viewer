We are proud of our safety record and strive to ensure that we design and operate our facility so that hazards are minimized and risks controlled.\n\nWe use a refrigeration process to maintain appropriate temperatures at critical control points in our\noperation. Anhydrous ammonia, the refrigerant used in this process, is regulated by EPA under 40CFR part\n68 and by OSHA under 29CFR 1910.119. We have specific programs and practices in place for controlling this\nprocess to help ensure that a harmful release of ammonia does not occur. These programs and practices\ninclude:\n- Use of recognized good engineering practices in the design, installation and operation of our refrigeration\nequipment and ensuring this equipment meets applicable codes and standards.\n- Continual assessment of hazards and safeguards in our process, in order to reduce risks.\n- Use of release prevention practices that have been recognized as effective by Federal and State experts.\n- Maintaining preparedness for responding to any emergency that may occur. Using EPA-approved methods and technology, we have analyzed worst-case and alternative scenarios for the unlikely release of ammonia from our Refrigeration Process. The results of these analyses, including any public or environmental receptors are available upon request to facility management and/or from the US EPA.\nOur release prevention program focuses on preventing hazardous releases of anhydrous ammonia. Our\nequipment and management practices are consistent with OSHA regulations and recognized good\nengineering practices specified by ASHRAE, ASME and ASTM standards. In the unlikely event that a release of\nammonia were to occur, monitoring devices would immediately alert us so that quick action can be taken to\nminimize the impact. \n\nWe are continually seeking ways to improve the safety of"
