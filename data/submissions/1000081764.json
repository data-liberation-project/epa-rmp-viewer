The facility is located on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids, Iowa at the intersection of 41st Avenue Drive and C Street Southwest.  This ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified facility employs approximately 200 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.\n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures enzymes, fermentates, and whole cells for food, animal feed, and industrial use through a fermentation based process.  Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The facility's enzyme products are available in liquid or granular form.  The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has maintenance and laboratory support.  Support staff includes site management, environmental, health and safety (EHS), engineering, purchasing, finance, and systems personnel.\n\n\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria.  The enzyme manufacturing process requires the use of ammonium hydroxide at 29.9% concentration.  Maximum on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide solution is approximately 130,000 liters.  The ammonium hydroxide Risk Management Program (RMP) covers ammonium hydroxide unloading operations, storage, transfer, and fermentation operations.  The site uses the terms aqueous ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, and ammonia throughout documentation to describe the covered process.\n\n\n\nChemical Safety\n\n\n\nThe site's overall approach to chemical safety is comprehensive.  Systems are engineered with safety and environmental aspects in mind, with input from all affected areas of the plant prior to construction or use.  The goal is to provide a safe workplace while minimizing environmental impact.  Release prevention methods are im"

      "SummaryText": "vironmental events are addressed immediately to prevent the escalation of an incident if possible.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe DuPont, Cedar Rapids Facility has had one incident in the last 5-years involving the ammonium hydroxide system that resulted in on-site or off-site impacts.\n\n\n\n?    3/18/2015 there was a release on-site that led to the release of 55 lb. of ammonia.  As a result of the release, there were two medical treatment cases.\n\n\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs part of an on-going safety review, a multi-session Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted for the site aqueous ammonia hydroxide system between August 2013 and April 2014 and then again in July 2017 as part of the cyclic PHA reviews.  The next cyclic PHA review is scheduled for 2022.  Recommendations from the PHAs improve the safety of the ammonium hydroxide system and include all appropriate hazard analysis.    \n\n\n\nThe PHA process is led by the site Process Safety Management (PSM) Engineer and/or Leader, who are trained internally by DuPont to lead PHAs.  The PHA included a team of DuPont IB, Cedar Rapids members representing Logistics (process), Fermentation (process), Maintenance, Engineering, and EHS.  The PHA recommendations and historical information is documented in the site's Final PHA Report Aqueous Ammonia Baseline (PS-Form-032).  \n\n\n\nAny change related to the ammonium hydroxide system will be tracked through the site Management of Change process which includes a hazard review and a detailed listed of requirements to ensure the change is properly documented.\n\n"
