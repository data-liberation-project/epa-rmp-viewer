The facility has developed and implemented an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which includes procedures for evacuation, notification of the public and local first responders, procedures for response to chlorine releases, and information on first aid in the case of exposure.\nMonterey One Water has submitted a Hazardous Materials Business Plan and implements coordination with the local emergency planning and response agencies for ERP exercises to ensure that in an event of an emergency they are properly prepared and have knowledge of the system.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe April 1st, 2024 PHA has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the April 2024 PHA Report. Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed by October 1st, 2026. The facility has also conducted a Seismic Assessment in 2021, to test for facility integrity of external events. The results of the Seismic Assessment were documented in a formal report to attest the integrity of the facility."

The facility has chlorine detectors that are designed to shut down operations when a concentration of chlorine is reached.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \nAs part of the implementation of the CalARP/EPA RMP Program for the Chlorination System, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Monterey One Water to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine for water treatment.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nThe facility\u0092s maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 52,000 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 2,500-lbs. threshold for EPA RMP, the 1,500-lbs. threshold for Cal/OSHA PSM and the 100-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the chlorine covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.1 Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.2 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.3 Operating Procedures (OP)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.4 Training (TRN)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.5 Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.6 Management of Change (MOC)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.7 Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.8 Compliance Audits (CA)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.9 Incident Investigation (II)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.10 Employee Participation (EP)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.11 Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.12 Contractors (CON)\nIn addition, key emergency re"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Sewage Treatment System. Monterey One Water's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \nChlorine is injected into the sewage treatment system in order to disinfect it. The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 52,000 pounds of chlorine kept in twenty-six (26) one-ton containers. Chlorine leak detection and warning is provided by high and low chlorine sensor alarms to control room with an audible and visual alarm system. \n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis must be reviewed every five (5) years or within six (6) months of process changes or other changes that may significantly affect the results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one (1) worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Sewage Treatment System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one (1) alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Sewage Treatment System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, Monterey One Water has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-cas"
