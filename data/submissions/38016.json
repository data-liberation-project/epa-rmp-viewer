The starch slurry is then rinsed in water into which additional vaporized SO2 is injected.  \n\nDuring the primary separation process (starch/gluten) SO2 is also added.  This starch slurry is \n\nutilized in the production of high fructose corn syrup.\n\n\n\nThe Wet Mill Department is responsible for the storage and transfer of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is \n\nutilized in the corn milling process.

Emergency situations can include fire, explosion, chemical release or spill, bomb \n\nthreat, weather emergencies and other natural emergencies.  Due to the ongoing risks that are \n\npresented by weather emergencies like tornadoes, the plant has in place an emergency plan to \n\nprotect both the plant operational integrity and the safety of its workers and neighbors from \n\nweather emergencies.
