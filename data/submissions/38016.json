The steeped corn then travels through \r\ndegerminating mills and separation processes designed to remove the germ and separate out the \r\nstarch.  The starch slurry is then rinsed in water into which additional vaporized SO2 is injected.  \r\nDuring the primary separation process (starch/gluten) SO2 is also added.  This starch slurry is \r\nutilized in the production of high fructose corn syrup.\r\n\r\nThe Wet Mill Department is responsible for the storage and transfer of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is \r\nutilized in the corn milling process.

However, by the use of interlocks the maximum amount that can be stored in the SO2 \r\nstorage tank, at any given time, is 228,000 lbs.  The storage tank is filled approximately once \r\nevery 3 to 4 weeks via 90-ton railcar.  Access to the loading area is limited by chain link fence and \r\nsecured by locks.  \r\n\r\n3 .0  OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of the Risk Management Program Cargill Sweeteners has conducted an assessment of \r\nthe off-site consequences of the worst-case and alternative releases.  The worst-case release is \r\ndefined as the sudden release of the entire contents of the single vessel containing the largest \r\namount of SO2, during conditions of limited atmospheric mixing.  The alternative release relates to \r\na scenario that is more likely than the worst case and which occurs during typical meteoroligical \r\ncondtions.  Changes to the Risk Management Plan requirements, promulgated by EPA in April \r\n2004, prohibit inclusion of off-site consquence information in the Executive Summary portion of \r\nthe Risk Management Plan.  Information pertianing to this assessment is included in the RMP \r\ndata elements. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 .0  ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nSome processes subject to the Risk Management Regulation are also subject to Occupational \r\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).  PSM \r\ngoverns the same processes and regulated substances at the site that are subject to 40 CFR \r\nPart 68.  Cargill has a PSM program at the Wahpeton plant that includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n- Employee Training and Participation \r\n\r\n- Process Safety Information \r\n\r\n- Process Hazards Analysis \r\n\r\n- Operating Procedures \r\n\r\n- Training\r\n\r\n- Contractors\r\n\r\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\n- Hot Work Permit\r\n\r\n- Management of Change \r\n\r\n- Incident Investigation"

If a chemical release is \r\ndetected on-site, the emergency response team is notified and the most appropriate mode of \r\nresponse is determined by the Incident Commander, with support from available emergency \r\nresponse (HAZ-MAT) teams and technical advisory staff.  Each Department in the facility must \r\nalso follow a specific Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control Plan in the event of a chemical \r\nrelease. \r\n\r\nPlant operations at the Wahpeton facility can present various types of potential hazards and \r\nCargill recognizes the need to have a well trained and prepared work force to safely and \r\neffectively deal with any emergency situation.  The Cargill Wahpeton facility provides training of \r\nresponsible staff and the exercise of important communication links with the community, in order \r\nto maintain an appropriate state of readiness for emergency situations.  Cargill Wahpeton plant \r\nstaff attend periodic meetings with local industry and emergency response planning officials and \r\nhave participated in emergency response training exercises.  Cargill teams have a \u00bfFirst \r\nResponse\u00bf capability and are able to administer basic first aid and CPR.  Cargill and local \r\nemergency response planning officials also rely on the St. Francis Hospital, Dwight/Wahpeton \r\nFire Department, and Dwight/Wahpeton Ambulance to offer paramedical assistance and \r\ntransportation to the Health Center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 .0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\n\r\nCargill\u00bfs Wahpeton plant, under the recent RMP program, as well as its existing PSM and earlier \r\nSARA Title III Community Right-to-Know Act compliance programs has organized its \r\nmanagement system to effectively address hazards and potential risks.

The incident \r\ninformation is reviewed and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any \r\nchemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate \r\nauthorities are notified.\r\n\r\nSince the start of operations at the Wahpeton facility in October 1996, there has been no accident \r\ninvolving any RMP regulated substance that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.  This \r\nmeans that no accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, emergency \r\nresponse, or damage to property or the environment.\r\n\r\n6 .0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nCargill\u00bfs Wahpeton plant has established an Emergency Action Plan that is designed to address \r\nforeseeable emergency situations at the facility and provide appropriate hazard and emergency \r\npreparedness information to employees, contractors, emergency response personnel, and the \r\ncommunity.  Emergency situations can include fire, explosion, chemical release or spill, bomb \r\nthreat, weather emergencies and other natural emergencies.  Due to the ongoing risks that are \r\npresented by weather emergencies like tornadoes, the plant has in place an emergency plan to \r\nprotect both the plant operational integrity and the safety of its workers and neighbors from \r\nweather emergencies.  In regards to chemical releases, Cargill has developed a command \r\nstructure and specific procedures that must be adhered to in the unlikely event of a chemical \r\nemergency.  These procedures define the criteria for identifying, classifying, and notifying the \r\nappropriate emergen"
