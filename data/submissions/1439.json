The facility utilizes chlorine in one-ton capacity cylinders with a maximum of three cylinders stored at the facility. \n\nThe  EPA Risk Management Program Rule requires that covered facilities handling chlorine evaluate a Worst-Case Scenario for one-ton chlorine cylinders that assumes a sudden catastrophic cylinder failure  with atmospheric conditions classified at the most stable of possible conditions. The facility's worst-case scenario has been developed utilizing all assumptions required by the EPA Risk Management Program Rule and scenario modeling information from the American Water Works Association's (AWWA)  \"Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants.\" The worst-case scenario assumes an ambient temperature of 111 degrees F. which is the highest temperature recorded in the area during the previous 3 years based upon Tulsa Oklahoma Climatological Data.  Due to the abundance of nearby trees and the uneven terrain, the topography is classified as Urban for purposes of evaluating the worst-case scenario. Use of the AWWA scenario modeling information indicates that a worst-case scenario, involving a catastrophic failure of a chlorine cylinder and other assumptions required by the EPA Risk Management Program Rule, would have off-site public impact. \n\nAn Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for chlorine has also been evaluated. This scenario assumes the release of chlorine gas through a 5/16-inch diameter valve opening due to an incident such as a tubing failure, bad connection or valve failure. The ARS evaluated involves a 317 pound release of chlorine at a maxi"

The ARS also assumes Class D atmospheric Stability, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, relative humidity of 50%, and a temperature of 77 degrees F. Due to the abundance of nearby trees and the uneven terrain, the topography is classified as Urban for purposes of evaluating the ARS. \n\nScenario modeling information from the AWWA's \"Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants\" was utilized in evaluating the ARS. Use of the AWWA guidelines, with the assumptions as specified in the previous paragraph, indicates that the ARS would have off-site public impact. \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Rule requires that covered facilities report the number of accidental releases during the past five years. The Tahlequah facility has experienced zero (0) chlorine releases in the past five years. \n\nThe Tahlequah facility is attended at all times with trained operators, including personnel who are recognized as Certified Water Works Operators by the Oklahoma State Department of Health.   To help ensure the safety of chlorine operations the facility maintains the following information and programs: chlorine safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, training, and compliance audits. \n\nThe facility maintains an emergency action plan that includes instructions for immediately  requesting assistance from the Tahlequah Fire Department in the event of an emergency release of chlorine and for making appropriate notifications to public agencies. Information has been provided to the Cherokee County LEPC for coordinating the facility's plans with the community emergency response plans. The facility continually strives to improve the safety of its operations. Current improvement actions include expanding the library of available literature on chlorine safety and continuing to coordinate emergency preplanning with the City of Tahlequa"
