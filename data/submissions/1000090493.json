Safety and security of the chemicals is guided by applicable local, state, and federal regulations and/or industry standards.  Security is specifically addressed through a security and vulnerability assessment (SVA)  performed under the the DHS guidelines.  \n\n\n\n1.1      Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nThe containers are unloaded from a delivery vehicle for various periods of time, and then are loaded and delivered to the final user.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Rinchem Company Inc. manages the safety of the regulated processes as identified in Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with engineering controls, aministrative controls and industry best practices.\n\n\n\n1.2      The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and the redelivery of a variety of compressed gases Hydrogen Chloride, Arsine, and Chlorine and chemicals to the end user. The regulated substances are delivered to this facility in portable, DOT approved, shipping and storage containers. They are stored here until needed by the final user, at which time they are inspected prior to shipment and loaded onto a transport vehicle and delivered to the final user location.  There is no chemical reaction involved, and neither is there any transfer of product from one container to another.  \n\n\n\n1.3      The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan along with the OSHA PSM rule.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\nChemical specific prevention steps begin with the decision that all regulated substances would be on-site for storage only.

The facility maintains an Site Emergency Action Plan (SEAP) that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release. This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.    \n\n\n\n1.6      Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and incident investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the facility design and operating procedures."
