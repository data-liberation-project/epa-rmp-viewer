Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. facility located in York, Pennsylvania to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. is located at 4875 Susquehanna Trail, in York, Pennsylvania.  The facility is approximately 0.25 miles north of Interstate 94.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light commercial and industrial areas.  Construction of the ammonia refrigeration system at C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc.'s York facility was completed in late August 2006.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and to IIAR guidelines.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing 27,011 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high"

Typical operating conditions range from 1.7 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 165 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrig"

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  \n\nThere are two ammonia sensors located in the Engine Room.  The first detector is set to 25ppm and this is tied into the computer system alarm, which alerts the automated communication software and activates the amber audible and visible alarm outside the engine room as well as a buzzer inside the engine room.  Upon detection of an ammonia concentration at, or above, 100 ppm (East Engine Room Sensor), the detection system will initiate the ventilation fans and alarm at the computer control panel and activates the blue light outside the engine room. The second detector is set to 25ppm and this is tied to the computer system alarm, which alerts the automated communication software and activates the amber audible and visible alarm outside the engine room as well as a buzzer inside the engine room. Upon detection of an ammonia concentration at, or above, 200 ppm (West Engine Room Sensor), the detection system will alarm at the computer control panel and closes the hot gas and liquid king valves.  It also shuts down the Engine Room and the HAVC units to the facility, in addition the detection system will initiate the ventilation fans and alarm at the computer control panel and activates the blue light outside the engine room If off-site, operators will then return to the facility to investigate the situation, at which time a determination as to the appropriate response will be made.  \n\nThere are also ammonia detectors located within the dock, ice room, and penthouse areas which, upon detection of an ammonia concentration at, or "

The Vent Line Stack detector is set at 1000 pmm, the detector will alarm the Computer Control Panel and shut down all the HVAC units to the facility.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the reportable quantity of 100 pounds within the last five years (August 2016 - August 2011). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n- save lives;\n\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- protect the environment; and\n\n- minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe original Process Hazard Analysis, performed on August 22 & 23, 2006, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. facility located in York, Pennsylvania.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York safety committee completed these recommendations as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
