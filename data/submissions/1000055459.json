      "SummaryText": "GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n\n\nPorex - St. Charles currently uses and stores Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) (TDI) in quantities up to 50,000 lbs. TDI has a CAS #26471-62-5. Per 48 CFR 68 ? 68.130, TDI has a Threshold Quantity of 10,000 lbs. (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2004). TDI falls under the Toxic Liquid classification per the Roadmap to Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2009). The site has a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 326150 and a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code of 3086. \n\n\n\nBASIS FOR CALCULATIONS\n\n\n\nPorex - St. Charles is subject to 48 CFR 68 based on the following criteria -\n\n? The owner or operator of a stationary source - YES (Porex - St. Charles)\n\n? That has more than a threshold quantity - YES (> 10,000 lbs.)\n\n? Of a regulated substance - YES (TDI)\n\n? In a process. - YES (Storage and Use) (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2004)\n\nWith that being said the following information is used to calculate the Distance to a Toxic Endpoint per the Risk Management Program (RMP) Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2009). Once a determination of Distance to Toxic Endpoint has been made, the determination of which level (I, II, or III) St. Charles is at can be decided. With the level defined Porex can then determine if an alternate release scenario calculation is necessary.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONCEQUENCE ANALYSIS - WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe steps for performing the analysis are specifically given in the guidance document. So working through the list we find the following information -\n\n? TDI is considered a TOXIC LIQUID per Exhibit B-2 and its use in our particular process.\n\n? For the worst-case analysis our largest single vessel is capable of holding 50,000 lbs. of TDI.\n\n? The highest daily max. temperature of TDI based on process temperature data is 85 ?F (29.4 ?C).\n\n? Also per Exhibit B-2 and Appendix D, TDI is considered a "

Based on the 40 CFR 68.22(e), Porex is in an URBAN setting.\n\n \n\nNext we follow the Worst-Case Analysis for Toxic Liquids given in Section 1.5.2 of the Guidance. \n\n\n\nSTEP 1 - The worst-case release scenario would happen when the largest capacity TDI tank had a leak at the welded fitting near the outlet of the tank. Because this leak would occur upstream of any valves there would not be an effective means of stopping the release of all of the contents (50,000 lbs.) into the diked area surrounding the TDI tanks. I would not expect this release to be violent enough to cause a rupture in the adjacent tank. \n\n\n\nSTEP 2 - Estimate the release rate. Using \"3.2.3 Releases of Toxic Liquids with Passive Mitigation\" (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2009). Compare the maximum area of a pool at a depth of one centimeter to the diked area.\n\n\n\nA = QS?DF = 20,000 square feet                (Equation 3-6)\n\nQS = Quantity released in pounds (50,000 lbs.)\n\nDF = Density Factor (0.4 for TDI from Appendix B, Exhibit B-2)\n\n\n\nA = Maximum area of pool = 20,000 square feet\n\nDiked Area = (11.5 ft. ? 13 ft.) + (22 ft. ? 22 ft.) = 633.5 square feet\n\nSince the diked area is significantly smaller than the pooled area we use the following equation to calculate the release rate.\n\n\n\nQR = 1.4 ? LFA ? A = 0.0532                     (Equation 3-7)\n\nQR = Release rate (pounds / minute)\n\n1.4 = Wind speed factor for the worst-case scenario\n\nLFA = Liquid Factor Ambient (0.000006 from Appendix B, Exhibit B-2)\n\nA = Diked area (633.5 square feet)\n\n\n\nBecause our process temperature is 29.4 ?C we need to use the release rate correction for toxic liquids released at temperatures between 25 ?C and 50 ?C. After finding the Temperature Correction Factor (TCF) in Appendix B, Exhibit B-4 we plug into the following equation -\n\n\n\nQR_C = QR ? TCF = 0.008514                    (Equation 3-11)\n\n\n\nBecau"

      "SummaryText": "se our storage and use of TDI is contained in one room inside of a building we also have to apply the correction factor for a release occurring in a building. So the correction factor is -\n\n\n\nQR_B = 0.1 ?QR_C=0.000851                    (Equation 3-10)\n\n\n\nWe also need to determine if there is a potential for the diked area to overflow from a release this size. The volume of the spill is equal to surface area of pooled spill (20,000 square feet) times one centimeter (0.033 feet) or 660 cubic feet. The volume of the diked area is the surface area (633.5 square feet) times the depth of the area (two feet) or 1267 cubic feet. So we would only fill the diked area to a depth of one foot in this worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nNow that we have estimated the release rate and the total quantity spilled we can calculate the duration of vapor release from the release. The maximum duration (t) is going to be quantity of release (50,000 lbs.) divided by corrected release rate (0.000851 pounds / minutes) or 58,754,406 minutes.\n\n\n\nWith all of that done we can now go Exhibit B-2 to find the Toxic Endpoint for TDI which is 0.0070 milligrams / Liter. Now we can finally go to the Reference Tables in the RMP Guidance on OCA to figure out the Distance to Toxic Endpoint. Using Exhibit 2 which led to Reference Table #4. We just need to divide the release rate by the Toxic Endpoint to cross reference that answer in the table to the Distance to Endpoint. \n\n\n\nSo the number we are looking for becomes 0.000851 / 0.007 = 0.122 which falls into the 0 - 26 category or a Distance to Endpoint of 0.1 miles (528 ft.).\n\n\n\nThe closest public receptor to the TDI process equipment is Able Welding & Storage.  This business is about 182 ft. from the prepolymer manufacturing building, and 125 ft from the foam-manufacturing site.  We have a direct connection with the Tri-Township Fire Department for emergency response. The facility uses administrative controls to limit the amount of TDI present at any one time, as to maintain a TD"

This room can only exhaust air through a scrubber, which neutralizes TDI vapors.  All related personnel are trained at least annually and have access to all necessary safety equipment for proper handling. Spill response training is also included for appropriate personnel. Regular safety meetings update any changes to keep safety issues current. The safe manner in which this facility is handled has resulted in no accidental releases in the history of the facility.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONCEQUENCE ANALYSIS - ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nPorex considered a larger area of the building being contaminated due to the spill. Because the larger area is still enclosed as in the worst case scenario. The Distance to Endpoint is still 0.1 miles."
