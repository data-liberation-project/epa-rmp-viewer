      "SummaryText": "The current water treatment facility in Greenville was constructed in 1980. It is a lime softening plant with a design average capacity of four million gallons per day and a maximum design flow of six million gallons per day.\n\nGreenville has two sources of high quality water. The primary source of water is the Greenville Creek which is a scenic river and accounts for approximately seventy percent of the raw water that is treated. There are also nine wells that are available during periods when there is high turbidity levels in the stream (after heavy rains or snow thaws). The plant is designed to use either source individually or a combination of both. \n\nThe Greenville Creek intake has a traveling water screen with an automatic spray wash. There are four pumps located at this intake. Three of the pumps are rated at 3 million gallons per day and the fourth pump is rated at 1.5 million gallons per day. The raw water is pumped to the rapid mix chamber where the lime slurry, sodium hydroxide, and aluminum sulfate are applied and completely mixed with the water. The water then flows to two solids contact units. These tanks serve as both flocculation zones and clarifiers. The chemicals react with hardness causing substances in the water. These particles then settle out of the water to form lime sludge.\n\nAfter filtration, the water is chlorinated and flows to a one million gallon underground tank called a clearwell. The water is stored here until it is pumped to the distribution system.\n\nSTAFF\nThe water treatment plant is staffed 24 hours per day. The water department employs 4 Water Treatment Operators, 2 Maintenance/Relief Operators, 1 Laboratory Technician, 2 Distribution Maintenance Operators, and 1 Superintendent. Of these personnel, there are five Class III operators, one Class II operator, and two Class I operators.\n\nWhen dealing with Chlorine Safety, the Water Department has taken a proactive approach. The Department has installed a Wallace & Tiernan Acutech 35 Gas"

      "SummaryText": "Detection System. This dual point unit has one sensor transmitter unit located in the Chlorine Storage room and one sensor/transmitter unit located in the injector room. This unit also has a electrochemical Gas Generator that performs a self test every 24 hours. This Auto Test feature verifies the proper operation of the gas detection system.  A Wallace & Tiernan V Notch system is used for Chlorine injection. This is an all vacuum system from the Chlorine cylinder to the injector. There are no lines under pressure and if a leak occurs after the cylinder, the vacuum is lost and the regulator will shut. The Water Department also has a Chlorine Emergency B Kit on site for ton  cylinders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      If any Chlorine incident occurs, plant personnel immediatley notify The City of Greenville Fire Department. The City's Fire Department is manned by 27 personnel: \none Chief, one Assistant Chief, three Captains, eighteen Firefighters, one Secretary, and three Auxiliary Firefighters. The Greenville FD has full Hazmat Response capability.\n \nEquipment: All equipment carried in inventory to meet FEMA Type 3 Hazmat Entry Team specifications.\n \nTraining:  All FD personnel (26) trained to the Hazmat Operations level with 17 trained to the Technician level.\n \nAlso, the Darke Co. Hazmat Team is used as back-up and they also have the full FEMA Type 3 Hazmat Entry Team equipment in inventory."
