The facility contains anhydrous ammonia in three storage tanks located along the south side of the facility. The storage vessels, piping, pumps, and formulation equipment are interconnected. The facility is manned five days per week during daylight hours. Yardsmen can/will assist the fire department in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n    - High level of training of the operators.\r\n    - Preventative maintenance programs.\r\n    - Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\r\n    - Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\r\n    - Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\r\n    - Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\r\n\r\nChemical specific prevention steps include close visual monitoring of all process equipment, emergency shutoffs, availability of respiratory protection equipment for immediate use, capture of minor fugitive vapor releases from hose connections, sensitivity to weather conditions that may affect an emergency situation, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of ammonia.\r\n\r\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nThe facility has an emergency response progr"
