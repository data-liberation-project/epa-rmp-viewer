The facility manufactures the refrigerant gas 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (KLEA 134a).  The facility has been in operation since December 1992 and currently employes 80 people (including contract workers).  Although KLEA 134a is the primary product, the facility also produces hydrochloric acid as a process by-product.\n\nKLEA 134a is the ozone friendly replacement refrigerant for CFC12.  It is used in automotive air conditioners, refrigerators, freezers, appliances (both home and commercial), and has many other consumer uses.  It is also purified to a medical-grade for use as a propellant in inhalers.\n\nUnder EPA's RMP rule, 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (KLEA 134a) is not regulated.  However, hydrogen fluoride (a raw material used in the process) and hydrochloric acid (a process by-product) are both regulated under the rule.  Flammable chemicals are not present at the INEOS Fluor facility in quantities regulated under the RMP rule.\n\nThis RMP involves predictive filing for hydrochloric acid.  The facility produces 36% nominal strength hydrochloric acid.  However, it has the capability to produce hydrochloric acid at strengths up to 38%.  Since the threshold concentration for hydrochloric acid in the RMP rule is 37% and the facility is capable of producing acid at strengths up to 38%, the predictive filing option is used for 38% hydrochloric acid.\n\nThe quantities of hydrogen fluoride and hydrochloric acid (conc. 37% or greater) provided in Section 1.17.c.3 include not only the maximum quantity found in the manufacturing process, but also the maximum quantity found in railcars located on-site.  Only a small fraction of that shown is in the manufacturing process and of that a significant fraction is in storage (i.e., the bulk of the quantities provided are in storage either in storage tanks or in railcars)"

Hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) is found only in the manufacturing process.\n\nThe INEOS Fluor facility has been recognized by the National Safety Council for its outstanding safety performance and has been awarded the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Award of Excellence for achieving zero lost workday cases among both employees and contractors.\n\nOne accident is included in the five-year accident history.  The accident, an injury to an employee from a drop of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, is required to be included because the injury was considered an OSHA recordable injury.  The employee received a small burn when a drop of hydrogen fluoride fell from a flange in the unloading area and struck him on his left shoulder.  He fully recovered and returned to work on his next scheduled workday.\n\nThe facility employs several measures to prevent a catastrophic release from occurring:\n\nDesign: design reviews; process hazard analyses; adherence to national, industry, and company design standards; experienced designers; and management of change;\n\nConstruction: positive material identification; quality assurance inspection; quality assurance testing; and pre-startup safety reviews;\n\nPreventive Maintenance: inspection and testing programs; full service maintenance programs; root cause analysis; and improvement upgrades;\n\nControl Systems: alarms; interlocks; monitoring systems; computer monitoring and control systems; and backup and fail-safe systems;\n\nTraining: rigorous employee selection process; new employee training; and periodic recertification testing;\n\nAuditing: internal audits and outside/independent evaluations.\n\nIn the event of a release, the facility has written procedures and a full emergency response plan in place, along with trained personnel to respond to the emergency.  Emergency response drills are held periodically to insure that responders are proficient in the use of mitigation systems and that notification procedures are followed.  The facility works w"

Alarms can be sounded at the facility and, if necessary, throughout the community.  The facility is a member of the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) association and the Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid System (BRAMAS) and can request assistance through these organizations.\n\nChanges to improve safety are constantly being implemented at the facility.  Employee participation programs provide employees significant opportunities for input.  Internal reviews and audits provide a means of self-check and identify areas for improvement.  Learnings from incidents and incident investigations are shared with all employees as a means of safety improvement.  Actions to prevent a recurrence of an incident are tracked to insure timely completion.  Our improvement process allows all employees to contribute to the successful operation of the facility.  The facility is constantly striving for the highest standards in safe and environmentally sound operation.\n\nThe INEOS Fluor Americas LLC St. Gabriel facility was designed and constructed with prevention of catastrophic releases as a primary goal.  In addition, facility personnel are well aware of the hazards associated with the process and work to insure that the facility is operated in a safe, environmentally sound manner.
