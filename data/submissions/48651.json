Ameren Edwards Power Station?s senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Ameren Edwards Power Station administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs include employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAmeren Edwards Power Station is located at 7800 South Cilco Lane, Bartonville, Illinois 61607.  The system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\nThe system uses 353,400 pounds of ammonia in the Selective Catalytic Reductin (SCR) system to help maintain air quality compliance of the emission stack, specifically reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions.  When in operating mode, the anhydrous ammonia system is automatically controlled based on system demand.  The anyhdrous ammonia is stored in two 30,000-gallon tanks, which are located outside facility walls.\n\nThe SCR process occurs naturally with the ammonia mixing and reacting with the flue gas.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the reducing agent.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Ameren Edwards Power Station SCR system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern th"

For example, Ameren Edwards Power Station operates in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulation.\n\nPolicies and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The ammonia system employed at the Ameren Edwards Power Station facility is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.  The monitoring system is comprised of pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor control operations.  These safety features in the SCR system include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shut down button that kills power to the SCR equipment, and relief valves on all pressure vessels.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into Ameren Edwards Power Station?s accident history showed that there had been no reportable ammonia releases over the past five years (May 2003 - May 2007) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAmeren Edwards Power Station has an Emergency Response Plan in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nAmeren Edwards Power Station maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per "

This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed on March 20, 2007, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Ameren Edwards Power Station facility located at 7800 South Cilco Lane in Bartonville, Illinois.  The Ameren Edwards Power Station safety committee has completed several items, including the recommendations, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
