Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt Nestle USA - Frozen foods Gaffney, South Carolina we handle ammonia which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that makes ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe operating procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n2.     The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of the Nestle USA - Frozen Foods Gaffney, South Carolina facility is the manufacture, packaging and distribution of frozen food products.  Ammonia is used by the facilities refrigeration system to maintain various temperature levels required by production.  Ammonia is contained within a closed refrigeration system and brought into the facility only to facilitate charging the refrigeration system when required.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at the Nestle USA - Frozen Foods Gaffney, South Carolina facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe maximum amount of ammonia that can be retained in the ammonia refrigeration system is 301,831pounds.\n\n3.     The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario  -  Failure of th"

The prevention program for program level 3 requirements are the same as OSHA PSM requirements with some terminology differences.  The format and minimum policy considerations are based on the Risk Management requirements of the latest edition of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 40, Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.
