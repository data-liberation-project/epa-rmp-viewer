Missouri\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nThe accidental release prevention policy at the Farmers Cooperative Services, Inc, involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices.  This facility conforms to the laws and regulations of the State of Missouri.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  One has a capacity of 24,000 gallons water and the other has a 12,000 gallons water capacity.  Two storage tanks, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting ands safety equipment are all part of this facility's anhydrous operation.  Though facility is manned only during spring and fall use seasons.  The facility's main office operates with normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.  The first secenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental  release of anhyrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the largest tank releasing the entire 112,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The off site consequences were calulated using TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers.  The worst-case"

      "SummaryText": "scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an F atmospheric stability class.  A rural topography was selected as typical.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a hose break and leaks 7200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended, wind speed of 3.0 metersper second with a D atmospheric stability class, was used in this scenario.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.\n\nFarmers Cooperative Services, Inc.  has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years.  Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nFarmers Cooperative Services, Inc.    has  several key elements their accident prevention plan:\n1.  The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Missouri.\n2. New personnel who handle, transfer, or transport anhydrous ammonia are trained before the use season.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid and emergency reponse.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5. Annual inspection include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n6. Use of proper anhydous ammoni personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change is operations should be made to provide increased safely to the operators and to the community."
