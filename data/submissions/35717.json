      "SummaryText": "Overview\n\nThe City of Hallandale Beach has long emphasized the importance of safety in all departments and is committed to the implementation of safety practices. This emphasis on safety also includes the handling of chemicals. Programs and policies have been established for employee safety. Many of these same policies/procedures also provide for the safety of the general public. The Risk Management Plan consolidates many of these safety procedures into one comprehensive plan. Although there are many chemicals that are used by the City to provide for City services, the Risk Management Plan is concerned with only one - chlorine.\n\n    Facility and Material Handled \n\nThe facility affected by the Risk Management Plan is the water treatment plant. The water plant is responsible for providing the City with potable drinking water. The plant treats the water in accordance with Federal and State regulatory requirements. Part of this treatment process includes disinfection. Disinfection is the most important part of the treatment process because it acts as a barrier to prevent the transmission of water borne deseases. Since 1951 the chemical used for disinfection in Hallandale has been chlorine. Chlorine is delivered to the water plant in one ton cylinders (2,000 ibs).  In the treatment process, only one cylinder is used at a time. However, as many as six cylinders (12,000 lbs) may be stored in reserve at the water plant at any one time.\n\n   Worst - Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n\nThe release scenarios were derived using RMP*COMP developed by the Cameo Team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA.\n\n\n   Accidental Release Prevention\n\nBecause of the potential consequences of an accidental release, significant care is used when handling chlorine. Some of the safety protocols include:\n- Contracting reliable chlorine distributors.\n- Establishing procedures fo"

Concurrent notification of the local Hazardous Materials Response Team would occur. The State Warning point and National Response Center would also be advised of the release. The Hallandale Fire Department, upon ariving at the release, would evaluate the release with operational staff and establish command. They would then establish hot, warm and cold zones, and evaluate/execute necessary evacuations. They would also coordinate mitigation efforts with the Haz-Mat Team. \nOffensive - The responding Haz-Mat Team is the special technical responder that pro-actively works to terminate the chemical release. Although it coordinates it's effort with the Hallandale Fire Department, it's primary goal is to stop the release. It has the necessary equipment and training to perform this task.\nRecord keeping, debriefing, and post-incident analysis would occur after termination of the release. Appropriate regulatory agencies would be advised. Information collected as part of a post-incident analysis could be used to identify areas for improvement, revising operating procedures and supplemental training.   \n\n  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTraining of employees in procedural instructions pertaining to safe operation has always been em"

Contingent upon Commission approval of the FY 2004/05 budget in August, 2004, the City of Hallandale Beach intends to convert from gas chlorination to sodiun hypochlorite for disinfection. This transition is anticipated to occur within one year. Doing so would provide improved safety for employees and residents and eliminate the need for a Risk Management Plan."
