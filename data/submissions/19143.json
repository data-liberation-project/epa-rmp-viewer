Heraeus Amersil has \nbeen in operation at this facility for 13 years, providing quality products to customers and over 200 \njobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nHeraeus Amersil is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding \ncommunity, and the environment.  It is Heraeus Amersil's policy to maintain a safe and healthy \nworkplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR \n68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety \nManagement (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal and Emergency \nResponse regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nIn order to produce the glass cylinders in a useable form for their customers, Heraeus Amersil is \nrequired to acid etch the cylinders at the facility. Heraeus Amersil purchases, stores, and uses \nHydrofluoric Acid at greater than 50 % concentration (the 112(r) regulated substance) in the acid \netching operation. The Heraeus Amersil facility stores more than the 1000 pound 112(r) regulatory \nthreshold for 50 % concentration or higher Hydrofluoric Acid and is thus subject to this regulation. \nThe Hydrofluoric Acid is used at lower concentration levels to acid etch the glass cylinders \nproduced by the facility. Heraeus Amersil's acid etching system consists of piping, valves, pumps, \nand tanks, the largest of which is 6500 gallons capacity. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68, Heraeus Amersil has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for \nHydrofluoric Acid using the par"

      "SummaryText": "ameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is \ndefined as the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel over a 10-minute period.  \nBased on Heraeus Amersil's acid etch system, Heraeus Amersil's worst case release scenario is the \nrupture of the largest single vessel (a storage tank) containing 6,500 gallons of Hydrofluoric Acid \nwhen filled to 100 % capacity, the maximum physical capacity of the tank.  Using the EPA's \nRMP*Comp program, the maximum distance to the specified \"endpoint\" (a conservative distance \nestablished by EPA at which it is expected that a person could be exposed to the chemical for an \nhour without suffering irreversible health effects) is 0.2 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered by \nHeraeus Amersil to be a likely release scenario for the facility. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic, though still unlikely, release scenario (alternative release) was developed by \nHeraeus Amersil. The scenario considered the operation's 13 year history of experience and the \nhazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted to ensure that Heraeus Amersil \nhazards are identified and minimized. The release scenario identified by Heraeus Amersil would be a \nrelease caused by overfilling of the storage tank. In developing the release parameters of this \nalternative scenario, Heraeus Amersil considered the high level alarm designed to alert operators to \na tank overfill condition, the maximum response time of the facility's operators, and the release \nmitigation provided by the building structure.  Using EPA's RMP*Comp program, the maximum \ndistance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of Hydrofluoric Acid, Heraeus Amersil has implemented \nseveral precautionary measures that include process/equipment controls, procedures, preventive-\nmaintenance programs, employ"

Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Heraeus Amersil, \nany changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nTo ensure that Heraeus Amersil's control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of \nthe Hydrofluoric Acid system, Heraeus Amersil conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every \nthree years. In accordance with the PSM program, each audit incorporates review of process safety \ninformation, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical \nintegrity, management of change, pre-startup review procedures, compliance audit procedures, \nincident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, \nand contractor safety procedures.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, Heraeus Amersil has not experienced an accidental off-site release of \nHydrofluoric Acid.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nHeraeus Amersil has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect \nboth employees and the community in the event of a release.  This program is fully described in a \ndocument entitled CONTINGENCY PLAN STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP) in \norder to facilitate response efforts in the event of a Hydrofluoric Acid release.\n\nHeraeus Amersil has trained on-site personnel to respond to accidental Hydrofluoric Acid releases.  \nThese personnel receive initial training and update training thereafter.
