      "SummaryText": "The Frankfort Wastewater Treatment Plant Risk Management Plan involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The Frankfort WWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan has been prepared for the Frankfort Utility Board for the City of FrankfortA?s Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), located at 45 West County Road 100 North in Frankfort, Clinton County, Indiana.  For report purposes, the WWTP will hereafter be referred to as Facility.\n\nThe Facility currently stores chlorine used in their process at a rate above EPA RMP  threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The facility has 13 employees.  In addition, the facility hires 2 seasonal employees during the summer months.  At least one operator is working on site 24-hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nThe chlorine gas withdrawal system (hereafter referred to as process) is used for disinfection of the plant effluent or tertiary filter influent or filtered water storage.  The process includes all chlorine storage, which occurs in the chlorine room.  The process consists of the following equipment:\n\nA?    1-ton Liquid Chlorine Containers;\nA?    Two 1-ton Container Weight Scale and Container Rack;\nA?    Overhead Hoist Equipment;\nA?    Two Vacuum Regulators;\nA?    Automatic Switchover Unit;\nA?    Two Signal Conditioning Units;\nA?    Three Injectors; and\nA?    Process Piping.\n\nChlorine dosage relative to flow is controlled by the signal conditioning units and injectors.  Each proportioner is controlled by a signal from the flow metering equipment at the effluent end of the chlorine contact chamber.  Water flowing across the injector creates a partial vacu"

The normal point of chlorine application will be at the chlorine contact tank.\n\nPlant effluent chlorination is required on a continuous basis with the chlorine residual not to exceed 1.0 milligrams per liter (mg/L) at the point of discharge.   Chlorine application at the tertiary filter influent or the filtered water storage tank, used to control bacterial activity, may be accomplished independent of the effluent chlorination.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as A?worst caseA? and A?alternative releases.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Frankfort Wastewater Treatment Plant involves a failure of the containment system and release of 2,500 pounds of chlorine.  The offsite consequence analysis performed involved one condition as specified by the EPA.  This condition allows for the release of the entire amount of chlorine gas in a period of 10 minutes.  \n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5m/sec, highest daily standard temperature (70&#61616;F), and average humidity (65%) were used as well as consideration for an enclosure situation.\n\nWhen using the EPAA?s RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables or equations for the worst case scenario, a distance to toxic endpoint of 2.6 miles and an estimate residential population potentially affected of 17,629.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the sheering of the steel connections (transfer hose failure) connected to the two one-ton container, possibly due to human error.  The amount of chlorine released is 2,500 lb, at an average rate over 2 hours (the duration of the release) of 21 lb/min.  The estimated distance traveled to the toxic endpoint is 1 mile with affected residential population of 4,948.\n\nThe Frankfort Wast"

Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\nA?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures\n\nA?    Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\nA?    Implementation of a hazard review and inspection program\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, ventilation and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated by the Clinton County Volunteer Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Commission.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\nSeveral changes to improve safety were identified when the Risk Management Prevention Program was updated in 2009 for this facility.  These recommended actions will be implemented.\n"
