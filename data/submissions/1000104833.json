The procedure assures that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  \n\nPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\nHuntsman Conroe Plant performs Pre-Startup Safety Reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; Management-of-Change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n\nCompliance Audit\nHuntsman Conroe Plant performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its process safety management program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\nIncident Investigation\nHuntsman Conroe Plant investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman Conroe Plant establi"

The Conroe Site assigns employees to the HAZOP teams who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific processes.  The HAZOP teams develop recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. The Huntsman Conroe Plant completes a PHA Revalidation for each covered process every 5-years (or less) meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards. \n\nOperating Procedures\nHuntsman Conroe Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and/or revised annually to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\nTraining\nHuntsman Conroe Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasis safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHuntsman Conroe Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nHuntsman Conroe Plant has established and implemented a written procedure to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures,"

      "SummaryText": "HUNTSMAN CONROE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nNotes regarding the 2023 resubmission: Propylene Oxide received in railcars.\n \n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies - Huntsman Conroe Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally responsible work place for its employees and neighbors.  The Huntsman Conroe Site maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program that implements a series of steps to control potential hazards associated with the processes and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with on-site procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Conroe Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety.  Huntsman has participated in the past with the Responsible Care initiative, is committed to the responsible management of chemicals, and is an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001-2015 quality management program.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances - Huntsman's Conroe Site is located approximately five miles east of Conroe, Texas.  The Site is 476 acres, of which 100 acres have been developed.  The Conroe Site takes raw materials and uses batch or continuous operations to produce useful chemicals which other companies then process into cosmetics, epoxy coatings and other consumer products.  Huntsman's Conroe Site has 9 regulated substances at the facility.\t\n\nFour flammable substances are:\nDimethylamine (DMA) - Used in hair products, gasoline additives, as antistatic agents, fabric softeners and dyes.\nHydrogen - Used to produce fuel additives and epoxy curing agents.\nMonomethylamine (MMA) - Used in gas treating of refinery and natural gas streams and as a textile softener.\nTrimethylamine - Used in products for the electronics industries for chip manufacturing and"
