Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules, regulations, and requirements.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these products combined with the safety devices, policies, and procedures in the operation of the process. These include aggressive safety programs such as our Basic Safety Process and our Responsible Care Codes of Mangement Practice.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance:\n\nThe applicable stationary source and regulated substance in the processing of Arsine. This is manufactured under vacuum using a chemical reaction to generate the gas. The aggregate storage of this product makes RMP applicable. There are no processes at this facility at or above the TQ for arsine.\n\n3. The Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Case Scenarios, including adminstrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe worst case includes a release of approximately 130 pounds over the required 10 minutes with an off site toxic endpoint.\n\nThe alternate release includes a 2.2 pound release with over 10 minutes with a required off site toxic endpoint.\n\n4. The general accident release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation. In addition, the facility implements the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care codes of managment practice and complies with all local and state specific regulatory requirements.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:\n\nOn July 11 2001, a loss of containment occurred with an in-process arsine cylinder in which emergency services responded. There were no confirmed injuries but there were dozens that were evaluated.\n\n6. The emergency response program:"
