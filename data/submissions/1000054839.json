The flammable material is composed of a mixture that contains the following regulated substances: ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. It is assumed that the mixture is composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage (i.e. the predominant regulated flammable component of the mixture) in this case this substance is pentane.\r\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved an uncontrolled release of 763,407 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.7 miles to the 1 psi endpoint, wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, stability class F with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).   \r\n\r\nb.\tAlternative case scenarios:\r\nTwo alternative scenarios were evaluated.  One scenario was a 3 inch leak from the second largest amount of flammable mixture (Condensate Surge Tank V-403) resulting in vapor cloud fire. The second scenario was done to identify a case closest to a public receptor.  This case evaluated a 4 inch leak from the Stabilized Condensate tanks (TK-452) resulting in a vapor cloud fire. \r\nThe alternative scenarios were calculated using the chemical with the lowest lower flammability limit (LFL).  The LFL for butane, ethane and propane is 36 mg/L, and pentane has a LFL of 38"

The Grady Plant has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. \r\nNo regulated toxic chemicals (listed in 40 CFR \u00a768.130) is handled at the Grady Plant.

The Grady Plant Emergency Action Plan (EAP) defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The EAP includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken to ensure local emergency responders are informed of the event.
