      "SummaryText": "Arkema Inc. owns and operates a chemical manufacturing facility located at 355 Hwy 3142, Hahnville, LA 70057.  This facility is part of the Arkema Coating Resins (ACR) Business Unit within Arkema Inc., and is commonly referred to as 'SCO Latex'.  Operations at SCO Latex produce water based latex emulsion products that are primarily used in coating, sealing and adhesive applications.  \n\n\n\nSCO Latex strives for excellence in safety and environmental compliance.  The SCO Latex facility has a full range of policies and procedures that control the operating discipline in the handling and transfer of chemicals.  All chemicals are handled with care of the environment and the persons handling them.  As a function of latex emulsion production, the RMP regulated substances handled in the facility are acrylonitrile, ammonia and vinyl acetate monomer.\n\nAs part of the ongoing commitment to safety and environmental compliance, the ACR SCO Latex facility stays abreast of OSHA PSM regulations as part of the site's HSE Compliance program.  A multi-level spill prevention program remains in force in the facility that includes policies and procedures, operating discipline, auditing, incident reporting and safety level switches.  In the past five years the ACR SCO Latex facility has had no (0) release incidents related to the RMP regulated chemicals.  \n\n\n\nAs part of an ongoing emergency response system, the ACR SCO Latex maintains a series of documented emergency response procedures, conducts employee emergency response training and conducts emergency response drills.  In addition to policies and training, the site also works closely with the local emergency response organizations and the local emergency planning committee.  Through our ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP program, ACR SCO Latex looks continuously for possible chemical handling system changes to improve safety in our facility.\n\n\n\n"
