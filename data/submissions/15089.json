Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and emloyees of UAP Northwest's facility at 379 E. 300 S., Jerome Idaho are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of aqueous ammonia (20% concentration).  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Jerome facility is the storage, and sale of liquid fertilizers and micronutirents to our customers.\n\nThe regulated substance, aqueous ammonia will be received, stored and used in a liquid micro-nutrient fertilizer process.  This facility has decided not to take advantage of engineering controls to minimize the percentage, or quantity of aqueous ammonia when the shipment arrives.\n\nAqueous ammonia will be stored at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqueos ammonia stored at Jerome is 49,000 pounds.\n\n3.     The Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario.       Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 49,000 pounds of aqueous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at capacity.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.20 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario.       The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from the storage vessel.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.10 miles.\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAqueous Ammonia:    The facility has implemented an annual inspection program which includes a visual inspection and third party ultra-sound thickness testing of the tank wall to Steel Tank"

      "SummaryText": "Manufacturer's specifications.\n\n5.     Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of Anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nhave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.     The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written Emergency Contingency plan (C-Plan).  The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under; OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38,1910.119 and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264, subpart D, and part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA - FRP - 40 CFR part 194.  Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and Community Right-To-Know, pre emergency planning and emergency response information.\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia storage or processes at the facility."
