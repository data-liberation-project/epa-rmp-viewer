Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care ?.\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility has 3 processes that involve regulated substances.\n\nThe Methylated Resins process makes products that are raw materials for the manufacture of coatings for the automotive and other industries; and, adhesives for rubber tire manufacturing.  The regulated substance involved with this process is formaldehyde.\n\nThe Polyamines process makes products that are used to manufacture water treatment chemicals for the paper, mining and food processing industry.  The regulated substances involved with this process are epichlorohydrin and a flammable mixture of dimethylamine in water.\n\nThe Quaternized PAM Emulsions process makes products that are used to separate sludge and solids from water in water recovery facilities before the water is returned to rivers and lakes.  The regulated substances involved with this process are methyl chloride, formaldehyde, and a flammable mixture of dimethylamine in water. \n\n(c) WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of a storage tank and the release of 220,000 pounds of methyl chloride.  The effect of written operating procedures and a high level alarm that prevents the storage tank from being filled to more than 91% of its capacity was included in the evaluation of the possible con"

The evaporating methyl chloride could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe flammables worst-case scenario is the failure of a storage tank and the release of 170,000 pounds of a flammable mixture (60% aqueous dimethylamine).  The effect of written operating procedures and a high level alarm that prevents the storage tank from being filled to more than 93% of its capacity was included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The overpressure from the ignition of the vapor could reach off-site endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for epichlorohydrin is a leak in a transfer line during unloading and a release of 160,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a dike and a sump were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences. The evaporating epichlorohydrin could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n \nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde is a leak in a storage tank recirculating line and the release of 38,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a dike and a sump were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The evaporating formaldehyde could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for methyl chloride is a leak in a transfer pipe and the release of 15,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effect of an excess flow valve was included in the evaluation of the possible consequences. The evaporating methyl chloride could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the flammable mixture (60% aqueous dimethylamine) is a leak in the transfer pipe from the storage tank and the release of 46,000 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of operating procedures, a high level alarm and a high level switch that prevents filling the tank to more than 93% of its capacity were included in evaluating the possible consequences.

In the event of an emergency requiring assistance from outside agencies, our personnel will make the necessary notifications and will be able to interact effectively with outside emergency response personnel, since we are trained to operate under the same system.  Working with Cytec Kalamazoo facility Emergency Preparedness Team leaders, the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety (KDPS) and the Kalamazoo County Office of Emergency Management would make any decisions concerning how best to protect the neighboring community.  \n\nIn the event of a release of one of the four regulated substances, or other hazardous material, our facility Emergency Preparedness Team would use chemical-specific response plans and procedures to address the emergency at the earliest stage possible so as to prevent escalation of the incident.\n\nWe regularly participate in the activities of the Kalamazoo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Disaster Planning Committee.  We work with the KDPS, which provides all fire-fighting services within the jurisdiction that includes this facility, to conduct facility tours for any personnel who may one day have to respond, required facility inspections, and training exercises.\n\nContracted professional technicians test our fire protection system, which includes signals, alarms and sprinkler protection of all processing areas, on a monthly basis.  Similarly, contract service technicians perform monthly inspections and service on our respiratory protection equipment, and annual inspections on all fire extinguishers.\n\nFacility personnel test our two fire pumps weekly, and safety showers and eyewash stations are checked monthly.  \n\nFacility personnel who are members of the Emergency Preparedness Team are provided training on emergency response procedures and use of protective and response equipment, and participate in training ex"
