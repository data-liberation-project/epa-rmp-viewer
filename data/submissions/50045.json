This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant located in Bexar County County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Hydrocarbons LP. And is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant is a gas liquid extraction plant consisting of a single train cryogenic turboexpander process with three turboexpander units.      Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The plant processes the gas utilizing the installed turbo expander plant to remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the inlet gas stream.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\n\nListed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the San Martin Gas Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, iso-pentane and pentane.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administratio"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the San Martin Gas Plant.  The San Martin Gas Plant is subject to the OSHA PSM standard, and to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the OSHA PSM accident prevention program and EPA Program 3 Safety Management Program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant\u00bfs PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a \u00bfnear-miss\u00bf reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate exis"

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes a"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the San Martin Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.

Over the past five years there have been no hazardous material release incidents with onsite or offsite deaths, injuries or  property damage.    \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.  The San Martin Gas Plant also conducts periodic on-site emergency training to insure that location employees know how to respond in case of an emergency.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the San Martin Gas Plant is coordinated with the Bexar County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry rep"

The San Martin Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Sandy Oaks Volunteer Fire Department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In most cases, due to the limited resources of the local volunteer fire department, local emergency response is expected to be limited to access and traffic control, and emergency medical treatment and evacuation, if necessary.  \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The facility also solicits recommendations from the location technicians regarding the installation of new equipment to improve either plant operating safety or emergency response.  At the present time, several projects are planned for installation that are designed to improve the safety of San Martin Plant.\n\n\u00bf\tA programmable logic controller (PLC) based control system is planned to improve control of the location residue gas turbine compressors\n\u00bf\tA complere PLC-based ontrol system is being planned for installation to improve the control of the cryogenic gas processing plant, and to insure the ready availability of spare parts\n\u00bf\tA new level control valve more suitable for the application is being planned for installation on the cold separator vessel in the cryogenic gas processing plant."

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new pr"

Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the San Martin Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe San Martin Gas Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific saf"
