      "SummaryText": "Taylor Farms operates a fresh salad processing and shipping facility in Yuma, AZ. in addition to other similar facilities. Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at all Taylor Farms facilities. The same management personnel at each facility are responsible for maintaining the ammonia refrigeration equipment to prevent accidents, and for responding to emergencies. The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nThe Taylor Farms facility is located at 10241-E South Avenue 4E in Yuma, Arizona. This facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their cold rooms, vacuum cooling, and process water chilling operations. Fresh produce is brought from the fields and cooled to remove field heat. The produce is then stored in the cold storage warehouse, or processed as value-added. \n\nThere are both portable and fixed refrigeration systems onsite and all have safeties to detect unsafe operating conditions. Fixed and portable equipment support the cold storage rooms, processing facility, and vacuum pre-cooling equipment. The portable equipment is located outdoors, and has no detection system. Fixed equipment is located within the facility and includes the fan coil units and piping. Operators monitor the system when it is operating.  The fixed refrigeration system configuration includes high pressure receivers, suction accumulators, low pressure recirculators, pumper drums, fan coils (room evaporators), evaporative condensers, and piping systems. The portable refrigeration equipment includes skid mounted compressors, water chillers, vacuum tube trailers, and vacuum tube high side trailers. Each vacuum tube high side trailer has two refrigeration compressors, an evaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver, and, in some cases, a low pressure recirculator.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membr"

      "SummaryText": "anes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may cause suffocation, as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious skin burn. \n\nThe purpose of this RMP is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards, to identify hazards associated with the use of Anhydrous Ammonia, and to provide procedures to minimize the risks involved with handling this material.\n\nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aide response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractor would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Taylor Farms personnel are limited to the following emergency response (1) monitoring, (2) limited initial response which includes emergency equipment shutdown, (3) system isolation, (4) facility evacuation, and (5) emergency notification. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel. The refrigeration contractor will provide any controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. \n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years"
