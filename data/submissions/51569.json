Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Corsicana Technolgies, Inc.,Corsicana Plant, has always had a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe working envrionment. This policy is consistent with both the spirit and the intent of our commitment.  The safety of employees, company operations, and the public are mangement's most important complete compliance with all safety regulations and safety policies.\n\nEvery attempt will be made to reduce the possibility of accident occurrence by all levels of mangement.  Corsicana belives that safety, like quality and housekeeping, can be controlled by motivated supervision.  Therefore, preventable lost time accidents will have an impact on a supervisor's annual salary review, including any bonuses and incentive plans.  Unreported accidents will be considered falsification of company records and will result in immediate discharge.  Lost time accident free locations will be eligible for annual awards.\n\n2.  The Station Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nCorsicana operates a specialty chemcial plant, and manufacturers fatty amines and nitrile intermediates.  The principal prducts are emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, de-emulsifiers, and surfactants.\n\nWe have seven regulated substances present at our facility as raw materials for processes, which include dimethylamine (DMA), acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen, formaldehyde, methyl chloride (MeCl), and trimethylamine (TMA).  Acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, and methyl chloride are regulated as toxic chemicals and trimethylamine, hydrogen, and dimethylamine ar regulated as flammable chemicals.\n\n \n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations Par"

A number of processes at our faciity are subject to the Occupatonal Safety and Health Adminstrtioan (OSHA) Processes Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following section briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCorsicana maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of the information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. Corsicana primarily uses the checklist and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nFor the purposes of safety conducting activiites within our covered processes, Corsicana maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency oeprations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nCorsicana develops and impl"

These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining\nCorsicana has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processses are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initital training of operators is provided, and refresher training is provided as required.  Both initial and refresher training is documented and records of training are maintained onsite for at least 3 years.\n\nMechanical Itegrity\nCorsicana has written procedures for maintaining on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficieinces and the application of quality assurance measures.  Corsicana carries out documetned maintenaince checks on process equipment to ensure proper installation and operaitons.  Process equipment examined by these checks incldueds among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, control and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualifeid and trained pesonnel.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that euqipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they wll be used.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Corsicana to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCorsicana coddcucts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and are conducted at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are documented in a report.
