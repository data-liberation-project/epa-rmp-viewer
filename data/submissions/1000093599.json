Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at the Grimmway Enterprises, Inc. Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  It is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass vegetable cold storage.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  Substance one is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant. \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 20,633 lbs.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \n\n\n\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPAs OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPAs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.\n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Infor"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.   \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conduction activities within our covered processes, the Grimmway/David Road Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  \n\n\n\nTraining: \n\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks of process equipment to ensue proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  The timing of their inspections follow the recommended guidelines available form the manufacturer and the International of Ammonia Refrigeration.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identifies by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\n\n\nManageme"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly make aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Grimmway/David Road Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading into the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nThe Grimmway/David Road Facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information from process hazard analyses in particular. \n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nOn the occasion our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
