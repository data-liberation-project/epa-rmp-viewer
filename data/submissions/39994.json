      "SummaryText": "Taylor/Excel produces beef products at our plant in Wyalusing. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner and the facility has been recognized as an OSHA Star site in the VPP Program.\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility as the refrigerant, similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system. Ammonia is used to keep air temperatures in our process areas, coolers, and freezers in specified ranges. These temperatures are required to assure food safety. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\nA. Describe the Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies.\n\nTaylor/Excel takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Safety/Security Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates two refrigeration systems with an ammonia inventory of approximately 52,000 and 11,480 pounds respectively. Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Wyalusing plant.\n\nC. Summary of worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n No Longer Required.\n\nD. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies wit"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no ammonia related accidents at the Wyalusing plant in the past five years.\n\nF. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Wyalusing plant. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe plant response team utilizes employees who are trained to enter and stop an accidental ammonia release.\n\nG. Planned Changes to improve Safety\n\nTaylor/Excel is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration systems in a safe and responsible manner. We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective. Recent mprovements include raising the height of the relief vents on the roof to 15 feet above working surfaces.\n\nIn an effort to improve the safety of our employees and the surrounding community we have removed the one ton cylinders of chlorine from our site and replaced this process with a less hazardous chemical. All Chlorine Gas cylinders were removed from site effective 6-1-03."
