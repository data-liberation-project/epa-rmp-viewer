Process operators, maintenance personnel, or other employees whose tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to address the modifications. \n\n10.\tPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\nMGC has a Pre-startup Safety Review program for the Covered Process. The facility performs Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications of the Covered Process. The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. A completed PSSR is required prior to introducing hazardous materials to the process.\n\n11.\tCompliance Audits\nMGC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being implemented. The last compliance audit for the facility was completed in April 2021.\n\n12.\tIncident Investigation\nMGC investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. Incident Investigation reports related to the Covered Process are retained for a minimum of five years. \n\n13.\tEmployee Participation \nMGC has developed a written employee participation plan.
