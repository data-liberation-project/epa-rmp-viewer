The facility policy is to adhere, at a minimum, to the applicable Federal and state rules and regulations that govern accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n?    The facility handles liquid sulfur dioxide, and anhydrous ammonia. The facility has a process safety program and reviews its processes on a regular basis utilizing the HAZOP (Hazards and Operability Study) method to review any potential hazards.\n\n?    The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of one ?worst case release? scenario, of sulfur dioxide, and ?alternative release scenario? for sulfur dioxide, and anhydrous ammonia. \n\n?    A strong emphasis is placed on worker safety and accident prevention.  Conscientious efforts by trained personnel ensure that the facility operates within the guidelines established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (O"

The facility has not had any reportable accidents from covered processes in the past 5-years.  \n\n?    An emergency response plan for the facility has been prepared and provided to emergency responders, including Monroe County LEPC (local emergency planning committee), local Fire companies, and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.  The facility was recognized in 1996 by the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) with the presentation of the ?Partnership Award?.  The award recognizes extraordinary contributions to chemical emergency preparedness and prevention programs.\n\n?    Consideration is underway to change from the bulk storage of sulfur dioxide to significantly smaller cylinder volumes.  If suitable, such a change would remove this chemical from the program as the quantity on site would be less than the threshold planning quantity.\n \n\n?    Worst case accident scenario: The worst-case scenario is the potential failure of a storage tank containing 25,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide.  In this scenario, sulfur dioxide would be released onto the ground and evaporating sulfur dioxide could potentially reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n?    The alternative accident scenarios:  Alternative scenarios for sulfur dioxide and ammonia were selected using the following criteria:\n?    Reviewing documented facility incident history;\n?    Reviewing documented Process Hazards Analysis;\n?    Reviewing published estimated failure rates of equipment; and,\n?    Reviewing mitigation devices.\n\nAfter reviewing the data, it was decided that the facility would use one alternative accident scenario for each covered chemical. Listed below are the two chemicals and their alternative accident scenarios.\n\nSulfur dioxide alternative accident scenario: This scenario begins with a 1 inch hole in the liquid line (similar to"

The sulfur dioxide would be released into a containment area that would contain the release.  Evaporating sulfur dioxide could potentially reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAmmonia alternative accident Scenario:  This scenario begins with a 1 inch hole in the liquid line (similar to an open valve) transferring ammonia from the storage vessel to the mixing tank.  The ammonia would be released into the atmosphere and evaporating ammonia could potentially reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nThe following administrative controls and mitigation measures are used to protect employees, and limit the distances to the toxic endpoint:\n?    Written Operating Procedures, with one and or two operator sign-off for steps.\n?    Two Operators perform and monitor critical steps during the manufacture of the products.\n?    Extensive Operator training concerning the hazards of the process, and steps needed to correct process deviations.\n?    Automatic shutdown system\n?    Equipment and process have been designed considering industry standards, and good engineering practices.\n?    Procedures developed to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n?    Pressure relief/vent headers are closed and vented to a scrubber system designed to mitigate any potential release of hazardous materials.\n?    Computer controlled product delivery systems.\n?    Containment areas and systems to contain potential releases that might occur.\n?    Emergency isolation valves, and emergency shutdown system.\n?    Fixed-point monitors used to provide early detection for leaks of hazardous materials.\n?

All necessary personnel, including outside contractors are made aware of the applicable change before they become involved with the affected operation, or before procedural changes become effective.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE & PLANNING ? 68.95\nThe facility has addressed emergency response through various regulatory requirements.  The following plans are in place to address emergency planning and response requirements:\n?    Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Plan, which was based upon the requirements of the Monroe County Local Emergency Planning Committee;\n?    Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency/Spill Prevention Response (PPC/SPR) Plan; the PPC/SPR plan is required under the Pennsylvania Storage Tank Law because of the use of on site fuel oil; and,\n?    The PPC/SPR plan addresses facility response to both on site fuels and highly hazardous chemicals (HHC).  It addresses requirements specified under the following regulations as required under OSHA 1910.119(n):\n?    OSHA 1910.120(q)   Emergency Response to Hazardous Substance Releases;\n?    OSHA 1910."

The PPC/SPR plan is the primary plan used during emergency situations.  In general, the emergency response plan which covers the entire facility has the following important elements:\n?    There is an on site trained Emergency Response Team; all emergency response responsibilities are assigned.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS ? 68.79\nThe Safety Department is responsible for ensuring that audits are performed as scheduled and findings are documented in a report.  The audit team is responsible for determining corrective measures, which are reviewed and approved by the Management Team.  The Safety Department is responsible for ensuring that the corrective measures are implemented.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION ? 68.81\nThe facility has an incident investigation program.  The management elements of the program include the following:\n?    Incidents are defined as any event that is not considered part of normal operations and involves spills, releases, fires, near miss, and/or explosions and that include reviews of the emergency response actions.  An incident by definition also includes situations where a serious outcome could have occurred but did not occur.\n?    Employees are encouraged to notify the Shift Supervisor or the Safety Department of near miss incidents without fear of disciplinary action. \n?    Incident investigations are formally and promptly initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  \n?    Each incident is a learning experience which may require changes in facilities, Manufacturing Instructions, process safety information, training, emergency response procedures, maintenance, and other activities identified as a result of the incident investigation.\n?    All incident investigation reports require a means of preventing future occurrence and a written follow up implementation plan, as necessary.\n?    All incident investigation reports are disseminated "

The team may have involvement with the development and maintenance of all process safety management programs, as well as other active teams (i.e., PHA teams).  Process safety information is available to all employees and is located in the PHA manuals for all covered processes.  These manuals are located in the Manufacturing Conference Room.  \n \nGeneral Duty Review\nPurpose:\nThis program is designed to address those elements of the Accidental Release provisions of the Clean Air Act, Risk Management Program Provisions, as they apply to General Duty provisions.  These are situations where chemicals are not listed under the EPA?s CAAA Risk Management Program, but may pose some potential risk to the community.\n\nScope:\nAfter completing a Risk Management Program for those chemicals that are above regulatory threshold planning quantity at the facility, the following chemicals have been identified as those that may pose some potential risk to the community, but are not severe enough to require completion of a Risk Management Plan as outlined in the CAAA:\n?    Octene\n?    Methanol\n\nProgram:\nThe program is to classify each chemical listed by the EPA Risk Management Program, OSHA Process Safety Management Program, SARA Title III Emergency Plan, or for some other reason.  The general use and handling of each chemical is then explained including applicable containment and release mitigation measures.  Finally the impacts of releases are assessed using EPA approved modeling techniques.\n\nPrograms by Chemical:\n\nOctene\nOctene is used in the production of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals.  Octene is not listed on the EPA?s RMP program, but it is covered under OSHA?s PSM program as a generic flammable"
