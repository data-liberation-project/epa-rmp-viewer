The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Bossier City Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of the Bossier City Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Bossier City Water Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of Bossier City, Louisiana, a city with a population of over 55,000 residents.  The Bossier City Water Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the threshold quantity - chlorine and ammonia.  \n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires the Bossier City Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  The Bossier City Water Treatment Plant conducted a Hazard Assessment for the Chlorination and Ammoniation Processes. The results of the Hazard Assessment have been formally communicated with the local emergency response agencies. \n\n\n\n\n\n4.0    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires that a prevention program be established for the Bossier City Water Treatment Plant chlorination and ammoniation processes.
