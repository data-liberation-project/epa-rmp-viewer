S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  We also handle propane, which the EPA considers a hazardous flammable gas.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia and propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat  to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia and propane, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nWe at Hawkinsville Fertilizer, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our  facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Pulaski Emergency Management which  provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nHawkinsville Fertilizer, Inc. sales anhydrous ammonia to area farmers as a source of nitrogen.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility via transport and is stored in above-ground storage tanks at the facility prior to sale.\n\n\n\nThe regulated toxic substance handled at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum quantity o"

The maximum quantity of propane that can be stored at the facility is 130,000 pounds in two 18,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario for toxic substances as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  For toxic gases, the entire contents of the tank are assumed to be released as a gas over a ten-minute period.  For toxic liquids, the entire contents of the tank are assumed to spill instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The rat of release to air is determined from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool.  Passive mitigation measures (e.g. enclosures, dikes) may be taken into account.  The toxic endpoint is the threshold for serious injury from exposure to a toxic substance in the air.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  In reality, a vapor release would not occur, some quantity of anhydrous ammonia would remain in liquid form.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp, the EPA recommended software.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L (200 PPM).  Based on 100,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 3.2-miles from the location of the storage tank.\n\n\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario for flammable subst"

The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\n\n\nThis worst-case scenario as defined by the EPA is also highly unlikely to occur.  During the  evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.\n\n\n\nHawkinsville Fertilizer, Inc. has incorporated a facility policy that limits the maximum filling capacity of all propane storage tanks to 88% at 60oF.  Therefore, our worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 67,000 pounds of propane from a 18,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n\n\nBased on 67,000 pounds of propane released, RMP*Comp calculated the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.2-mile from the location of the storage tank.\n\n\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia deemed most likely to occur at the facility is the failure of a flexible liquid transfer hose while transferring anhydrous ammonia from a transport to the storage tank.  The 3-inch flexible transfer hose is connected to iron piping.  Excess flow valves at the storage tanks and transport function to stop the flow of anhydrous ammonia out of the storage tank and transport.  Therefore, the anhydrous ammonia released would be limited to 555 pounds, the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the transfer hose and iron piping between the transport and the storage tanks.\n\n\n\nT"

The transfer hose connects to iron piping.  Excess flow valves at the storage tanks and truck transport function to stop the flow of propane out of the storage tank and truck transport.  Therefore, the propane released would be limited to 150 pounds of propane, the amount in the transfer hose and iron piping.\n\n\n\nIn this alternative release scenario, the entire contents of the transfer hose and piping would be released before facility personnel could implement actions to stop the release.  RMP*Comp estimates the distance endpoint for the release of 150 pounds of propane to no longer pose a hazard to the public as 0.03-mile.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nHawkinsville Fertilizer, Inc. complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
