Further, it is our intention to use guidelines established by OSHA, EPA, and other available sources, to help provide a safe work place.  The facility will comply fully with both the letter and the spirit of all applicable regulatory compliance requirements.\nThis adherence to safety is integrated into our philosophy and code of ethics.  This philosophy is based on several ideals.  We seek to provide a safe and healthy environment for our employees, for the prevention of illness, injury, or death to anyone due to factors under our control.  Protecting the environment is a high priority for our company. We are pledged to reduce and hope to eliminate our use of toxic substances whenever possible.  When it is not possible to avoid the wastes produced, we are committed to minimize the quantities generated by staying within the bounds of the environmental laws that reduce undesirable effects on air, water, and land.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\nConrad Forest Products pressure treats lumber and plywood with wood preservatives to significantly increase their useful life by protecting them against termite attack and decay caused by fungi and microorganisms-and we do this without impairing the natural characteristics of the wood.  The preservatives to be used at this plant site are Copper Azole (CA-C) and Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (DOT).  The elements in CA-C and DOT are important to the overall performance of the preservatives.  After start up, this facility eliminated the Copper Boron Azole (CBA) and is using Copper Azole (CA-C) formula.  This new formula is similar to the CBA with the exception that the boron and diethanolamine were removed.  \nWhen pressure impregnated into the wood, the CA-C, or DOT, and its elements become fixed to the cellulose of the wood cells and form insoluble precipitates.

Unlike wood that has merely been coated with paint or stain, pressure treating solution penetrates deep into the wood structure offering a lifetime warranty for the product.  FIFRA (i.e., EPA's pesticide regulations) classifies CA-C and DOT as non-restricted use pesticides and does not require California's Prop 65 labeling.\nThe primary wood species is incised by passing the wood through a machine equipped with cutting teeth projecting from rollers.  As the wood passes through the machine, the teeth are pressed into the wood to form a predetermined pattern of incisions that penetrate to a specified depth, usually dependent upon the pattern and density of the teeth.  The incising provides a continuous envelope of treatment by allowing the preservative to penetrate the cell structures of the wood.  The timber, lumber, and plywood to be treated are loaded onto small rail or tramcars.  Using a vehicle, such as a forklift or winch, the trams are moved into a large horizontal treating cylinder.  The cylinder door is sealed, and a vacuum is applied generally after conditioning.\nA vacuum is applied to remove most of the air from the cylinder and the wood cells.  Preservative solution is then pumped into the cylinder and pressure raised to about 150 pounds per square inch, forcing the preservative into the wood.  The total time will vary, depending on the species of wood, commodity being treated, and the amount of preservative to be impregnated but, in all instances, the treating process is a closed system.  At the end of the process, excess treating solution is pumped out of the cylinder and back to a work tank for reuse.  The cylinder door is opened and the trams pulled out.  The wood is wet at that time, so it is kept on a covered pad, which meets 40 CFR 265.440 Subpart W drip pad requirements.  Any drips trickle onto the pad containment area, then drain to a "

The process of pressure treating wood with CA-C and DOT preservative is regulated throughout North America by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as well as state authorities, and the Code of Good Practice.\nThe facility stores and uses only one regulated chemical, in sufficient quantity, to be required to comply with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  This material is aqua ammonia at 29% concentration.  The aqua ammonia is added to the CA-C treating solution (with up to 1.3% aqua ammonia in the solution) to enhance penetration of the wood preservative in the lumber.  The regulated system and equipment, under the CalARP, will include the storage tank for the aqua ammonia concentrate, the associated piping into and out of that tank that carry the aqua ammonia, and all tanks and piping with at least 1% concentration of aqua ammonia.  There is a water scrubber system to treat the fugitive emissions of ammonia vapor released in the process and associated tanks.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nEmployees are provided with ongoing training to make sure they understand how to work safely.  Everyone at the plant knows the spill prevention and emergency plans.  These plans, as well as the nature of the materials handled, are shared with the local fire department and emergency response personnel.  Our treating processes and our work practices ensure the health and safety of our employees and the community in a number of ways.\nOur wood treating process is accomplished in a closed system. When the concentrate arrives for CA-C it arrives in a special tanker at our treating plant, it is unloaded directly into a concentrate receiving tank.  No one comes in contact with the solution.  The DOT comes in 50 lb. bags and is stored in the treatment facility.  The borate powder is poured into a mix tank and water is added.  The concentrates ar"

Wood is loaded onto small cars, which are pushed into the treating cylinder.  There, in a sealed and locked cylinder with vacuum and pressure developed under precisely controlled conditions, the wood is injected with the diluted solutions of CA-C or DOT.\nWhen the wood is removed from the treating cylinder, no fumes or vapors are released to the environment except very small amounts of ammonia and some organic vapors from the conditioning process.  All areas are monitored to comply with PEL monitoring requirements for the EPA.  The treated wood comes out of the cylinder with approximately 85% of the preservative locked in the cell walls when treated with CA-C.  DOT being a diffusion process stays in the wood after it dries; but will migrate out of the wood when saturated with moisture.  While the wood cures, it remains on the drip pad, which is designed to collect excess preservative for reuse.  Within a few days, all the treated wood is dry and moved to storage or loaded for delivery.\nThe drip pad is made of impervious material including high strength reinforced concrete, using special water tight construction joints per 40 CFR Part 265.440 Subpart W.  The drip pad had an external liner and detection system installed.\nThe operation is a zero discharge plant with regards to process water.  The portion of the plant where the liquid preservative is handled is totally contained through the use of concrete diking around our tanks and treatment cylinders.  The floors of these areas are also impermeable and sloped toward collection points where liquids are sumped and piped to work tanks for reuse.

Facility operators will be trained concerning the hazards, handling and cleanup of aqua ammonia.  Priority will be given for immediate maintenance repair on any leaks or equipment damage.  When cylinders are cleaned, loaded or unloaded, or when freshly-treated wood is handled, employees wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

The containment area is of sufficient size, heavy mobile equipment is prevented entry into the chemical storage areas, gasket locations are limited since most of the piping is welded, and chemical piping is located within the contained area.\nThe fourth level of protection is that employees daily perform a visual check as well as monthly inspections of all tanks and piping.  These equipment inspections, and security, help prevent, as well as minimize, a release incident.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\nSafety improvements are continually looked at.  The design of this facility tried to incorporate safety features such as the inaccessibility of tanks and pipes to mobile equipment, diking, a leak detection and collection system, along with security to prevent any incidents from happening.  Employee training is completed using outside resources, such as our aqua ammonia vendor, to ensure they have the knowledge to recognize a potential unsafe act or hazard."
