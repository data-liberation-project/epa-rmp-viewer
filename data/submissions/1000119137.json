This RMP document describes Anhydrous Ammonia storage at Specialty Ag Formulations, LLC (hereafter referred to as SAF) facility located at 1658 Mission Avenue Aurora, NE 68818 figure 1. A site vicinity map is included as Figure 2. The RMP program has three program levels that could apply. This facility does not qualify for Program 1 since the distance to a toxic endpoint for a worse-case release is more than the distance to any public receptor. The facility also does not meet the requirements for Program Level 2.  Due to process quantity and impact to receptors the facility process meets the requirements listed in 2735.4 (e) as a RMP Program Level 3, which includes process safety management standards. \nA.\tThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source. SAF is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates and is prepared to prioritize operating safely and environmentally sound. SAF will ensure that adequate training is provided to employees to minimize the accidental release of materials that are deemed hazardous. \nB.\tA Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n1.\tDescription of the Stationary Source Brandt produces agricultural fertilizers'. SAF currently uses 99% Anhydrous Ammonia to prepare fertilizer products for wholesale. Their fertilizer products are prepared by mixing reagents manufactured at other facilities; no chemical reagents are manufactured at the SAF facility. \n2.\tDescription of Process This RMP covers the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia. There is one nominally sized 18,000-gallon vessel dedicated to the storage of Anhydrous Ammonia; the verified capacity of the vessel is 18,000 gallons; only one vessel is used; therefore, the maximum volume of Anhydrous Ammonia is considered in the covered process is 18,000 gall"

It should be noted that the maximum fill is approximately 85% for safe operation of the vessel \nC.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) (2745.4) Well-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential hazards at the stationary source. SAF conducted offsite consequence analysis, using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP*COMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines for the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS), and using (EPA'S) RMP*COMP as the dispersion model for the Alternative Release Scenario (ARS). SAF developed these analyses to determine a reasonable \"outer bound\" for emergency response planning and for explaining potential hazards to the community if affected. \n1.\tWorst-Case Scenario The Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) for toxic substances at SAF is the release of the total contents of a single storage vessel capable of containing 18,000 gallons (92,700) of 98% Anhydrous Ammonia.  A safe fill level of 85%, results in a calculated maximum of 79,560 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. No credit was given for passive mitigation measures such as a containment area, as the area was assumed to have been destroyed due to an earthquake or tornado. Modeling using default conditions generated the maximum distance to the toxic end point of 0.14 ppm (Appendix A to Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Subchapter 1 Table of Toxic Endpoints) for this WCS is 2.2 miles. Using census data from WWW.CENSUS.GOV, the estimated population within the WCS toxic endpoint circle is 4717 persons. \n2.\tAlternative Release Scenario. The Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for toxic substances at Brandt is the release of  a portion of a single storage vessel capable of containing 79,560 Anhydrous Ammonia. Credit was taken for an excess flow valve serving as passive mitigation, and as a result"

Using census data from WWW.CENSUS.ORG, the estimated population within the toxic endpoint circle is 30 persons. \nD.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n1.\tManagement System A management system has been developed to satisfy the requirements of the RMP regulation and ensures that the risk management program elements are developed and continually improved. All records associated with the prevention program elements are retained for a minimum of five years; some items must be retained for the life of the process. The plant manager is responsible for the overall RMP program elements at SAF. The Plant Manager is responsible for Planning, Organizing, Implementing, and Controlling the RMP Program.  Additional items: process training, process maintenance, process access control.\n2.\tChemical-Specific Prevention Steps SAF has assembled the Process Safety Information, performed hazard reviews, and developed written standard operating procedures that address the potential failure modes identified in the hazard reviews to minimize the potential for release. The storage area has been provided with a limited containment area to reduce the potential impact of a release should one occur. SAF believes that employees who clearly understand how to operate the Anhydrous Ammonia system safely can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents and increase efficiency. Therefore, a thorough training program focused on procedures is a key element of an effective prevention program.\n3.\tPrevention Program Elements SAF Prevention Program Elements consist of: \na.\tSafety Information SAF maintains the following safety information related to the regulated substances, processes, and equ"

In addition, operators must be trained in any procedures developed in the hazard review. Training must be conducted to comply with OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (CFR 1910.1200). Knowledgeable in-house personnel conduct this training. The Plant Manager maintains initial and refresher training records, including training content, instructor, and means used to verify competency for maintenance employees. Maintenance Documented procedures for maintaining the mechanical integrity of process equipment are maintained on-site, and maintenance personnel are trained in the maintenance procedures. A schedule for inspecting and testing equipment associated with the covered process has been established per (CFR 1926.1412). Compliance Audit The RMP for the covered process is reviewed Tri-annually by all full-time employees. Incident Investigation; Each incident that resulted in or could have resulted in (i.e., near miss) a catastrophic release of Anhydrous Ammonia must be investigated to satisfy the requirements of the regulations. Personnel will identify underlying cause(s) and develop and implement actions to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or similar incidents or corrective actions to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or similar incidents.

E. The Emergency Response Program (SAF) includes a Consolidated Emergency Response/Contingency Plan. The plan lists emergency containment and cleanup procedures, emergency equipment on-site, and telephone numbers to contact in an emergency. Internal response will occur, and evacuation maps will be posted on-site. Neighboring facilities that may be affected by an off-site release will be contacted via telephone. The most recent review or update of the emergency response plan will be conducted on January 21, 2025. Employee training on the plan took place on January 21st, 2025. The primary local emergency response agencies with which the plan is coordinated are the Hamilton County LEPC and the Aurora, NE Fire Department.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety SAF has established an increased schedule in safety training events to ensure emergency preparedness."
