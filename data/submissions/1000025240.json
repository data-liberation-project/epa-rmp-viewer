Emergency response procedures within this manual describe actions for incidental response for facility personnel in the event of a relatively small leak or release that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  If incidental response activities do not halt the release or the release poses an immediate safety or health hazard, specially trained response personnel are contacted to take over response activities.  In the event of a chlorine leak or release, employees are instructed to assess the situation and to determine if it is safe to discontinue the leak without the help of emergency responders.  If there are any doubts as to the safety of the release, the employees are to initiate the written notification procedures.  Details to these procedures are found in Section 7.0 of the manual.\r\n\r\nCurrent safety features installed at the facility include the leak detection system, 24 hr/day on-site personnel, and a covered storage area to protect the cylinders from the heating effects of direct sunlight.

This facility is subject to requirements of this program due to the usage and storage of chlorine in an amount greater than 2,500 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located outside the city limits of New Iberia, LA at the end of Parker St., off of LA Highway 87.  The area surrounding the facility consists of agricultural fields and residential subdivisions to the north and south of the plant.  The latitude and longitude of the facility were obtained from GPS coordinates.\r\n\r\nThis treatment includes the chlorination of the water supply prior to being disposed of into the Bayou Teche.  The Chlorine is mixed with water in the injection room at a rate that is automatically controlled by the amount of incoming wastewater.  Once the chlorine is injected into the water it is diluted to an amount, which is less than 1% chlorine, by weight.  The chlorine-water mixture is then routed to the contact chamber where the wastewater is treated.  The part of this process that is subject to the RMP requirements begins with the chlorine supply (2-1 ton cylinders) and ends at the point where it is mixed with the water.  The facility uses approximately one cylinder of chlorine every month.  The wastewater plant stores a maximum of two-one ton cylinders (4,000 lbs.) of chlorine at any one time.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario chlorine involves the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)- Determination of worst-case release quantity.  This type of release may occur as a result of catastrophic natural or other unforeseen disaster.  A release of 2,000 lbs. for a duration of 10 minutes results in a 1.3-mile distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine.  This endpoint, develop"

This distance encompasses mostly farmland and a few residential subdivisions, from LA Hwy 182 at Nelson Canal Road to Tete Bayou just before Crochet Rd. and from Neco Town Road at the power station to just before LA Hwy 86.  According to the 2010 Census results, the maximum population density in this area is approximately 1,000 people per square mile.  It is estimated that the worst-case circle encompasses approximately 1.325 square miles, resulting in a population of approximately 1,325 people residing within the worst-case release circle.  Refer to Section 5.0 for the vicinity map, which depicts the worst-case release circle, and for details of the public and environmental receptors.\r\n\r\nAn alternative case or a more likely release of chlorine could occur as the result of a cracked or split hose, sudden hose un-coupling, seal failures, over-pressurization, holes formed in ton cylinders as a result of punctures or corrosion, valve faulures, regulator seal, or gasket leak.  The plant is equipped with a leak detection system that has sensors located near the cylinders and the plant employees are on-site 24 hours per day.  If 1-ppm leak of CL2 is detected an alarm will sound and according to facility personnel, it would take less than 1 minute for on-site personnel to respond by closing the flow valve and thus stopping the leak.  Assuming the chlorine flashes to the atmosphere at a rate of 410 lbs/min for a maximum of 5 minutes (2,050 lbs. of chlorine) the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.4 miles.  The area within 0.4 miles of the facility encompasses mostly farmland and a few residents located to the south and west of the facility.  Based on a maximum population density 1,000 p/mi2, the population within 0.4 miles of the facility is approximately 125.  This type of release is only expected to impact those persons in the i"
