Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Seminole Gas Company, LLC (Seminole).  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all Seminole facilities.  Seminole facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment with many engineering safeguards (i.e.: pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e: police department, fire department, etc.).\n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The Seminole Murphy Liquids Terminal is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substances at the facility include flammable chemical mixtures and individual chemicals.  Chemicals include Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture consisting of N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutane, propane and ethane.  Additional butane and propane are present.  Some chemicals on site have an RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The facility has four NGL storage tanks (3-60,000 gallon and 1-90,000 gallon), one 60,000 gallon butane storage tank and one 60,000 gallon propane storage tank.  Additionally, rail cars are normally transported offsite within 24 hours.  To be conservative, it was assumed that the 3-rail cars may remain onsite for 24-hours, and have therefore been included as a process and in offsite consequences analyses.\n\n(c) Worst-Case Release Scenario and Administrative/Mitigative Controls.  The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) have evaluated all process and determined the worst case as well as alternate would"

      "SummaryText": "be the rupture of the single larges NGL Product Storage Tank.  Such a release has the potential of the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when exposed to an ignition source.  Using the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequences Analysis calculation methodology for flammable substances, the WCRS distance/endpoint was calculated to be 0.5 miles from the process.  Based on this calculation, it was determined that 75 public receptors were potentially impaced, whereas the alternate was estimated to potentially impact 65 public receptors.  Various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits.  Administrative controls include utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility.  Mitigative (engineering) safeguards include such things as high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n(d) Hazard Communication Program.  Seminole has developed and implemented a Company Hazard Communication Program that ensures: 1) an MSDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2) all applicable containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled/marked; and 3) employees receive annual training on the Company's Hazard Communication Program.\n\n(e) Five Year Accident History.  The Seminole Murphy Liquids Terminal has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Seminole is always looking for ways to improve their safety program.  Seminole believes the effectiveness of the safety program is directly proportional to employee involvement and senior management support.  Two tasks are being performed: 1) current training programs are being evaluated and 2) monthly safety inspection performed by the people who operate and maintain the"
