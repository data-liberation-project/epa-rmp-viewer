Grant Compressor Station NGL Tank\n\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\nEquitable Production Company (Equitable) is committed to providing the optimum in employee and public health and safety. It is the policy of Equitable that each employee has a safe and healthful place to work. It is also the policy of the company to expect each employee to live up to the responsibility of following all safety rules and safe work practices. It is Equitable\u00bfs policy to coordinate adequate emergency response capabilities to handle an on site emergency regarding RMP covered chemicals. Equitable executes this policy through employee training, education and coordination with local emergency response agencies.Grant station is an unmanned facility with remote monitoring of critical parameters. The station is visited most days.\n\n\nFacility Description:\n\nEquitable Production Company's Grant compressor station has a location facility address of Gaston Caperton Drive,  State Route 119, Holden, WV 25625. Natural gas from surrounding production is compressed to a higher pressure. Water and natural gas liquids are removed from the gas and the gas is fed to a transmission pipeline, owned by others, for transportation to market.\n\nTreatment of this gas requires removal of water at high pressure with tri-ethylene glycol and the removal of hydrocarbon fractions with a higher molecular weight than ethane with a refrigeration system. The liquids produced from refrigeration are fed to a deethanizer to remove residual ethane and then fed to a remote storage tank where the liquids are stored prior to shipment by truck to a third party.\n\nThe mixtures of hydrocarbon liquids are categorized as iso pentane and can be stored to a maximum quantity of 168,000 pounds. The Grant Compressor Station is a remote and normally unmanned and monitored facility. It is not covered under the Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) of highly hazardous chemicals, 29C"

      "SummaryText": "FR1910.119. Therefore the facility is subject to Program 2 requirements as identified in the RMP.\n\n\nSummary of Hazards: \n\nIso pentane boils at 82\u00b0F and therefore is required to be stored in a pressure vessel. It is extremely flammable (1.4% - 8%) with a very low flash point (-60\u00b0F) and is more than twice as heavy as air. It will pool on the ground as a result of a storage leak and will vaporize to low areas because of its relative density to air (2.48) Ingestion of iso pentane can be fatal and requires the immediate attention of a physician.\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst case scenario for the liquids hydrocarbon storage tank is for the complete release of the tank capacity on to the ground with a resulting vapor cloud explosion or fire. The end point (1psi) is 0.4 miles based on the EPA software RMP*Comp\u00bf. There is no population in this radius of exposure and has potential for impacting one public receptor. (Community exposure based on Landview 6)\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario is a pipe leak on the outlet of the storage tank. This would result in a loss of 20% of the tank capacity (33000) =lbs) over a 24 hour period. The pressure end point is 0.2 miles with no impact on the community and potential for impacting one public receptor.\n\n\n\nHazard Review:\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) are conducted on each covered process every 5 years or when the process changes. A PHA of the process and storage area was completed on February 3rd 2005.  Equitable has prioritized the resulting recommendations for implementation.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nWritten operating procedures for the compressor station and liquid storage are kept at the facility for easy access to operations personnel. The last review and revision of the operating procedures was conducted in February 2005 prior to submission of the RMP.\n\n\nTraining:\n\nEquitable provides on the job training to employees responsible for operating the Grant compressor station and remote liquid storage.

      "SummaryText": "d communication and chemical training are provided to each operations employee each year.\n\n\nMaintenance:\n\nEquitable is developing a Preventive Maintenance Plan that compliments the Mechanical Integrity requirements as set forth by PSM. This program details the performance of inspections, tests and maintenance of pressure vessels, storage tanks, relief and vent system devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, alarms and interlocks that are part of the compressor station and remote liquid storage. Tests and inspections have been developed to follow applicable codes and standards and industry best practices.\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nCompliance audits will be conducted once every 5 years.\nAny changes to the RMP covered processes will be reported to the EPA within six months of the change along with a resubmittal of the RMP.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nIncident investigations are conducted for each incident that results in or could potentially result in a catastrophic release of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. \n\n\nFive Year Incident History:\n\nThere were no reportable Incidents in the last five years"
