      "SummaryText": "Spontex Inc. is a sponge manufacturing operation located near Columbia, Tennessee in Maury County.   Spontex utilizes carbon disulfide (CS2) as a process chemical in a viscose production process.  CS2 is shipped to Columbia, Tennessee by way of rail cars.  Spontex utilizes nitrogen to displace the CS2 and unload it from a railcar to two 10,500 gallon capacity storage tanks.  These storage tanks are located within a secondary containment dike filled with water, acting as a moat.  From the holding tanks, CS2 is pumped to a 55 gallon  \"measuring pot\" on an as needed basis and then gravity fed to the viscose process.  Spontex is considered a Program 3 facility,  worst case and alternative release scenarios were modeled, using the EPA RMP COMP program, and the impact information from each scenario is included within the RMP Submit Database.  Spontex is in required to comply with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP rules.  Key components to the prevention program are: high level training for plant operators, preventative maintenance programs, technological process and safety equipment, effective operating procedures, performance of hazard review, and the frequent inspection programs.   There has been one accident, which resulted in the on-site death of a contractor employee during a tank cleaning project in September of 2006.   The facility has an internal emergency response plan, which has been coordinated with the fire and police departments of Maury County.   The program includes an emergency notification plan and names the facility official that will be the incident commander.  Emergency response drills and evacuation drills are conducted every year followed by a critique of all involved. Planned changes to improve safety include installing stationary CS2 monitoring devices in the Baratte Room, purchasing newer emergency response equipment, and improving safety training."
