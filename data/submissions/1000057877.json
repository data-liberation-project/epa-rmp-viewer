Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety,\" so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities\n\n\n\nThe facility aims to produce electricity as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  Where toxics cannot be eliminated, such as in the case of aqueous ammonia, necessary for controlling air emissions, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.  \n\n\n\nOcean State Power has an active emergency prevention and response program specifically tailored for the facility.  In addition, a Facility Response Plan/Emergency Response Action Plan incorporates applicable safety and environmental regulations.  It is the responsibility of plant management to carry out these programs.\n\n\n\nThe first duty of OSP employees is to exercise care in the performance of work tasks to prevent an accident to self, co-workers, the public, or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nOSP is a 560 megawatt (MW) combined cycle turbine electric generating facility.  Figure 1 provides an orthographic photo for the site and Figure 2 provides an equipment layout.  The area surrounding the plant is gated and public access is restricted.  Natural gas, the primary fuel, is delivered by either Tenneco or Algonquin pipelines to metering stations located at the northeast property boundary.  In 2015, OSP brought back dual-fuel capability and now stores up to 2,000,000 gallons of ultra-low sulfur diesel onsite in two steel 1,000,000 gallon tanks.  \n\n\n\nThe power plant consists of two identical phases.  Each phase includes two GE Frame 7EA combustion turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG)/boilers with supplemental "

Auxiliary equipment includes an electrical switchyard, wet mechanical cooling towers, and a zero discharge water treatment system.  Other facility components include selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems; two 150-foot concrete stacks equipped with continuous emissions monitoring systems; two emergency diesel generators; and oil and chemical storage.  The plant is operated from the control room.  Operators have access to plant operating data from the computerized distributed control system (DCS) and a central data acquisition and handling system (DAHS).\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia (29%) is the only regulated substance used in a process that is above the RMP threshold quantity.  Ammonia is used as a reducing agent for the SCR NOx emissions control system for the combustion turbines.  Aqueous ammonia is evaporated in hot air and injected into the flue gases upstream of a catalyst located in the heat recovery boilers to convert NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.  The amount of ammonia injected and the NOx/NH3 emissions in the exhaust stack gases are continuously measured and recorded.  The SCR system is comprised of subsystems - aqueous ammonia unloading area, a storage tank to provide four weeks capacity (e.g. 60,000 gallons), two ammonia transfer pumps (one back-up) to transfer solution to the four ammonia flow control/evaporator units, and four ammonia injection systems (one per HRSG).  The unloading area includes an unloading pump rated for eighty gallons per minute (gpm) with vapor recovery, and concrete berm to collect an accidental spill from truck delivery.  The ammonia storage tanks, of which one is active and one is backup, is located within the bermed area adjacent to the Water Treatment tank farm.  There are several interlock functions within the ammonia supply line that could activate an emergency shutoff valve.  Isolation valves and a bypass valve are provided as a contingency, should the ammoni"

The release scenario analyses accounted for EPA's recent determination that the outer wall of the ammonia tank may not be considered passive mitigation.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario assumes failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank that results in the total 60,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia being released in a 10-minute period.  The alternative release scenario assumes damage to the 300-gal ammonia surge tank within the unloading area berm, causing a release of its full contents to the area.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoints are:\n\n\n\n?    4.5 miles for worst-case release scenario\n\n?    0.1 miles for alternative release scenario\n\n    \n\nThe residential population within the worst-case scenario radius is 22,390 per the MARPLOT US Census data.

The primary goal is to protect the health and safety of plant personnel and the public, then to minimize damage to the environment, and then to minimize damage to plant equipment in the unlikely event of an accident.  An Incident Commander/Qualified Individual (IC/QI) is responsible for implementing and overseeing emergency response activities onsite.  If the primary IC is not available, alternate IC have received adequate training and have been delegated authority.  All managers, senior control room operators, and compliance personnel onsite have received training to serve as IC/QI if necessary.  The facility's FRP/ERAP provides actions for proper notifications within OSP's emergency response organization to activate necessary resources.  \n\n\n\nOSP has an ongoing employee health and safety training program conducted by qualified instructors.  Specific training includes Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, hazardous material handling, and ammonia-specific training.  Facility personnel are trained in functional areas that correspond to their emergency response duties and responsibilities.  Drills are conducted annually to test the procedures in the plans, verify the contact numbers, and practice deployment of spill response equipment and donning/doffing of personal protective equipment.  The goal is to exercise procedures and maintain readiness.  Integrated drills are conducted in conjunction with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Harrisville and Uxbridge Fire Departments, state/federal regulators, and other stakeholders to coordinate offsite emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe OSP facility is equipped with locally-annunciating alarms and a facility-wide public address system to alert personnel in the event of an emergency.

These procedures include immediate notification to authorities, establishing an Incident Command Post, evacuation of personnel, and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nSite processes to store and handle ammonia have been reviewed in the preparation of this RMP.  Several areas for improvement have been identified and are being implemented.  Ammonia handling at the plant falls within several processes:  ammonia unloading, ammonia heating, and ammonia injection.  In response to these processes and deficiencies noted within our previous plan, there have been several programs added at OSP to address hazards in conjunction with processes previously in place.  These hazard analyses will be reviewed as a group to include management, compliance, operations, and maintenance every three years during ammonia-specific training; additional hazards or strategies to avoid hazardous identified will be included in the compliance audit and addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nPersonnel have been trained in all ammonia system procedures, including the unloading procedure and the ammonia injection system work instructions.
