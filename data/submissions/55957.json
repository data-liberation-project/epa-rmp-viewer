      "SummaryText": "The implementation of this RMP is designed to reduce, and ultimately prevent, the risks of an accidential release of chlorine gas from 1T containers of liquified gas chlorine.  The Bozeman Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine to disinfect drinking water for the city.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored at the WTP is six, 1T containers, although only 1 container is online at a time.  As noted in this RMP, all WTP have been involved in the development and implementation of standard operating procedures that minimize the opportunity for an accidental release.  All WTP personnel have been trained in the standard operating procedures, including proper handling, equipment maintenance, and personal protection.  The WTP works directly with local emergency responders and the HazMat Team in planning and mitigating to any accidential releases.  The WTP has an ERP that includes preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery for the accidental release of chlorine.  The ERP includes continued development, and exercises.\n\nSafety of WTP personnel is the top priority.  Only small chlorine leaks will be repaired by WTP personnel.  Any significant chlorine release wil activate the ERP and WTP personnel will be evacuated.  The ERP coverall aspects of the WTP personnel after evacuation including HazMat contact.\n\nThis RMP will be updated and modified as necessary to be alligned with local emergency response plans. In 2011 the City of Bozeman will have a new water treatment plant and the use of gas chlorine will be discontinued."
