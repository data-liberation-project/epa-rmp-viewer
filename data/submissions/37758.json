Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Cargill Juice - Avon Park facility is a citrus processing and storage facility, located in Avon Park, Florida.  Cargill Juice management requires the facility to develop and maintain accident preveion programs and an emergency action plan appropriate to the site.\n\n2.  The Cargill Juice - Avon Park facility is located at 1552 Sunpure Road, in Avon Park, Florida.  The facility consists of areas for processing and freezer storage of citrus products for distribution.\n\nThe Cargill Juice - Avon Park facility has an ammonia refrigeration system which exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the machine or compressor room.  The high pressure receiver (HPR) is located inside the compressor room.  The HPR is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system, capable of holding approximately 26,520 lbs. of ammonia.  This vessel was used to determine the OCA for the facility.\n\n3.  Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity for its ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this also places the Cargill Juice refrigeration process in the Program 3 Prevention Program level.  The Cargill Juice facility uses its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe PSM Program includes a preventive maintenance plan, which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Cargill Juice facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation a"

      "SummaryText": "nd included information on safety devices.  These procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics that work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, are in place to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components include complete equipment information, piping and instrumentation diagrams, and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies when found.  These actions ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment informatin is available when needed.  A Process Hazard Analysis has been conducted.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program development effort receives full support of plant management and involves employees at all levels.\n\n4.  Accident History\n\nThe Cargill Juice Avon Park facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Cargill Juice Avon Park plant has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Avon Park Fire Deparment and Hazardous Matertials Response Team, and the Region #7 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notiying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (813) 534-7130."
