      "SummaryText": "Hopewell Power Station is an electric generation facility.  The facility includes two biomass-fired stoker boilers, each equipped with selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) and an over-fire air system in order to comply with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions required by U.S. EPA's NOx CAIR, as implemented through Virginia's NOx Budget Trading Program Rule (9 VAC 5 Chapter 140) and EPA's Section 126 Rule.  One hazardous material is stored in a reportable quantity, anhydrous ammonia.  The SNCR process injects anhydrous ammonia into the boiler flue gas stream, where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in a 15,000 gallon tank limited to 85% of maximum capacity (12,750 gallons) through administrative controls.  The tank, piping system, and safety devices are designed and constructed to comply with applicable federal codes and regulations.  All tank process connections are equipped with internally mounted excess flow valves and a check valve on the liquid fill line to shut off the flow of liquid or vapor should a pipe rupture occur.  The tank is enclosed by a concrete berm and contains chemical sensors to detect small releases.  The tank is also equipped with other safety devices: pressure relief valves set at 50 to 60 psig; an overpressure alarm system; an emergency shut-off system; a fogging system; and pressure, temperature, and level indicators.\n\n\n\nHopewell Power Station has maintained a strong safety and accidental release prevention program. The facility's ammonia storage and handling is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Hopewell Power Station's operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail for safely conducting activities involving the unloading, storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, each employee involved in operating the ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia process is further trained in emergency operations.  Plant personnel strictly adhere to the written maintenance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the tank, piping system, and emergency shutdown systems.  These activities include periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices.  Furthermore, Hopewell Power Station ensures that any changes to the ammonia process or plant equipment and systems are managed by implementing a hazard analysis, a root cause failure analysis, and safety procedures before modifications occur.  Hopewell Power Station has taken great care to ensure the anhydrous ammonia system is properly designed, maintained, and operated.  Because the ammonia storage and handling is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, audits and inspections are performed periodically to identify changes to improve safety.  These changes are evaluated and implemented as required by the regulation.  Chemical safety training through first aid, emergency contingency plans, Hazard Communication, and PPE programs reinforce the criticality of chemical safety to operations personnel.  Operations personnel conduct inspections on every shift to minimize the consequences of potential leaks or process problems. The emergency response program includes the training mentioned above, both announced and unannounced annual drills, emergency horns and radio communications at the facility.  Hopewell Power Station has a qualified contracting agency on standby that will respond to chemical spills and cleanup operations, and we have confirmed our inclusion with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\nThe company's prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  Hopewell Power Station has never had a reportable release of ammonia.  It does have an emergency response plan which meets OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER) and accidental releas"

The plan also includes evacuation procedures and leak isolating procedures, if it is safe to do so."
