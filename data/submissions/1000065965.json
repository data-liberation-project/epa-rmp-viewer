      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION:\n\n\n\nThe Town of Guilderland Water Treatment Plant, located in the Northeast Industrial Park (Park) of Guilderland Center, utilizes chlorine as a disinfectant. Chlorine is labeled a toxic chemical, and the water treatment plant maintains amounts above the threshold limit as dictated by the Clean Air Act, ?112 (2,500 lbs). The intended maximum quantity to be maintained onsite is 4,000 pounds of liquefied gaseous chlorine, delivered as two separate 1-ton tanks. These two tanks are stored in an enclosed portion of the plant that is equipped with a chlorine sensor that is sensitive to concentrations of 10 ppm or greater. The plant also has an external audible and visual alarm as well as a SCADA system to notify the on-call operator.  As a result of recommendations from the previous Compliance Audit and PHA, annual inspections, testing, and cleaning of plant equipment continue to be performed. An outside specialist is hired to both inspect and test several pieces of equipment in the water treatment plant including alarm system, feed equipment, chemical injectors, chemical feed lines, and SCADA.  All controllers are also cleaned at this time.  \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS:\n\n\n\nToxic Worst Case:\n\n\n\nThe guidance document \"General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention\" included reference to an EPA software program, \"RMP Comp\", which was designed to perform the calculations required by the Offsite Consequence Analysis. This program was utilized to determine the quantitative results of the most probable Worst-Case Scenario Release. The threat of a worst case release is most probable during transfer of the full tank(s), one of which presents the single largest vessel, to or from the chemical delivery truck, and was therefore the basis of the calculations. Only one full tank is intended to be delivered at a time and the Worst-Case Scenario assumes that it is accidentally released outside of the chlorine room. In this scenario no pas"

The program \"MARPLOT\" was used to determine the population within the 3.0-mile distance-to-endpoint.  Marplot output indicated a population of 10,138 could potentially be affected by such a release.\n\n\n\nToxic Alternative Release:\n\n\n\n\"RMP Comp\", which was designed to perform the calculations required to by the Offsite Consequence Analysis, was utilized to determine the quantitative results of the most probable Alternative Scenario Release. The threat of an alternative release is most probable during hook-up of a full tank, and was therefore the basis of the calculations. If the valve on newly delivered tank is closed too tightly, the pressure exerted when opening the valve may potentially shear it off. The resulting leak will be 5/16 in diameter and will occur in the chlorine room. Therefore, enclosure can be considered as passive mitigation in this scenario.\n\n\n\nAssuming a full tank is released (2,000 lbs); the duration of the release is 137 minutes. The distance-to-endpoint, from the center of the release, is 0.2 miles. The program \"Marplot\" was used to determine the population within this distance.  The population within the 0.2 distance-to-endpoint was, and continues to be, 0.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThe Guilderland Water Treatment Plant has not had any accidents within the last five (5) years, and therefore has no accident investigation reports on file at Town Hall.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION:\n\n\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted using the What If/Checklist method from Appendix F, \"Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\", from the guidance document \"General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68)\". The PHA identified potential hazards such as accidental release, corrosion, fire, human er"

The causes and consequences of each hazard were identified and evaluated to determine whether the employed safeguards are adequate, and recommendations were made to improve plant safety if necessary. This file will be kept at the WTP. The Accidental Release Prevention policies are kept onsite in the lab. In addition to the chemical delivery procedures, the following procedures are effectively implemented at the plant:\n\n\n\n1.    Always have two persons present with moving containers or making connections.\n\n2.    Always use a new lead washer when making connections.\n\n3.    Immediately upon opening valve, check all connections for leaks using ammonia vapors. If a leak is detected in the flexible line or fittings, close the valve. Retighten the fitting and change the lead washer if necessary. Do not allow leaks to continue.\n\n4.    Keep full containers stored in a clean, dry, well controlled and ventilated area.\n\n5.    Keep valve wrenches, tools, and ammonia ready for use.\n\n6.    Always work leaks from gas side of tank. (Not liquid)\n\n7.    Periodically review all procedures.\n\n\n\nAn updated compliance audit was also conducted to ensure compliance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart D Program 3 Prevention Program. The audit was conducted as a checklist and answers such as yes, no, or not applicable were designated to each subsection and requirement of the rule. A full report is on file at the WTP.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE RESPONSE:\n\n\n\nThe Guilderland Water Treatment Plant policy for responding to chlorine leaks is as follows:\n\n\n\n1.    Secure the area.\n\n2.    Evaluate the problem.\n\n3.    Initiate Emergency Response Procedures (below).\n\n4.    Using extreme caution, proceed with two (2) person entry.\n\n5.

The following represents a brief summary of the written procedures:\n\n\n\nMonitoring & Detection: Chlorine is used in a separate room at the Guilderland Water Treatment Plant (WTP). One to three plant operators are on duty seven days a week (no later than 4:30 p.m.), and from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on holidays. Additionally, one operator is on call 24 hours a day.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine leak detector is located in the chlorine room and activates a red light mounted outside the door when the chlorine content in the room is at, or above, 10 parts per million. The guards at the security gate of the Park make rounds 24 hours a day and are instructed to call the Guilderland Police in the event of any problem. \n\n\n\nOperators are required to check the chlorine room and operating systems for leaks twice daily. All plant employees regularly attend safety classes and are familiar with the Material Safety Data Sheets and the Operations Manual for the WTP.\n\n\n\nNotification: When the WTP is staffed, leaks will be reported to the Senior Operator. If a leak is discovered by Park personnel after hours, they will call 911 and the operator on call will be notified. The on call operator will then notify the Guilderland police, Albany County DOH, DEC, DOT, Jones Chemical Inc., Chem Tec, WTP staff, etc. as appropriate.\n\n\n\nEmployee Evacuation & Control: Upon notification, all WTP employees will be evacuated to the Park's Main Gate or upwind. The security guards at the main gate will be notified and are responsible for notifying all Park tenants and employees, as well as controlling entrance to and exit from the Park. If the WTP is contaminated, the Park's main gate will serve as the command center.\n\n\n\nContainment: All efforts shall be made to control or stop the release of chlorine from the tank.
