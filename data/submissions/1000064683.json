The City has developed and implemented the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Prevention Program which provides a systematic approach to employee involvement, safety awareness, emergency response, risk management, and program assessment related to chlorine facilities at the plant.\r\nPLANT DESCRIPTION\r\nThe Miramar Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was originality built in the early 1960s and treats water for the northern portion of the City of San Diego and for sale to other agencies. The Miramar Water Treatment Plant has a maximum water treatment capacity of 215 million gallons per day (MGD). The Miramar Water Treatment Plant is located adjacent to the south shore of Lake Miramar Reservoir in a predominantly residential area in the northern portion of the City of San Diego. The surrounding terrain is relatively hilly. Currently, there is a significant amount of existing residential development to the south, west, and east of the facility, and there is a significant amount of existing commercial development to the west of the facility. The Miramar WTP currently uses chlorine to disinfect water from Miramar Reservoir and the California Aqueduct, making it suitable for use in the City of San Diego's drinking water distribution system and for sale to other agencies. The chlorine is received in one-ton pressurized liquid containers at the secured Chlorine Storage Room of the Chlorine Building. The Chlorine Storage room is equipped to store a maximum inventory of\r\n38 containers fo"

The most recent upgrades were implemented in 2011 (see Table 3-1 in Section 3).\r\nCOMMITMENT\r\nThe Miramar Water Treatment Plant has a well-trained and committed operations and maintenance staff with a record of over 40 years of using chlorine safely. To support the efforts of continued safe handling and use of chlorine at the Miramar Water Treatment Plant, senior management has committed to the development of a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program under the guidelines of State and Federal mandates which has\r\n \r\ninvolved complete engineering reviews of the chlorine storage and feed system and design certification.\r\nPROGRAM COMPLIANCE\r\nThe Risk Management Prevention and Process Safety Management Programs have been developed and implemented. The Risk Management Prevention Program is in fulfillment of the requirements of 40 CFR PART 68 within Section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations (Title 19, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations). The Process Safety Management Program is in fulfillment of the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) 1910.119, as well as Cal/OSHAs California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials.\r\nAs with the use of any hazardous chemicals, the use of chlorine in this treatment process poses the potential for an accidental release that could have offsite consequences. It is for this reason that several years ago, under the provisions of the Risk Management Program Rule (40 CFR PART 68), an assessment of potential offsite consequences of accidental release scenarios of chlorine to the surrounding environment was conducted at the Miramar Water Treatment Plant. Under the provisions of the rule, the treatment process at the Miramar Water Treat"

Incorporated into the Risk Management Plan (RMP) was the analysis of potential offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release. This analysis produces information related to the residential population and public and environmental receptors which may be affected in the event of an accidental chlorine release.\r\nSAFETY ELEMENTS\r\nSafety elements can be defined as either administrative or engineering controls.\r\nAdministrative elements include: 1) procedural requirements, 2) training, 3) operator certification, and 4) the City's policy and commitment of resources.\r\nEngineering elements include physical modifications of facilities to 1) detect, 2) contain, 3) treat, 4) warn, and/or 5) eliminate a potential incident. \r\n\r\nThe following engineering upgrades were made to enhance the management and mitigation of an accidental chlorine release (see Table 3-1 in Section 3 for dates of implementation/review):\r\n\r\n1)\tChlorine leak detection sensors were installed in the chlorine container storage building and feed system. These sensors activate alarms within the plant when low levels of chlorine are detected within the Chlorine Storage Building.\r\n2)\tA computerized process control program allows the Duty Plant Operator to see immediately from the Operations Control Room what part of the chlorine feed system is alarming, (and at what chlorine concentration) without leaving the control room.\r\n3)\tAn automatic chlorine shut-off system was installed to minimize a chlorine release by enabling the operator to stop the chlorine feed at the cylinder in the event of a release.\r\n4)\tAn automatic switchover system was installed, which allows for the automated switchover from the two on-line containers to the two standby containers.\r\n \r\n5)\tA fully enclosed building was constructed to contain chlorine vapor in the even"

The scrubber system is capable of neutralizing 2,000 lbs. of chlorine.\r\nThe following administrative safety controls have been implemented:\r\n1)\t\tSeveral safe-work-practices for the operations and maintenance sections have been developed in conjunction with other safety programs to insure employees work and respond to incidents safely. The Miramar Water Treatment Plant, in conjunction with the Public Utilities Department Emergency Management Coordinator, have developed and tested a Chlorine Emergency Response Plan. The Chlorine Emergency Response Plan was developed to support the Water Plant staff in the event of a chlorine release in which additional resources are required to mitigate the situation. The San Diego Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team (HIRT) is dedicated to respond to the plant in the event of an incident which exceeds the response capabilities of the plant staff. The Miramar Water Treatment Plant maintains a Business Plan that identifies evacuation points on the site and provides additional emergency information about chlorine and additional contacts if needed. All personnel assigned to this site are trained and certified on the provisions of this Business Plan.\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of the regulated substance at the Miramar Water Treatment Plant in the past 5 years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\r\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance audit was conducted by the Department's Production Engineering Team and the Plant's senior management in January of 2017"

The purpose of the audit was to evaluate the adequacy of the PSM and RMP programs and provide recommendations for improvements as needed. The Audit Report is included in the Appendix of the RMP.\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe City of San Diego has trained and certified all plant staff to the level of first responder. Additional support will be provided by the San Diego Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team (HIRT). In the event HIRT is required, plant staff can mobilize all necessary resources with a single radio or telephone call. In addition, an automated dialing system has been installed. This system automatically contacts relevant responders (HIRT and/or plant staff) in the event that a chlorine concentration threshold is detected by the gas sensors in the Chlorine Room. All relevant design and operations of chlorine facilities at Miramar WTP have received thorough review by the Fire Department\r\n \r\nprior the construction or implementation. Fire Department staff have worked closely with plant staff to develop a thorough familiarity with the operation of chlorine facilities in order to facilitate efficient emergency response.\r\nPLANNED CHANGES\r\nThe Miramar Water Treatment Plant has received numerous engineering upgrades throughout the last decade. Facilities installed recently or currently in construction including:\r\n1.\tInstallation of an automatic paging system for critical alarms (complete).\r\n2.\tInstallation of a notification system for 'man down' scenarios (complete).\r\n3.\tThe replacement of the two clearwells (construction is underway).\r\nThe City of San Diego Public Utilities Department and the Miramar Plant staff are committed to providing 'state of the art facilities that produce high quality drinking water while protecting the environment and the health and safety of plant staff and the public."
