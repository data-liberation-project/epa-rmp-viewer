      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n40 CFR 68\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nINTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY ? TEXARKANA MILL\n\nInternational Paper Company owns and operates the Texarkana pulp and paper mill located in Cass County, Texas.  The Texarkana Mill produces bleached paper-grade Kraft and is permitted to produce 817,803 air-dried unbleached tons of pulp per year (ADUBT/yr).  Pulp is bleached via an elemental chlorine free process using chlorine dioxide and other chemicals.\n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program has been codified under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR Part 68), and referred to herein as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  The RMP includes three major parts:  hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nInternational Paper is committed to operating and maintaining all processes at the Texarkana Mill in a safe and responsible manner.  International Paper continuously trains the mill employees in operating procedures and performs ongoing preventative maintenance on process equipment. The Texarkana Mill uses a combination of accidental release prevention program and emergency response planning program to manage the hazards associated with the regulated chemicals used at the mill.  By maintaining these programs, the Texarkana Mill ensures the safety of on-site personnel as well the safety of the public and the protection of the environment.\n\nRMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Texarkana Mill has identified two toxic chemicals used at the mill that are listed in 40 CFR ?68.130.  The chemicals occur in processes, as defined by 40 CFR ?68.3, such that the quantity in the process exceeds corresponding threshold quantities specified in 40 CFR ?68.130.  The toxic chemicals that are covered (i.e., regulated) by the RMP rule include chlorine dioxide and chlorine.\n\nSolvay and single vessel process using methanol (SVPM) processes generates aqueous chlorine dioxide soluti"

      "SummaryText": "on (ClO2) for the beaching process at the Texarkana Mill.  Under 40 CFR Part 68, a process, which stores or handles an aqueous solution with a concentration greater than or equal to the de minimis concentration (1% by weight) and a total quantity greater than or equal to the threshold quantity (1,000 pounds for chlorine dioxide), is regulated by the RMP rule.  The generated aqueous ClO2 solution is pumped to four large outdoor tanks for storage and process use at a maximum concentration of 10 g/L (1% by weight).  Tanks 1 and 2 are located within a common dike.  Tank 1 has a maximum storage capacity of 105,800 gallons of solution (8,800 pounds ClO2) and Tank 2 has a maximum storage capacity of 188,000 gallons of solution (15,700 pounds ClO2).  Tanks 3 and 4 are also located within a common dike that is separate from Tanks 1 and 2.  Tanks 3 and 4 each have a maximum storage capacity of 200,000 gallons of solution (16,700 pounds ClO2).  Therefore, ClO2 in the bleaching process is covered by the RMP rule.\n\nChlorine is stored for water treatment in standard one-ton (2000 pounds) cylinders.  In one location, 18 cylinders are arranged in three parallel storage racks of six cylinders per rack.  At any one time, at least one rack of cylinders (i.e., six cylinders) is interconnected through a supply header.  This interconnection yields a process quantity of at least 12,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity for Cl2 of 2,500 pounds.  In another location of the facility, five one-ton Cl2 cylinders are stored together in a rack, but only two cylinders are connected to a supply header.  This interconnection yields a process quantity of at least 4,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Both chlorine processes are located inside sheltering buildings.  Therefore, two covered processes apply to chlorine.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances from the covered processes in the Texarkana "

Local emergency responders are trained for emergencies that may be encountered at the mill.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Texarkana Mill is continually improving its operations to provide a safe work environment.  Such improvements include training, alarm systems, mitigation measures, and thorough incident investigation/corrective action programs"
