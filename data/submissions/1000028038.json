We use anhydrous ammonia to freeze salmon and other species of seafood whole or filleted.  Our ammonia inventory is in excess of 10,000 pounds, and in accordance with the OSHA and EPA requirements, we have developed a Process Safety Management and a Risk Management Program.\n\nThere is a management system describing overall responsibility for the program and there is a person responsible for each element of the PSM/RM program.  Initially there was a Process Hazard Analysis completed for the facility.  Every 5 years or more often, this process hazard analysis will be reviewed and updated.  Most of the elements of our program are reviewed and updated yearly.  Every three years there will be a complete audit to insure compliance of the PSM/RM standard.  The refrigeration facility has been constructed following local, state and industry code requirements and guidelines.\n\nThe freezing plant combines with an existing cannery and flake ice making machinery to provide for the best utilization of seafood products.  The Process Safety Management/ Risk Management program combines with other Trident safety programs which involves participation from top management to the entry level worker.\n\nA Hazard Assessment has been completed which considers a worse case ammonia release scenario as well as several alternate or more likely to occur accidents.  This study has been used to develop the facility emergency action plan.  \n\nThere have been no accidents, injuries, or property damage resulting from an ammonia release in the last 5 years.  \n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the facility Emergency Action Plan would be implemented.  The facility first responders will provide proper measures to safely evacuate plant personnel to pre-arranged muster areas.  There is ammonia detection installed which will automatically notify the"

Appropriate community notification will be made for either emergency evacuation or possible \"shelter in place\" instructions.\n\nFacility personnel are provided personal protective equipment for their level of involvement and trained for emergency response yearly.  There are emergency plant evacuation drills practiced seasonally.  This ensures that each person will know what to do and where to go in the event of any emergency.\n\nThis facility holds monthly safety meetings with all management staff, lead personnel and other team members where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment. Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon.  Systems and procedures are reviewed and updated; in many cases, at least annually, to assure that all operations are being done is a safe and effective manner.\n\n"
