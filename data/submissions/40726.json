Health, safety and environmental compliance are afundamental part of every employee's job. It is facility policy to adhere to applicable Federa, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respon in accordance with it's Emergency Response Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.                       Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility(the stationary source) is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct sale to farmers. The Maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia is approximately 298,560 lbs stored in two storage tanks. The maximum fill level of the tanks are 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.       \n\nThe accidenal release prevention program: The facility complies with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and Local codes and regulations.\n\nThe five year history: There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: Have caused any deaths, injuries,or significant property damage at the facility. Nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries,evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe emergency response program: The facility has a written emergency response action pla, provided local authorities the plan and Sara Title III, and includes pre emergency planning and employee training.\n\nPlann"

      "SummaryText": "ed changes to improve safety: Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Peridic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implemetation at this time.\n\nWorst case release scenario and alternate release scenario:\nThe worst case scenario would be the release co the entire contents of a storage tank, released as gas in ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 298,560 lbs. which represents the volume of storage at 85% of cpacity which is limited by design standards. The distance to endpoint is 4.4 miles.\nThe alternate release scenario involves the release  anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tank. The quanntity of ammonia released as a gas would be approximately 95 pounds."
