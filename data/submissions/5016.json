The resulting emergency response planning zone is defined by a circle with a radius equal to 25 miles.  \n\nThe worst-case planning zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 5,077,400, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's LANDVIEW III program.  The potential worst-case planning zone includes schools, public recreation areas and commercial areas.  \n\n3.2\tAlternative Release for Toxic Substances.\n\nThe alternative release examined for all of the 18 regulated chemicals corresponds to an accident occurring during on-site handling of a 55 gallon drum, where the drum is accidentally punctured by a fork truck. The unconfined spill was modeled with RMP*Comp to estimate endpoint distances for the 18 regulated substances that may at some time be present at the site.  The alternative scenario was simulated using meteorological conditions that are typical of the Chicago, Illinois area. In RMP*Comp, EPA uses meteorological conditions for alternative releases of D stability and a wind speed of 3 m/sec.  Stability Class D represents conditions of neutral stability, or moderate atmospheric turbulence.  Based on climatological data from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the average wind speed is about 4 m/sec, providing greater dilution than assumed in RMP*Comp.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling to determine the distance to toxic endpoint was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*COMP (Version 1.06) software.  As discussed in Section 3.1, the modeling was performed using the conservative assumption of urban surface roughness. The resulting planning zone is defined by a circle ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 miles, depending on the chemical spilled. The public area within these radii is limited. No environmental receptors would be affected.\n\n3.3\tWorst Case Release for Flammable Substances\n\nThe worst case for flammable substance is defined as a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest  amount of a regulated substance in a single ves"

Applying RMP*Comp results in an estimated worst-case endpoint distance of 0.05 miles for ethyl ether (90%). This zone extends just off-site and does not impact residential areas.\n\n3.4\tAlternative Flammable Release\n\nThe potential for a vapor cloud explosion resulting from an outdoor release of a flammable liquid is extremely unlikely. The alternative release is the spill of a 55 gallon drum resulting in a pool fire.  In this instance, the endpoint established by the ARP regulation is the radiant heat of 5 \nkW/m2  for 40 seconds.  Applying RMP*Comp results in an endpoint distance of 0.01 mi.  Thus, the impact of an alternative release does not extend beyond the facility fenceline.\n\n4.0   ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nClean Harbors has procedures in place to prevent and mitigate potential releases of toxic and flammable substances.  These procedures are detailed in CHSI's RCRA Part B hazardous waste license.  The procedures include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n* An inspection program which requires daily, monthly and annual inspections of process equipment, alarm systems, and management practices, with a procedure for documenting and correcting any deficiencies identified in inspections.\n\n* A standard operating procedure for the transfer of flammable and combustible liquids.\n\n* A standard operating procedure for ensuring that incompatible materials are not consolidated together.\n\n* A waste analysis plan which ensures that the waste received by CHSI conforms to the waste as initially represented by each generator, and that each waste stream is managed correctly.\n\n* A security plan to prevent unknowing or unwanted access to the facility.\n\n* A training plan which ensures that each employee at the facility is adequately trained to perform their job duties knowledgeably and safely.\n\nIn addition, consistent wi"

Flammable and toxic wastes are stored in separate areas.\n\nFlammable wastes are pumped from the drums and blended into larger tanks that contain  mixtures that have a NFPA rating of 3 or less.

In order to standardize and simplify to a practical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-case analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst case defined by the EPA methods and an alternative case, which is believed by Clean Harbors to more realistically represent situations that may possibly occur within the lifetime of the facility, are presented and described.

Since Clean Harbors does not process the following six chemicals: isopropyl chloroformate, methyltrichlorosilane, nitric acid, phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous trichloride, and trimethylchlorosilane, a worst case tank release was not calculated for those substances.  The worst-case release scenario for the Clean Harbors facility corresponds to a release from a railcar assumed to be filled with 30,000 gallons of pure propionitrile contained in a 1376 ft2 diked area.  Such a scenario is extremely unlikely because it would require that the contents of 545 55-gallon drums each containing the maximum concentration would be pumped into an otherwise empty railcar. \n\nEPA requires that worst-case analyses be conducted using stability class F and 1.5 m/sec"

The TSDF may be subject to these provisions because it is possible that threshold quantities of several specific regulated toxic and/or flammable liquids may be present in greater than threshold quantities.  Under most circumstances Clean Harbors' records indicate that regulated substances are present in concentrations below 1% and/or in less than the threshold quantities specified in the ARP regulation.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) which is prepared under the EPA's predictive filing provisions has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The RMP certifies that Clean Harbors has instituted a Risk Management Program that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \n\nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  This document identifies the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, including comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs.  In addition, this RMP identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five year accidental release history.

The most turbulent condition is stability A, which is associated with light winds and very strong solar heating.  Stabilities B and C are characterized by progressively weaker solar heating and stronger winds.  Neutral or D stability occurs when winds are strong or when the sky is overcast.  At night the earth's surface cools, causing the lower atmosphere to stabilize and become less turbulent.  Stability E (moderately stable) corresponds to partly cloudy conditions with moderate winds.  Stability class F (very stable) represents a very low level of turbulence due to overnight radiational cooling and weak winds.\n\nTo describe the aerodynamic surface roughness for modeling purposes, EPA has established surface roughness categories based on land-use type. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings, compact residential areas and trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are few buildings and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed by trees.  The Clean Harbors Chicago facility and vicinity are urban in nature.\n\nThe toxic endpoint selected by EPA for toxic substances is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.
