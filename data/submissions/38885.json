This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe ConAgra Foods \u00bf Hebrew National (ConAgra) facility in Indianapolis, Indiana has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has developed a well documented Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  More information about this aspect of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan \u00bfAmmonia Response\u00bf which is to ensure the safety of its employees\u00bf, the community, and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release \u00bf HAZMAT Team.  As part of this program, there is emergency response training and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  All of these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the ConAgra facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nConAgra is a producer of processed smoked kosher meat products (hot-dogs, sausage, salami, deli meats, corn beef pastrami, turkey).  The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311612.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.  ConAgra has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the"

      "SummaryText": "plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process is approximately 40,000 pounds.  The process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n \n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n3.\tEye contact\n\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nConAgra has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  At ConAgra, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA"

Thus, ConAgra\u00bfs ammonia PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM system elements are being implemented for the RMP document.  \n\nThe plant has created a very thorough and well-documented written PSM program which includes the following elements:  1) employee participation, 2) process safety information, 3) process hazard analysis, 4) operating procedures, 5) training, 6) contractor safety, 7) pre-startup review, 8) mechanical integrity, 9) hot work permit, 10) management of change, 11) incident investigation, 12) emergency planning and response, and 13) compliance audit.\n\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of ConAgra\u00bfs accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1999 \u00bf June 21, 2004.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the ConAgra facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called Emergency Action Plan.  This plan contains specific procedures for:  coordination with local authorities, emergency communication, emergency notification procedures, emergency evacuation procedures, personnel accounting procedures, notification of response groups, roles and lines of authority, emergency recognition and prevention, site security and control, medical first aid, decontamination, safe distances and places of refuge, personal protective equipment and emergency equipment (anhydrous ammonia emergencies), and critique of emergency action plan and follow-up.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan consists of all notifications and plant evacuation procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  The purpose of this plan is to summarize the existing policies, procedures, and plans of action to protect the team members of this facility and the general public from dangers associated with these emergencies and provide for the notification in event of an emergency.\n\n7.0\tPLANNED C"
