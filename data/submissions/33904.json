All AES people and others performing work on the company's behalf are expected to: adhere to the laws and regulations that pertain to their work; demonstrate ethical behavior in all their business relations and decisions; comply with all AES policies, codes and principles. Our commitment to values demand more than simply following the letter of the law. AES people must always do the right thing and put principles first.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  AES Somerset is the newest and largest coal-fired generation plant in New York State.  It is located on Route 18 along the south shore of Lake Ontario.  It is a single, 675 MW, coal-fired operating unit that began operations in 1984.  AES Somerset has installed a selective catalytic reduction unit to reduce Nitrogen Oxides (Nox) emissions from the plant.  The primary function of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system is to reduce boiler flue gas nitrogen oxide (Nox) emissions across a catalyst to nitrogen and water using anhydrous ammonia as a reducing agent.  The SCR system is comprised of: Catalytic Reactors; an Ammonia / Air Injection System; a Dilution Air Supply System; and an Ammonia Storage / Supply System.\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility maintains a compliance program to meet the requirements of OSHA's, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" for the SCR / Ammonia process.  Compliance with this regulation, and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps to prevent the release of anhydrous ammona from this process.  Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of anhydrous ammonia in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY"

The plan has been coordinated with the Niagara County LEPC.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  The facility personnel continually review the plant processes for improvements in safety, quality, and performance, and, the facility is periodically inspected by regulatory agencies for compliance with permit and regulatory requirements. Input from these sources is addressed as quickly as possible."
