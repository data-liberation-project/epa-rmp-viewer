As our most valuable asset, we place top priority in the informing, educating, protecting and preserving our employees as valuable members of the company.\n\nThe company's primary focus is to prevent the occurrence of an unforeseen industrial incident/accident from occuring in the work environment.\n\nFacility Descriptions and Regulated Substance\n\nThe operations at the facility consist of the processing of beef and speciality meat cuts.  The facility employs approximately 350 employees.  The refrigeration system at the facility comprises our process with the regulated substance being anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  This is a self contained system which provides the refrigeration for the facility.\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System Description\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single stage, closed loop system that is used to provide cooling for the process rooms, temperature control, water chilling and temper water for sanitation.  A minimal amount of freezer storage is maintained at the facility.  \n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no anhydrous ammonia related incidents identified for the facility in the previous five years which resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nTo accomplish the facility's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a multi-faceted safety program.  The objectives of the safety program are to achieve maximum effiency and safety performance.\n\nThe facility has implemented a prevention program for the accidental release of the NH3 process.  Elements of the program coincide with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119; EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation (RMP), 40 CFR Part 68; State of Wisconsin's Ref Code: Chapter 45, NH3 Refrigeration and LP Gas Inspection Report.

This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to anydrous ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  This program has been coordinated with the Fire Department and LEPC.  \n\nThe response plan includes such elements as Orgainizational Plan and Responsibilities, Communication Procedures, Action Plans, Emergency First Aid and Medical Treatment Procedure, Evacuation Procedures, Outside Assistance and Response Training.  \n\nSummary of the Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nGreen Bay Dressed Beef, LLC has diligently and procactively developed emergency response procedures to be followed in the unlikely event of a situation involving the release of anhydrous ammonia, which is commonly used in refrigeration systems in the food industry.  \n\nAs required by the EPA and to minimize the risk to our employees and surrounding community, the company has developed a hypothetical worst case scenario.  This model involves the release of 28,000 pounds of ammonia due to a leak from the largest high pressure receiver located outside over a 10 minute period (Liquid Spill and Vaporization) inside the facility boundary.

However, industry experts consider the above scenario to be unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n- Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in these vessels;\n- Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of this vessel;\n- A comprehensive preventive maintenance program is in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessel;\n- Emergency response prcedures would enable highly-trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any on-site or off-site condition.\n\nThe hypothetical alternative release scenario for this facility is described as a pipe leak located in the compressor room of the facility.  This model is based upon the release of 626 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period. Using a variety of factors, such as extreme and unlikely weather conditions, ammonia would travel a theoretical distance before dispersing.  Based upon the model, that distance could be up to 0.19 miles.  However, industry experts consider this hypothetical scenario to be unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n- The weather conditions which were used for this scenario are unlikely to occur;\n- Pressure safety valves limit operating pressures;\n- Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of piping;\n- There is a preventative maintenacne program in place to maintain the on-going integrity;\n- Emergency stop buttons are located in areas outside of potential expsoure areas.\n\nContinual Safety Updates\n\nThe facility strives for continual safety improvement.  Some areas of updates in the future shall include continued training for new employees and contractors and working with the Brown County Hazardous Response Team for emergency preparedness purposes (touring the facility and familiarizing themselves with the layout and configuration of the facility and the refrigeration process)."
