In the event of a fire emergency, the Carlyss or Sulphur Fire Departments are directly notified.  This policy is only used when no other emergency assistance (medical, etc.) is required.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe Southern Ionics Incorporated Lake Charles Facility is currently reviewing the Emergency Response Manual for the facility.  Upon completion of plan review, any necessary changes will be made timely.  Southern Ionics recently conducted a review of the Process Hazard Analysis.  No deficiencies were found during the analysis, however, Southern Ionics noted several areas that will be reviewed more closely for potential safety improvements.  Detailed findings of this review are in the Process Hazard Analysis dated April 21, 2004."
