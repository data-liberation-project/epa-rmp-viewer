      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIt is the policy of the City of Bryan, Texas, to operate safe water and wastewater treatment facilities, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with our processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, our employees, and the environment. It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the Well Field Pump Station is municipal drinking water production.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant to ensure a safe drinking water supply.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine: 24,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nFailure of a ton container of  2,000 pounds of chlorine; 10 minute release mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because the process is sheltered by a building.  Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nFailure of a vacuum regulator check unit in the open position.  The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute, and an offsite distance of 0.26 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur.  \nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Well Field Pump Station is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The Well Field Pump Station has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the Rule. As a result of a Hazard Review at this plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \nFive Year Accident Histor"

      "SummaryText": "y\nThe Well Field Pump Station has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe following recommendations were made as a result of the Well Field Pump Station Risk Management Program. Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\n' We will repair all leak detectors along with alarms and SCADA interlocks.  We will ensure maintenance and calibration of leak detectors.\n' We will repair the residual analyzer and link it to our SCADA system\n' We will require each operator to be trained on the plant's  SOP.\n' We will endeavor to develop and implement a chlorine supplier audit program.  For example, do they have emergency container repair kits? Do they maintain their equipment?  \n' We will formalize our Buddy System for hazardous substance work at the plant.  \n' We will train employees recurrently on B-kits and SCBAs.  We will show B-kit videos, & drill annually (with air packs).\n' We will implement a more restrictive access to the facility\n"
