There are a total of four screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads. All four compressors operate on two -25\u00b0F recirculator packages. The compressors have side ports to maintain a +20\u00b0F high side trap.  \n\nThere are three separate suction temperatures two -25\u00b0F low temp. recirculators to maintain freezer rooms and a +20\u00b0F high side trap. The high side trap maintains dock temperatures and sub cools liquid to the low side.\n\nThere are three rooftop mounted evaporative condensers with remote sumps.  Three of the compressors oil is cooled with glycol shell and tube units use for under floor heating.  A Hansen auto-purger is also used to remove non-condensable materials.  A system dump is also incorporated should a need to purge the system arise. \n\n \nProcess Description\n\nLiquid Side\n\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the Condensers.  The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  This condensed liquid leaves Condenser units EC-1 EC-2 and EC-3 via a 3\u00bf inch pipe and flows to the thermosyphon header and the Thermosyphon Receiver (V-1).  \n\nThe  thermosyphon Receiver supplies liquid to the Frick screw compressor for cooling of the oil.  This oil cooler is mounted on the side of the screw compressor unit.  The refrigerant in the oil cooler naturally recirculates to and from the Thermosyphon Receiver when there is a heat load.\n\nThe high-pressure liquid also leaves the thermosyphon receiver via a 3 line and feeds the Hansen auto-purger unit and High-pressure receiver (V-3).  The High Temperature trap is operated at +20\u00b0F.  The liquid supply to V-2 is controlled by a float and solenoid.\n\n   \n\nThe Low Temperature Recirculators are operated at -25\u00b0F.  A float and solenoid device co"

The liquid from the Low Temperature Recirculator is pumped to the -15\u00b0 F freezer air units.  \n\n\n \nVapor Side\n\nThe Compressors remove the vapors from both the High Temperature Recirculator and the Low Temperature Recirculator vessels.  \n\nScrew compressors: C-1 through C-4 remove the vapors from the High Temperature trap through side ports.  Screw Compressor C-1  through C-4 removes vapors from the Low Temperature Recirculator.    \n\nThe discharge of all the compressors, C-1 through C-4, is sent to the main discharge header, which feeds the Condenser units.  The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  \n\nAdditionally, as required, some of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) are diverted for use as a defrosting medium.  This defrost gas is sent to the Air Units   for removal of ice that has built up on the coils.\n\n\n \nDefinitions\n\nThermosyphon System\n\nA thermosyphon system is a means by which an uninterrupted supply of liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the compressor units.  This liquid utilizes a shell and tube or plate heat exchanger to keep the compressor's oil cooled and thus allowing the units to operate at the Manufacturer's recommended temperature.  \n\nLiquid ammonia is supplied to the inlet of the heat exchanger.  When a heat load is applied to the heat exchanger, some of the liquid is vaporized.  This vapor-liquid mixture that is less dense than a pure liquid.  The denser liquid (supply) displaces the lighter vapor-liquid mixture thus pushing the mixture out of the heat exchanger and back to the Thermosyphon Receiver.  This difference in density creates a natural circulation.\n\n\nSingle Stage Compression System\n\nA single stage compressor system utilizes one or more compressors to pump the refrigerant vapor from the low-pressure side to the high-pressure side of the refrigeration system.  Each compressor"

The pumps supply liquid to the various evaporators.  The outlet of the evaporators (consisting of liquid and vapor) is returned to the recirculator vessel for separation of the liquid and vapor.\n\nThe application can be either a low temp or high temp application. The liquid feed can be sub-cooled through an intercooler or fed directly from the receiver."
