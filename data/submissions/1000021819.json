      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is prepared for the Premier DeBeque Gas Plant located at 4344  V 2/10 Road in DeBeque, Colorado, 81630.  The purpose of this RMP is to strive for the prevention of NGL accidental releases from the facility and to reduce the severity of any release which might occur.\n\nAs stipulated to in 29 CFR 1910.119, a process that involves a flammable liquid or gas on site in one location, at or above a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds would require Process Safety Management (PSM).  The Premier DeBeque facility meets the requirements as defined by the US Department of Labor Occupational, Safety, and Health Administration (OSHA) as a PSM facility.  However, the facility is not manned and for the five years prior to the submission of this RMP, the process has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any offsite death, injury, or a response to an environmental receptor.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION / EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe DeBeque Premier Gas Plant is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel and contractors working in the facility, neighbors in the surrounding area, and the environment. This commitment is supported by management as demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, which include, but are not limited to, training and safety in the operation, and maintenance of the plant. The facility implements both administrative and engineering controls to minimize the risk of a release of a flammable substance. \n\nIn addition, while an uncontrolled release is not anticipated, established emergency response policies are designed to minimize impacts on human health and the environment. In the event such a release should occur, the personnel at the plant, in cooperation with local response "

The entire operation is contained within the property boundary and no other companies operate on the property. Thus, by definition, the DPGP is a stationary source.  \n\nThe primary activity at the Premier Gas Plant is the gathering, handling, and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold to a petroleum refiner.  Constituents of NGL include the following listed regulated substances: ethane (CAS# 74-84-0), propane (CAS# 74-98-6), Isobutane (CAS# 75-28-5), and Isopentane (CAS# 78-78-4).\n\nThere are no regulated toxic substances stored at the plant. Operators are knowledgeable as to the activation of the emergency shutdown, which will limit the exposure of any release to the surrounding public.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for each of the constituents have been completed using the Environmental Protection Agency's RMP*Comp, Version 1.07.  The endpoint for the scenario for a vapor cloud explosion type release is 0.2 miles.\n\nEmployees visually inspect the plant each day and provide any necessary maintenance, thereby decreasing the possibility of any release to the outside environment. A preventive maintenance program further reduces the possibility of a release equal to the Worst Case or Alternative Release Scenario. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe DeBeque Premier Gas Plant has both administrative and engineering controls in place to prevent the accidental release of a regulated substance.  The administrative policies include, but are not limited to, initial training and refresher tra"

Engineering controls include, but are not limited to, relief valves, emergency shut off valves, and flow regulators.\n\nIn addition, the plant is regulated by many Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards and Regulations and complies with regulations governed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) including Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), Section 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), and Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure). The Plant also complies with federal Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Regulations and other state regulations which aim to reduce the potential for a release of chemicals to the environment.\n\nThe facility Accident Prevention Program incorporates all of the requirements of Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA's Risk Management Program.  The Accident Prevention Program is used in the identification, evaluation, prevention, or mitigation of chemical releases resulting from a failure in processes, procedures or equipment.\n\nEmployees have received comprehensive training. The training program is on-going, and incorporates information for the handling of on-site, listed RMP chemicals. Employees have received training about the process, including operations and maintenance procedures and safe work practices. \n\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements. These practices include lock-out/tag-out, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work permits to ensure the safe operation of the facility and the protection of employees, contractors, and the surrounding area.\n\n\n \nAn incident investigation will be conducted in the event tha"

The plan details procedures for contacting responders for mitigation of a release of a regulated substance. The plan addresses aspects of emergency response by outside experts, and includes instructions for communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination. In addition, the Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of any emergency response equipment maintained on site, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency protection equipment. Employees receive appropriate training in procedures necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties which includes contacting trained responders. The Emergency Response Plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities within the plant. Changes to the plan include informing and/or training affected personnel of the changes.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAt this time,"
