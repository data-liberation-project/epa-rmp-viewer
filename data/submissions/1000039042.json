ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES: We at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and protection. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this facility. It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If an accidental release were to occur, Brenntag has coordinated emergency response\n\nactivities with the Huntsville Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release. We are also able to employ resources from our Brenntag facility in Chattanooga, TN if necessary.\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: Brenntag's primary activities at this facility encompass chemical warehousing and distribution. Currently, there are two regulated substances present at this facility that exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130. Those subtances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. These regulated subtances are received prepackaged in 2000 pound tons containers and 150 pound cylinders. Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide is only used for resell to our customers. The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 82,745 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous),\n\nis present at our facility in quantities of 10,985 lbs.  3.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are currently in place at this facility.  \n\n\n\na). Process Safety Information: Brenntag maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the regulated chemicals and processes.  \n\n\n\nb). Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's): This facility conducts comprehensive PHA's to ensure that hazards associated with each regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently. What If Techniques are utilized for completion PHA's. The PHA's are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. PHA's are reviewed prior to the implementation of any process change that involves the regulated substance; immediately following an accidental release or if an incident has occurred that could have resulted in an accidental release. At a minimum, PHA's are revalidation every five\n\nyears. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nc). Operating Procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag maintains written operating procedures.
