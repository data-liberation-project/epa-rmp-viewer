Detailed analysis of the potential hazards of the process, comprehensive training of employees, and emphasis on safety will help in avoiding any serious chemical release accidents at the facility.    \n\n5.0\tFive-Year Accident History\nThe Marietta transload facility is anticipated to be commissioned in October 2023.  There have been no releases of butane that resulted in onsite injuries, death or property damage or any offsite impacts, as it is a new facility with no historical hazardous inventory.\n\n6.0\tEmergency Response Program\nThe facility will conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Marietta Fire Department and other coordinating agencies.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n7.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nGiven that this is a prescriptive RMP, as the facility is new and not operational as of this report, planned improvements and safeguards are captured as recommendations in the PHA."
