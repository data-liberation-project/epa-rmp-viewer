Overall responsibility for safety resides with the Plant Manager.  Management is directly involved in the several Teams that oversee the Safety Programs. These Teams are composed of a broad cross section of the employees.\n\nEpsilon maintains a fully staffed Health, Environmental, Safety (HES) department. The HES department oversees the implementation of the company\u00bfs risk management program.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team, consisting of fully trained volunteer members on duty for all shifts.\n \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEpsilon employs approximately 140 people at the Marcus Hook site. These people work in the Tri-State (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware) area with many residing in the Boroughs and Townships surrounding the facility.\n\nThe facility manufactures Polypropylene, one of the most useful of plastics. It is inert, non-toxic, non-hazardous and burns poorly.\n\nPropylene is the major hazardous material on site. It is the chemical, which places Epsilon in the RMP Program. Similar to propane in characteristics, it is flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air. It is handled under pressure in both its gaseous and liquid forms. \n\nOther chemicals on site include:\n- Ethylene, which is a normally gaseous hydrocarbon. It is flammable and potentially explosive when mixed with air.\n- Propane, which is similar to propylene in characteristics.\n- Hydrogen, which is handled in both it\u00bfs gaseous form and as a cryogenic liquid. It is flammable and potentially explosive when mixed with air.\n- Nitrogen, which is handled as a gas and as a cryogenic liquid. It is potentially an asphyxiant and can cause severe frost burns in it\u00bfs liquid form.\n- Catalyst components, which have low toxicity levels.\n- Triethylaluminum (TEA"

The worst case scenario, involving an instantaneous rupture of the largest vessel in the facility, is not considered credible.  The alternative scenario considered, that of a pump seal leak, is considered unlikely, but more realistic, and is used as part of the emergency response planning and training.\n\nEpsilon\u00bfs location, surrounded primarily by other industrial facilities, roads, and railroads, minimizes the likelihood of impacting on residential areas.  The worst case scenario, however, may potentially impact on residential areas to the northeast of the facility.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEpsilon\u00bfs Marcus Hook facility has an active Risk Management/Process Safety Management program.  The program is coordinated by the Manager, Health, Environment, and Safety.  Various elements of the program are delegated to other personnel, who manage their elements under the coordination of the Manager, HES.\n\nThe company involves all employees in appropriate areas of the PSM/RM program such as participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams, management of change (MOC) reviews, incident investigations, etc.  The company also works closely with outside agencies, including involving the outside agencies in company training programs.  Some features of the program include:\n\n- Fully staffed HES department.\n- Fully trained operations and maintenance departments.\n- OSHA PSM/EPA Risk Management Program, including:\n- Employee Participation\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazards Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Personnel training\n- Emergency Response and Planning\n- Incident Investigations\n- Contractor Train"

This incident involved an instrument supervisor being sprayed with propylene and mineral oil during routine maintenance.  There was no offsite impact, or damage to plant equipment.  The person involved was treated for the exposure.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs In Place\n\nThe facility utilizes a number of monitoring, detection, and suppression systems to prevent, detect, and mitigate fires and releases of hazardous materials.  These include:\n\n- Computerized process control / alarm/ interlock shutdown system.\n- Emergency shutdown/kill systems.\n- Gas detectors.\n- Flame detectors.\n- Automatic and manually activated water spray/sprinkler systems\n- Fire extinguishers\n- Centralized alarm system.\n- Fully Trained Emergency Response Team.\n- Communications Systems: Radios, Emergency Phones, PA system, Emergency Call Procedures.\n- Emergency Evacuation Procedures and Drills.\n- Fire Water System: Hydrants, Monitors, Hose Stations, and Backup Firewater system.\n- Diking and Burn Pits for Pyrophoric Liquids.\n\nThe company also actively works with the local emergency planning committee, fire department, police department and other appropriate agencies.
