      "SummaryText": "The Brownwood Wastwater Treatment Plant (WWTP) treats wastewater from residential, commercial and industrial sectors of the City.  Wastewater is processed and treated with gasesous Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide, each of which is feed into the system from one ton containers.\n\nChlorine is stored as a liquid under pressure in the containers, and is supplied to the treatment system as a gas under vacuum.  Four one ton containers located outside under shade cover are connected to the Chlorine feed system.  Chlorine is fed from two containers at a time.  Feed is automatically switched to the second set of containers when the first set is empty.  Up to two additional containers are stored in the covered container storage area.\n\nSulfur Dioxide is also stored under pressure as a liquefied gas in one ton containers and is supplied to the treatment system as a gas under vacuum.\n\nTwo Sulfur Dioxide containers, located outdoors in and enclosed sheet metal storage box, are connected to the feed system.  Gas is fed to the treatment system from one container at a time.  Feed is automatically switched to the remaining container when the first is empty.  Up to two additional full sulfur dioxide containers are stored in covered container storage area.\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are delivered by truck in one ton containers from a regional supplier.  The plant operators use the facility's hoists to remove the containers from the delivery truck and place them on storage racks in each chemical storage area.\n\nAs a measure to protect against the occurrence of accidental chemical releases, periodic reviews are conducted to identify potential hazards associated with the equipment and procedures for the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide system.  Any identified deficiencies, such as potential equipment malfunctions or human errors, must be documented and maintained.  Sets of standared operating procedures (SOP) are in place for proper storage, use, and handling of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide at the W"

Operating procedures are in place to provide clear instructions to safely conduct activities associated with the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide system.\n\nTo protect personal in the operation to the chemical feed systems, adequate training is provided for each employee involved with the process.  Proper operator training is a key element to the operation of the facility in a safe manner.  As part of the training system, refresher and update training are provided on a regular basis.\n\nPreventive maintenance, inspection, and testing of equipment are vital to the proper operation of the facility.  Maintenance procedures are implemented for the equipment associated with each system.  A preventive maintenance schedule has been developed from equipment manufacturer and industry guidelines.  Personnel involved in the on going maintenance are trained in the maintenance procedures and in the hazards of the processes and all maintenance activities are documented for future references.\n\nA system to investigate any accident or near miss involving Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide is in place for each facility.  A report describing the cause and any effects of the incident is made followed by recommendations for corective action.  The purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the cause of the problem, implement a safe solution, and ultimately prevent the situation from occuring again.  Incidents can be reviewed for similarities to determine if a trend is evident, possibly uncovering a previously unidentified root cause.  This provides for continually improving safety at the facility.\n\nIn the event an accidental release does occur at the facility, it is critical to be prepared to respond quickly, safely, and effectively to minimize the effects of the release.  Operators at the plant are qualified to respond to incidental Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide leaks that do not pose an immediate threat to the individual.  The City of Brownwood Fire Department is responsible for responding"

In a emergency situation, protection of personnel at the facility, notifications of emergency responders and evacuation to a safe location are the primary responsibilities of the employees at the plant.\n\nWith continued support from all lveels of personnel, training and preventive maintenance we can make this facility as safe as possible.  In the event an accident does occur all personnel will be trained and ready to take immediate actioin to insure the safety of facility personnel and surronding area."
