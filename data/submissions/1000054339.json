To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\n\n\nThis facility processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) which contain low levels of hydrogen sulfide (less than 10,000 ppm).  High pressure gas from field wells is sent to a gas plant whereby NGL liquids are extracted and stored in two 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks operating at approximately 200 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances specifically methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane and pentane.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss NGL (propane and butane) which is the specific chemical contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.  The facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of the facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP) and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of"
