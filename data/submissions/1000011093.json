      "SummaryText": "Davis Supply is a supplier of water treatment chemicals for small, local, public and private water treatment facilities.  This office/warehouse facility includes a chlorine storage area under roof outside the building structure, which contains 150-pound cylinders of chlorine. A maximum inventory level of 60 cylinders or 9,100 pounds of chlorine gas will be stored on site at any time. Based on the maximum inventory\nlevels, only chlorine is subject to the RMP standard. Public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release. \nWith less than 10 full time employees on site, this facility does not meet the requirements for regulation under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard. This facility therefore qualifies as a Program 2 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.\nCurrently three (3) people are employed by the facility. The facility is generally staffed by 2 people during the normal business hours of 0800 hours to\n1700 hours, Monday through Friday.\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios,identified as worst-case release and alternative release.The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as A?more likely to\noccur than the worst-case release scenario.\n(1.) The worst-case release scenario at the Davis Supply facility involves the release of the contents of a single 150-pound chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes. An offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed based on calculations provided by the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors document. This scenario followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic\nendp"

      "SummaryText": "oint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. These conditions were set by the EPA to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; and the assumptions do not likely reflect realistic results. Public receptors within the area contained in a circle with its center at the Davis Supply facility and outwards at a radius of 0.4\nmiles were noted as follows:\nThe alternative release scenario involves valve failure on a single 150-pound cylinder. From the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release, the release rate for the valve of a 1-ton container of chlorine is 12.7 pounds per minute. The only difference between the valve of a 1-ton container and 150-pound cylinder is the presence of a fusible plug on the 1-ton container. The release rates\ntherefore would be expected to be the same. \nDavis Supply accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\nA? Training of chlorine handlers\nA? Supplier provided cylinder preventive maintenance program\nA? Use of industry standard process and safety equipment\nChlorine-specific prevention steps include:\nA? Training in the practices of safe chlorine handling\nA? The availability of an A-kit on site for any active mitigation to limit a release\nA? Awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\nNo accidental releases of chlorine occurred at this facility.\nEmergency response procedures are coordinated with local emergency responders, as this facility is not capable of emergency response. In the event of an emergency, 911 is contacted and the site is evacuated.\n"
