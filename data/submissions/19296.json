Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of United Suppliers, Inc. (the Facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the site is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. The maximum quantity stored would be 76,500 poinds.\n\n3. Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios: The Worst-Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 mpounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % as limited by design standards. the distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million or ppm) is 2.1 miles. The Alternate Case Scenario based on the five year accidernt history or the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic shut-off valve intervenes and stops the flow. The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the end point of 200 ppm would be 2.1 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administr"

      "SummaryText": "ation (OSHA), 29CFR1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference in Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammkonia\". The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form, Section 8.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility or, to the best of our knowledge, any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has: a written Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR1910.38; provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA) and  pre-emergency planning and employee training.  This facility is inclued in the Hardin County Emergency Response plan.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess  the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
