(OREG4) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility complies with \nnumerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal and Colorado \nprocess safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, \nand local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety \nmanagement plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite \nfor reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed \nto ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak \ndetection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire \ndetection monitors. OREG4 provides high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and \nemergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency \nresponse procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request \ntheir assistance.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\nThe OREG4 power units are fueled by waste heat from a compressor turbine exhaust that is \ntransferred from thermal energy into mechanical energy. This is accomplished by utilizing the \norganic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a \nWaste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat \ntransfer fluid. The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube vaporizer of an Ormat Energy \nConverter (OEC). The motive fluid on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive a special \norganic fluid turbine. This turbine, which rotates at 1800 rpm, drives a generator which produces \ngrid compatible power. The motive f1uid then passes through a heat exchanger and en"

After exiting the various heat exchangers, the thermal oil passes through \nthe thermal oil surge tanks and the thermal oil feed pumps, which discharge it into the WHOH. \nThe power from this project will be sold to Highline Electric Association based in Holyoke, CO.\n\nThe basic Rankine cycle model consists of four components:\n1. Pump -Work Input\n2. Boiler -Heat Input\n3. Turbine -Work Output\n4. Condenser -Heat Rejection\n\nThe Rankine cycle consists of pressurizing a liquid (pentane), vaporizing the high pressure liquid, \nexpanding the high pressure vapor and condensing the low pressure vapor for reuse. The energy \nnecessary for the vaporization is provided by thermal oil at a maximum temperature of 572?F. The \nthermal energy is transferred to the pentane working fluid via tube and counter-current shell heat \nexchangers. The OREG4 facility uses a commercial pentane with a dry cooling heat rejection \nsystem.\n\nPrimary Activities \n\nWaste thermal energy is converted to electric power. The facility is rated at 3700 KW. The net \npower output to the electrical grid is rated at 3200 KW. Power output is reduced in warm weather \ndue to limitations of the air cooled heat exchangers.\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid pentane is pumped \nfrom a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is \ntransferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states \nfrom liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric \npower. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to \ncomplete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is \nsegregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the \npentane conditions in that section. The sections include: the low pre"

The \nnominal maximum liquid inventory exists when the facilities are not operating. At that time the \nenergy in the pentane is reduced and most of the inventory is present as a liquid in the liquid \nrecuperator vessels.
