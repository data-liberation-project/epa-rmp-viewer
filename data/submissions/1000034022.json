If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Oran Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.

In reality the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it was planned. In that event what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals, i.e., anhydrous ammonia, tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Innovative Ag Services is Mark Mienders, location manager.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\r\n\r\nThe system consists of two (2) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump, and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at the site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on this basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company locatio9n is fifteen (15).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K61.1-1989 with amendments and state law.\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Innovative Ag Services Co. has extended to the Oran Fire Department the opportunity to visit our aanhydrous ammonia facilities, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nInnovative Ag Services has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering-in-place.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involv"

In the unlikely event that the Oran Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to the emergency, the fire department(s) with whom Oran Fire Department has mutual aid agreements will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and the Fayette County Emergency Management Agency. Members of the fire department and EMA have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to those entities.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel to the nurse tanks. In so doing they are able to detect problems that are readily visible and easily identifiable before they arise. This routine inspection identifies external portions of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia the company cooperates fully in"
