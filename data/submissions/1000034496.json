(also \"SPS\") stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  SPS has Emergency Response Procedures at the site and in the office, which includes procedures for reporting any hazardous chemical accident or release and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  SPS also has Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures, which is a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as its Emergency Escape Mask  Procedures, which details how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of an accidental  release.  All SPS service vehicles contain Emergency Response Documents, which is a quick reference for employees on what to do in various potential emergency and/or release situations.  SPS also has an emergency action plan contained in section N of the OSHA PSM. \r\n\r\nSPS's Emergency Action Plan is contained within its PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees don safety goggles, gloves and have available escape masks.

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nSPS provides chlorination service to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one-ton containers to twenty pound net capacity service cylinders.  The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools in accordance with the EPA label.  This seasonal facility operates apoximately five days a week (M-F), eight hours per day, from April 1 through October 15 of each year.  \r\n\r\nThe Fill Yard is used for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \r\n\r\nThe chlorine is protected by an 8 foot fenced area with barbed wire, and there is no vehicular traffic inside the storage area. The Fill Yard houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the building.  Signs are posted indicating a restricted area.  Lights are in the fill yard area for safety and to prevent vandalism. Container handling and storage is per local, state and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months, for obvious reasons, are the busiest swim times of the year.  Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. SPS stores a maximum of 10,000 pounds of chlorine.  This amount includes the contents of 3 one-ton containers, 100 max twenty-pound cylinders, and the (1) one-ton container in the repackaging process.   The Federal threshold of 2,500 pounds is exceeded as the maximum on site at any given time is 10,000 pounds of chlorine.\r\n\r\nChlorine is purchased from and delive"

The one-ton containers, up to a maximum of 4, are stored and/or used in the Fill Yard.\r\n\r\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist or a lift gate.  The one-ton containers are placed on rails in the Fill Yard.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location and chocked to prevent movement.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and stored in an upright position in a specially designated cylinder storage area inside the fenced-in Fill Yard.  The company has administrative procedures in place that limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 4 one-ton containers and 100 each twenty pound cylinders for a total of 10,000  maximum pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine in small diameter, short length piping is directed into a liquid caustic absorption scrubber.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in accordance with the maintenance procedures in the PSM.  \r\n\r\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.

Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, the cylinder valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.  After filling, which is indicated by weight on the pan scale reaching the desired value, the cylinder valve is closed, the ton supply of chlorine is closed, and the transfer tubing is evacuated into the chlorine absorption system prior to disconnecting the full service cylinder.  The caustic solution comprising the absorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system using the unique design of the proprietary and confidential chlorine packaging system.\r\n\r\nThe packaging system is operated under pressure from the chlorine container.  Only a small amount of residual chlorine remains in the lines after fill to be routed to the caustic scrubber.  Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the scrubber system is operating correctly.  Chlorine is not vented to the atmosphere.  Full twenty pound cylinders are stored in the packaging area until loaded onto delivery trucks.  Transport and loading of the cylinders adheres to DOT and other regulations.\r\n\r\nFilling is done by trained, qualified personnel.  Written filling procedures exist and are followed.  The entire system is evacuated and the one-ton container liquid valve is shut during non-working hours.

There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitment to an accidental release prevention program. \r\n\r\nSPS conducts hydrostatic testing of all small service cylinders every five (5) years. SPS also has a maintenance program for equipment, including pH testing of caustic in the absorption scrubber, and rebuilding and/or replacing the valves on the fill system. Equipment is continuously inspected for maintenance and upkeep.  The specific safe work processin place at SPS's facility are detailed in the PSM.  \r\n\r\n5.  Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\r\n\r\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacutate the facility and await the arrival of local emergency responders at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.
