The ERP defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The Plan includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release. \nThe ERP addresses all aspects of emergency response including notifying facility personnel, emergency response personnel, Brooke County EMA and local Rescue and Fire Departments.  \nAll employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures. The most recent review of the ERP was done on April 6, 2022.\nOn May 12, 2009, Senate Bill 279, entitled Emergency Response Regulations, more commonly known as the Fifteen Minute Rule was signed into law. The bill amends the Code of West Virginia, Chapter 131, adding new provisions that will require RMP subject industrial facilities (among others) to provide certain information to state and local emergency responders within 15 minutes of an accident or emergency. Local emergency responders must be provided information related to public health, safety and welfare regarding hazardous waste or material releases.\n\nG.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nThe Conley Station is committed to continuously improve the safe handling of the flammable mixtures in the process by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the"

In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n- Hot Work Permit - Hot work permits for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process will be issued by facility safety leaders. The permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed. The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\n- Contractors - Blue Racer hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Before any contractors are allowed to work on the Conley Station, they undergo an orientation conducted by the PSM team. During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances, the safe work procedures insisted on by Blue Racer, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out procedures used at the Conley Station. Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and this information includes evacuation\nroutes and assembly points.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n- Compliance Audits - Regularly scheduled audits will be conducted to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and conducted at least once every three years. Audit findings will be documented in a report and corrective actions required from the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner and documented.\n\n- Incident Investigation - Any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance will be promptly investigated.

Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees. \n\n- Training - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on the predominant regulated flammable component of the mixture, which in this case is butane. Meteorological conditions for worst-case scenarios are defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h).\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved a release of 115,648 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.4 miles to the 1 psi endpoint.  \n\nb.\tAlternative Case scenarios:\nTwo alternative-case scenarios were evaluated.  The first scenario was considered the potential loading hose (due to sudden uncoupling) failure from the loading area resulting in vapor cloud explosion. This scenario was considered more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  The internal diameter (ID) of the hose was estimated at 2 inches. The release rate of 3,190 lb/min for the selected chemical (propane) was calculated using RMPComp&trade;.   RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.2 miles to 1 psi overpressure endpoint resulting from a vapor cloud explosion with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77\u00b0F).\nThe second alternative scenario was a 1 inch hole or puncture on the vessel V 1950 resulting in vapor cloud fire. Since butane and propane have the same LFL (36 mg/L), butane, the selection of the chemical was based on the predominant regulated component of the mixture. Thus butane was the chemical used for this scenario.  RMP Comp &trade; was used to predict a distance of 0.1 miles to LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77\u00b0F).
