A knowledgeable audit team carefully reviews facility\r\npractices and documents findings for management's review and\r\nimplementation.    Resulting    corrective    actions    are\r\nelectronically tracked until completion.

Over the past 5 years, only\r\none RMP incident has occurred. While this incident, in April\r\n2001, resulted in onsite property damage, the equipment  has\r\nbeen repaired, and in some instances, upgraded. The incident\r\nreleased smoke, containing hydrocarbons, and the company has\r\nreceived  numerous  lawsuits.  All incidents  of  any  kind,\r\nincluding   near  misses,  that  have  occurred  have   been\r\ncarefully investigated and critiqued to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe  Los  Angeles  Refinery maintains  a  written  emergency\r\nresponse  program  that is in place to  protect  worker  and\r\npublic  safety  as well as the process and the  environment.\r\nThe  program  consists of procedures  for  responding  to  a\r\nrelease  of a regulated substance, including the possibility\r\nof   a  fire  or  explosion  if  a  flammable  substance  is\r\naccidentally  released.  The procedures address  aspects  of\r\nemergency  response, including proper first-aid and  medical\r\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for\r\npersonnel  after  an  evacuation,  notification   of   local\r\nemergency  response agencies, the public, and post  incident\r\ncleanup  and  decontamination procedures. In  addition,  the\r\nrefinery    has   procedures   that   address   maintenance,\r\ninspection,   testing,   and  use  of   emergency   response\r\nequipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to\r\nperform  specific emergency response duties.  The  emergency\r\nresponse  program  is  up"
