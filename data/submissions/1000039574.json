Engineering and technical upgrades and improvements also impact sound and reliable systems.  Censors, alarm systems, and varying levels of human monitoring provide ongoing prevention and early detection.  Internal/ external audits, inspections and record keeping are active systems for evaluation - revealing gaps and determining areas for improvement.\r\n\r\nEmergency action plans, hazard communications, and emergency evacuation programs address awareness, alarms and the safe response of employees to potential leaks.  Evacuation drills, response drills and involvement with the Fulton Fire Department, the Oswego County Hazardous Materials team,  furthers our ability to respond and effectively contain and mitigate potential releases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe K&N's Foods USA plant in Fulton, NY is a further processing plant for poultry products that includes cold storage warehouse for shipping and receiving materials.

These items are made, and flash frozen at this facility.  \r\n\r\nRefrigeration is required to maintain a high quality product during the process and packaging operations.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at quantities above the reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant of choice for several reasons:  It is economical and efficient to use, and it provides low operating temperatures that are needed for rapid freezing of the product.  \r\n\r\nSafety programs and procedures have been developed in an effort to reduce the risk of possible releases to the environment.  Compliance to environmental responsibilities is achieved by the assignment of responsibilities to the plant management staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe K&N's Foods USA facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  As such, the plant resides within the Prevention Program for Program 3 Processes of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\nEach of the PSM components are followed and used toward safeguarding and prevention.  Levels and releases of all types are documented and evaluated for future prevention.  When practicable, engineering enhancements are made as equipment is restored or new equipment is put in place. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the event an ammonia event occurs, the evacuation plans are followed, and the Fulton Fire Department is contacted. The Fulton Fire Department would notify the Oswego County Hazardous Materials Team for any situations requiring further assistance."
