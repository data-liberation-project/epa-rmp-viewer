      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the Jefferson County Environmental Services Department's (JCESD) policy to operate safe wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the necessary treatment processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Valley Creek WWTP.  It is JCESD's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws applicable to the Valley Creek WWTP.  Although not required by regulation, the JCESD has installed a chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubber to reduce the risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment at the Valley Creek WWTP in the event of a release.  \n\nDescription of Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled\nValley Creek WWTP is a publicly owned and operated wastewater treatment plant.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used primarily for disinfection and dechlorination, respectively.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling biosolids in the clarification process.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is 60,000 pounds (30 one-ton containers).  The chlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, evaporator, automatic switchover system, chlorine gas dispensers, chlorine leak detectors, alarms, a chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubber, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorinating the effluent before it is discharged into the Valley Creek WWTP.  The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide that can be stored at the facility is 40,000 pounds (20 one-ton containers).  The dechlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, evaporator, automatic switchover sy"

The total volume of digester gas that can be stored in the storage sphere and all digesters is estimated at 225,936 cubic feet (ft3), and the corresponding weight is estimated at 30,100 pounds.  The digester gas generated by the facility is used as a fuel for engines that produce hot compressed air that is used for sludge mixing in the digesters.  Water is pumped in a loop through the engines to capture the heat generated by the engine.  Some of the hot water is used to heat the sludge in the digester and to heat the building.  The digester gas system consists of hot water supply and return headers, gas engine blowers, digester gas purifier, recirculation compressors, digester gas sediment and drip traps, combination pressure/vacuum relief valve and flame arresters, flame traps, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment. \n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case scenario for toxics is the failure of one liquid sulfur dioxide container resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in 10 minutes.  Because the containers are stored in an enclosed building, the actual release rate is 55 percent of the total sulfur dioxide released due to passive mitigation .  The release rate of 0.83 kg/s is modeled using DEGADIS 2.1.  Under the worst-case weather conditions prescribed by the RMP Rule, the distance to a toxic endpoint of 3 ppm is 1.68 miles, beyond which there will be enough dispersion to reduce the concentration below the toxic endpoint.

The estimated worst-case release quantity of digester gas is 21,444 pounds.  No passive mitigation is considered because the storage sphere is not enclosed.  On the basis of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the distance to the flammable endpoint distance of 1.0 psi overpressure is estimated to be 0.18 mile, beyond which there will be no overpressure to cause damage to buildings and population.  The total population within the flammable endpoint circle is estimated to be 90 persons based on 1990 Census Data.\n\nThe chlorine alternative release scenario (ARS) is the release of liquid chlorine from a <-inch-diameter pipe connecting the chlorine container to the feed manifold.  This scenario is more likely to happen when the evaporator in the chlorination system is in service.  For a release duration of 22 minutes, the release rate is 1.56 kg/s.
