PMC (Plains Midstream Canada) management goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Schaefferstown Facility is one of many facilities owned and operated by PMC.  At the facility, we receive propane via pipeline and tanker trucks.  The received propane is dehydrated and stored in pressure vessels.  From these pressure vessels, propane can be loaded directly into tanker trucks for distribution or sent to cryogenic storage tanks for storage.  For cryogenic storage, propane is cooled in a refrigeration system and sent to two cryogenic tanks for storage at -44 degrees F and less than 18 inches of water column.\n\nPropane and ethyl mercaptan are the only flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Schaefferstown Facility in amounts above threshold quantity. There are no toxic substances present at the site. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by PAALP.

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nA?Emergency shutdown devices at thirteen locations throughout the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\nA?Minimizing the possibility of overfilling by having high and high high level alarms on all our storage tanks and bullets.\nA?Providing a fire water system at the facility, which is designed to cool the tanks in the event of a fire.\nA?A hydrocarbon gas detection system consisting of 48 gas detectors located throughout the facility.  The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm at low gas concentrations and will trigger emergency shutdown system at high gas concentrations.\nA?A fire detection system consisting of six fire-eyes, which will trigger emergency shutdown system when activated.\nA?Reverse check valves on hot bullets to minimize the possibility of overfilling and excess flow valves to stop flow in the event of a pipeline rupture or break.\nA?Having an emergency generator at the facility in order to operate the process control sy"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Lebanon County Police Department, the Lebanon County Emergency Management Agency, and the Lebanon County Emergency Medical Services and, as appropriate, the Pennsylvania State Highway Patrol, the Texas Eastern Pipeline, and the Buckeye Pipeline.  The Schaefferstown Facility Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\nA?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\nA?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\nA?The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an i"
