Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail facility acts as the stationary source for regulated substance anhydrous ammonia which is used as a refrigerant in their produce processing operations. These operations include produce pre-cooling and vacuum cooling, refrigerated warehousing, and chilling of process water. To see a location map and site plan of the stationary source, refer to sheet T0.0 in RMP Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1.\n\nThe refrigeration mechanical room and roof houses screw compressors, pressure vessels, and the evaporative condensers that serve as the high-side for both the fixed system cold room fan coils, and the portab"

Electrical services and control are provided in the Engine Room and Electrical Room. Vacuum tubes are moved to the Taylor Farms Retail Yuma, AZ facility during the company's winter operation between November and April.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for this system is shown in RMP Binder Chapter 8. The total refrigeration charge of approximately 42,000 lb. is completely sealed and pressurized within the system.\n\nA list of refrigeration equipment presently used at this facility can be found in the schedules located in RMP Binder Chapter 12 Appendix 12.1. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in RMP Binder Chapter 12 Appendix 12.2, describe equipment details. The drawings in RMP Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 show the refrigeration equipment layout.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See RMP Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4. for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTaylor Farms Retail maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for wa"

      "SummaryText": "ys to prevent a similar future release, see RMP Binder Appendix 16-Incident Investigation.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere was no accidental releases of regulated substance anhydrous ammonia from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Other than this, there was only one incident, accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, at the facility in the past five years, which did not meet the five-year accident history reporting criteria. The incident occurred on 7-28-2019. The incident took place while the relief valves were being replaced on the T-090 recirculator package, which was located outdoors. An incident investigation was started on the same day. Incident investigation report was prepared as a result of the investigation. There was no injury, death, or property damage on-site or off-site. Facility Manager invoked the facility emergency plan including shutting off the liquid supply from the engine room to the system and instructed evacuation of both facility buildings.

Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in RMP Binder Appendix 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."
