MSDS/SDSs contain information concerning both the physical properties and the hazards associated with each chemical.  This information typically includes (1) toxicity information, (2) physical data, (3) reactivity and corrosivity  data, (4) thermal and chemical stability data and (5) hazards of mixing substances together.  MSDS/SDSs are available to all employees as well as the emergency responders in our community.  MSDS/SDSs for all Smyrna materials are maintained on site. Manufacturing instruction described on the product batch sheet are followed closely to ensure the finished product is made safely and meets strict quality criteria.\n\n\n\n    Important process parameters are also documented and maintained.  Engineering design documents may include (1) operating limits, (2) block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, (3) process chemistry, (4) maximum intended inventories, (5) design basis and configuration, (6) piping and instrumentation diagrams and (7) other information that is important for understanding the design intent, operating limits and hazards of each process.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSES\n\n\n\n    The Smyrna plant has a comprehensive program for ensuring that the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled.

A team comprising personnel with engineering, operations, environmental and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved and prioritized by management and tracked until they are implemented.  We update and re-validate each PHA every five years or whenever a significant change is made.  The results and findings from these re-validation studies are documented and retained and recommendations are tracked by management until resolved or completed.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\n    Our engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial start-up of a new or improved process.  Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.

Audits are performed by an EHS team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved. \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n    The prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error.  In addition to the prevention program, the Smyrna plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public and the environment.  These features may contain or control a release, detect a release or reduce the consequences of a release.  They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility:\n\n-    Release detection monitors\n\n-    Procedures require that a plan employee be present during loading and unloading operations\n\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n-    Automated notification systems for some process parameters, (e.g., high level, high pressure)\n\n-    Manual shutdown systems located in the control room\n\n-    Diked areas designed to contain a release and prevent its spread\n\n-    Pressure relief valves and rupture disks that discharge safely to the atmosphere\n\n-    Fire/Vapor suppression equipment\n\n-    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)- protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus\n\n-    Spill clean up equipment\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n    There has been no major spill or release of formaldehyde from our facility in the last five years.\n\n\n\n    For any incidents that occur, we complete a non conformance notification (NCN) to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.  The following list describes some of the improvements made as a result of these investigations:\n\n-    Tank level alarms and gauges\n\n-    Implemented a Mechanical Integrity program\n\n-    Upgraded secondary containment\n\n-    Implemented a scrubber system check list\n\n-    Installed perimeter monitoring devices\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\n    The Smyrna plant maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public and the environment.  This plan includes personnel safety , evacuation plans and community emergency response notification procedures. The emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders (e.g., the fire department).  This includes periodic meetings with community responders so that they are aware of the hazards of our processes.   This coordination and communication ensures that the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and that action is promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release.  \n\n"
