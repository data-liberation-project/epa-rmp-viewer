We're creating a new kind of food company, one that can shape and define the future of food. We've already helped create some of the biggest consumer trends in food.\n\n\n\nThe WhiteWave facility utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to maintain the ammonia refrigeration system.  The system is checked on a daily basis by both the in-house maintenance mechanics and the refrigeration contractor to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to either shelter in place or to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders and the facility's professional refrigeration service firm are called to assist with the ammonia leak. \n\n\n\nThe management at WhiteWave is committed to safety.  The emergency action plan is incorporated into the One Plan which provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe WhiteWave facility anticipates to complete the modifications to the ammonia system by January 2014.  The facility is located at 18275 Arenth Ave., in City of Industry, California.  The facility is approximately 0.66 miles north of Highway 60 and 4.1 miles west of Highway 57.

The majority of the system is located in and around the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The Evaporative Condensers are mounted on the roof. The evaporators are located in penthouses and the warehouse area.\n\n\n\nA refrigeration system is used to reduce the temperature of a heat source.  A mechanical refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. As the refrigerant absorbs large amounts of heat from the source, the refrigerant changes from liquid to gas.  At a different part of the system, the refrigerant releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.  This system is referred to as having two sides: a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.  The system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side.  Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods or processes can be chilled or frozen. \n\n\n\nThe low side of the refrigeration system typically uses one or more evaporators to remove heat from the space or products to be cooled.  An evaporator contains a set of continuous coils through which the refrigerant flows.  Due to the low pressures and corresponding low temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant quickly evaporates, absorbing a great deal of heat from the surrounding area.  To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe low and high sides of the refrigeration system are separated by the compressor and the expansion valve.  The compressor is the driving force of the system.  It pulls refrigerant vapor from the evaporator (low side) at a rate that will maintain the e"

      "SummaryText": "vaporator pressure required for the desired operating temperature.  At the same time it pressurizes the warm vapor and forces it into the condenser and the high side of the system.  Refrigeration compressors on the market today are screw type, reciprocating, and centrifugal.  \n\n\n\nExpansion valves regulate the flow of liquid refrigerant from the high side to the low side by causing a large pressure drop.  These valves are located between the receiver (high side) and the evaporator (low side).  These valves, coupled with the capacities of the compressor, can help regulate the pressure of the evaporator thereby creating the cooling capabilities of the system.  The high side of the refrigeration system consists of a condenser and a receiver.  Warm refrigerant vapor enters the condenser after it has been pressurized by the compressor.  A condenser will typically use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser.  As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from this vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the receiver.  The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side.  It also serves to hold the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not in operation. \n\n\n\nThe system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensibles, i.e. air, from the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe WhiteWave facility's ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.

These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room and automatic shut down systems.  The facility is in the process of installing additional ammonia sensors in the Glycol Room, penthouses, and the warehouse.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room, glycol room, on the roof, and just outside of the engine room (Recirculator RC-1).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, WhiteWave has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n- On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (June 27 & 28, 2013) revealed that there have been no ammonia releases over the past five years (June 2008 to June 2013) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.  To save lives.\n\n2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.  To protect the environment.\n\n4.  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the WhiteWave facility will evacuate all employees and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  WhiteWave plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.
