We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  \n\nThis facility complies with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements for unloading, transfer, and storage of mixed waste acids and waste nitric acid.  It is our policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency involving waste acid were to occur, it is our policy to respond to the emergency with our trained employees.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00b7 A description of our facility and processing of mixed waste acid (including hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid,  and nitric acid), substances regulated by the U.S. EPA's RMP regulation;\n\n\u00b7 A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental releases of waste acid;\n\n\u00b7 An overview of our Procedures to Prevent Hazards;\n\n\u00b7 A five-year accident history for accidental releases of waste acid;\n\n\u00b7 An overview of our Contingency Plan; and\n\n\u00b7 An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental releases of waste acid from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility is a RCRA-permitted treatment, storage, and disposal facility.  We neutralize mixed waste acids in the aqueous treatment system at the facility.  The waste acid unloading, transfer, and storage system consists of one 5,000-gallon tanker, four 29,395-gallon storage tanks (Tan"

Therefore, the maximum potential amount of waste acid stored in one tank is about 29,395 gal x 10 lb/gal x 90% = 265,000 pounds. \n\nOur procedures to prevent hazards and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment from handling waste acid.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of a 29,395-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (90%), resulting in a release to the containment dike. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is failure of the transfer piping when unloading a tanker truck, resulting in a 350-gallon release to the containment dike.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to endpoint.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our Contingency Plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of waste acid.  \n\nThis facility complies with the U.S. EPA's accident prevention rule and applicable state and local codes and regulations. The waste acid unloading, transfer, and storage system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with federal and state regulations.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWe have never had an accident involving waste acid that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our waste acid unloading, transfer, and storage"
