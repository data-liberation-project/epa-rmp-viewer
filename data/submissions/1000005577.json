Amway Corporation restructured internally in order to better manage its resources.  Amway Corporation has been renamed and divided into several business units under one parent company.  The parent company is Alticor, Inc.  Its manufacturing & distribution business unit, Access Business Group, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alticor, Inc.\n\nSince the manufacturing plants and distribution fall under Access Business Group, LLC  this submission is now under this name.\n\nAccess Business Group, LLC has a manufacturing facility located in Ada, Michigan in with primary activities at the site include the manufacture of home and personal care products.  One process at the Site is covered by EPAA?s Risk Management Program Rule.  That process is the manufacture of aerosol products, including the storage of flammable Liquefied Petroleum Gas propellants.  Aerosol products use these propellants in their pure form or in blends made of various percentages of the base propellants based on the performance requirements of the product.  The regulated substances used in this process are Isobutane; Difluoroethane, Propane, and n-Butane.  The maximum quantities stored, are based on the quantity that could be stored in the base propellant storage tanks plus the maximum anticipated quantity that could be held in the blend storage tanks.  Maximum anticipated quantity of regulated substances on hand are; Isobutane (87,500 pounds); Difluoroethane (91,000 pounds); Propane (68,000 pounds); n-Butane (53,000 pounds).  Worst case and alternate case scenario calculations are based on a release of material from the storage tank with the largest capacity.\n\nThe propellant process is covered under OSHAA?s Process Safety Management Standard and is also regulated by EPAA?s Risk Management Program Rule, Subpart D A? Accidental Release Prevention Program 3.  It is Access Business Group Ada Site p"
