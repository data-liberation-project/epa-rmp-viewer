Most of these gases are repackaged from storage vessels into tube trailers, and/or smaller containers. There are six products at this location which fall under th risk mangement plan requirements. These products are methyl chloride,ethyl chloride, anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, methane and ethylene.The toxic and flammable characteristics of these products makes it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling the two products. These products are six different processes, yet the safe prevention practices are similar in nature. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations. It is our policy to adhere to all applicablefederal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manneer in which we handle and repackage these gases combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided to all personnel responsible for the use of the systems. At this industrial gas distribution facility, ammonia tanker trucks are parked at this facility after their deliveries as a storage site for the tracter-trailer trucks.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle Ammonia combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance and storage procedures provided to all personnel responsible for the use of this system. The primary purpose of this facility is the park and storage of tanker trucks and distribute ammonia to the customer base.\n\nEmployees conduct proper start-up procedures for these processes. The ammonia system must start with the proper setting and securing of the ammonia trailer utilizing wheel chocks, warning signs, and grounding equipment. Once this is accomplished, they can hook-u"

This facility has a Process Safety Management plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program requirements. They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication Program, Confined Space Program (if ever needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases for this facility.\n\nThe emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc., the Harris County-South Houston LEPC , and the Houston Fire Department. If a release were to occur at this location, employees would be notified of the release. Facilities Manager, Chris Porter, will get personnel organized for an emergency action and possible evacuation , If the operator of the system in question tried to mitigate the release using manual valves, the emergency electrical shutoff switch will be utilized to turn off all electricity to the pumps and components of the systems to prevent any further operation of pumping equipment. If the release cannot be stopped, notification to the Houston Fire Deparment via 911 call will be made. The Houston Fire Department will respond to a release at this location, and are trained in HazMat operations. This 911 call will also notify the Houston LEPC so that notification, and if needed, evacuation of the affected area can begin.\n\nThis facility has a toxic and flamm"

This release, if the trailer were full, would have a release of 140,000 pounds of ammonia. Active mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves, and manual shutoffs. Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. The distance to endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the worst case scenario is 4.4 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered urban (Industrial). This release scenario could impact approximately 130,000 persons in a 61 square mile radius. This information was determined using RMP Comp, and Landview III software.\n\nAn alternate toxic release for this location would be the most probable release; a transfer hose leak. The transfer hoses at this location are high pressure stainless steel. Over time, the hoses begin to get crimps, which could lead to a small hole in the transfer hose. If this were to happen with the ammonia, an estimated release rate would be approximately 1 pound per minute for 10 minutes. This 10 pound release would have a toxic distance to endpoint for .14 mg/l of less than 0.1 miles. Within this small area there would be approximately 0 persons affected. There are no residences in this area so the numbers would be the surrounding office/manufacturing facilities.\n\nThere has been an accidental release from this facility in the past five years."
