We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We have implemented a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care( requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public and the environment. Union Carbide management is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\n2.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility is located at 19500 Mariner Avenue in the City of Torrance, California.  The Union Carbide Torrance Terminal activities include the bulk storage, transfer and blending of chemicals. Tank cars are temporarily stationed on-site for the unloading of bulk chemicals.  The Torrance Terminal is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of a regulated substance listed in the RMP rule.  Currently, the only regulated substance present on-site in quantities above the threshold limit is vinyl acetate monomer (VAM).\n\nAnnual VAM throughput is approximately 43 million pounds.  VAM is received by tank rail cars and stored in one aboveground tank dedicated for storage of VAM."

      "SummaryText": "are used in this analysis:\n\nInventory Restriction:   Written operating procedures, which include an operating checklist, limit the maximum filling capacity of the VAM storage tank to 186,000 gallons, approximately 70%.  This tank is equipped with an automatic in-tank float gauge, which is read daily by an operator.  At this fill capacity, procedures require operations to stop all transfers into the tank.  \n\nConcrete Dike:  The dike contains and minimizes VAM evaporation to the atmosphere.\n\nSpecific systems to prevent this scenario from occurring, as well as mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n\nReaction Prevention:  Systems in place to ensure reactivity of material stored in tanks is inhibited.\n\nPressure Relief Systems:  Pressure relief systems help to ensure that over-pressures within tanks are mitigated.\n\nEquipment Design and Construction:  Design and construction codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n\nAlternative-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for VAM is a leaking valve, which is located in the dike area of the VAM storage tank.  The maximum offloading rate is 250 gallons per minute (1,943 pounds per minute) based on simultaneous offloading of two railcars.  This scenario leads to a 19,430-pound release of VAM in 10 minutes, the maximum time it may take an operator shut down the transfer pump.  The scenario assumes that the release is contained in the tank's dike area, which mitigates the release.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) model, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n\nEmergency Shutdown Systems:  A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shut down the transfer pump.  \n\nSurveillance:  Operations personnel routinely monitor the process and facility perimeters.\n\n4.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nUnion Carbide maintains written procedures that provide detail on how to safely operate a process, including various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained up-to-date by revising them as necessary.\n\nIn addition, the plant maintains specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely.  The plant also trains persons who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipment.\n\nOperational Safety Program\n\nUnion Carbide has a comprehensive program to ensure that all the elements listed within this accidental release prevention program are implemented at every Union Carbide location.  This Program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements.\n\nOperational Safety Standards\n\nDesign requirements for active and passive mitigation controls used to prevent major process hazards are documented in operational safety standards.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nUnion Carbide conducts reviews just prior to startup to ensure that new and modified facilities and processes are safe for operation. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nUnion Carbide has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and cont"

Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) if needed to prevent their occurrence.\n\nUnion Carbide primarily uses the What-If/Checklist analysis as well as Fault Tree Analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. These analyses are recognized as some of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUnion Carbide keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date and available to operating personnel. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure and level control) in the Operational Safety Standard (OSS) documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, automated operating systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a means for establishing inspection and maintenance activities. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nUnion Carbide has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ens"

      "SummaryText": "The tank description is summarized below:\n\n* Internal floating roof tank with primary and secondary rim seals;\n* 265,000-gallon capacity and 186,000-gallon maximum operating capacity;\n* Secondary containment with over 350,000-gallon capacity; and\n* Floating gauge for measuring liquid level.\n\nVAM is transferred via pipeline to the adjacent UCAR( Emulsion Systems (UES) latex manufacturing plant as needed or is shipped to customers via tank trucks.  Trucks are vented to a scrubber during loading to control the release of vapors.  If VAM is loaded directly from rail cars to trucks, a dedicated vapor balance system is used to reduce emissions to the atmosphere.\n\nA network of product transfer piping is routed between the VAM storage tank, the truck loading station and the adjacent UES latex plant.  All piping is coated to prevent corrosion and is supported by steel framework, which is securely fastened to concrete or asphalt platforms or foundations.  Underground sections of piping are encased by an outer pipe to prevent corrosion due to contact with soils.\n\n3.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that information be provided about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for VAM included an instantaneous release of all the contents of the VAM storage tank into the 93-foot by 98-foot by 5-foot concrete dike area, which acts as passive mitigation for the release.  This release translates to a release of 186,000 gallons (1,445,220 pounds) based on the maximum safe fill capacity.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) model, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following administrative control and passive mitigation measure"

In addition, employees participate in keeping process safety information up to date by making periodic inspections, having an active role in writing operating procedures and being involved in many other aspects of the accident prevention program, such as incident investigations.\n\nEpisodic Risk Management System\n\nPeriodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.  These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\n\nEquipment Design\n\nVessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nUnion Carbide promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident by reviewing facts and developing corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. \n\nManagement of Change\n\nUnion Carbide has a comprehensive system to ensure that modified facilities and processes will be safe to operate. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUnion Carbide has well-established practices and procedures to maintain tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and transfer hoses, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying"
