These provisions, promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), apply directly to an Anhydrous Ammonia System that is owned, operated and maintained by Ontelaunee Energy Center in Reading, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nOntelaunee Energy Center has a comprehensive accidental release prevention and emergency response program for the Anhydrous Ammonia System.  The program consists of engineering controls, written policies, process safety information documents, operation and maintenance manuals, and other supporting documentation.  This program is consistent with the facility's general commitment to public safety and complies in full with EPA's Chemical Accident Provisions at 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.  Prior to commencement of operations in 2002, Ontelaunee Energy Center established a set of formal, written policies to meet the requirements of EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions regulations, (often referred to as \"RMP regulations\" by Ontelaunee Energy Center employees).  These policies also meet the requirements of similar Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations set forth by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\nThe facility's integrated RMP/PSM Policies' are intended to protect the environment in accordance with EPA regulations and provide protection of employees in accordance with OSHA regulations.  For each program element, there is a statement of facility policy, references to locations of documentation showing compliance with the policy, and references to the specific regulations that apply to the policy.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains the integrated RMP/PSM Policies and supporting documentation in a set of clearly labeled document binders.  The binders are on-file in the facility's document c"

Ontelaunee Energy Center is a combined-cycle electric generation plant that uses gas-fired combustion turbines to make electric power.  The facility produces enough electricity to meet the needs of more than 500,000 homes throughout the region.  \n\n\n\nNitrogen oxides are a by-product of the turbines' combustion process.  Ontelaunee Energy Center's air permit limits the amount of nitrogen oxide that the plant can emit into the air.  The facility uses an Anhydrous Ammonia System to control these emissions.  The system works as follows. \n\n\n\nSpecialized tanker trucks bring anhydrous ammonia onsite, where it is transferred to two 1,600 cubic foot tanks and stored as a pressurized liquid.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the tanks through a sealed system and into a selective catalytic reduction system, where it is injected into the exhaust stream of the facility's combustion turbines.  There, nitrogen oxides in the exhaust react with the ammonia to create harmless nitrogen and water.  \n\n\n\nCollectively, the ammonia storage system and the selective catalytic reduction system constitute the Anhydrous Ammonia System.  The Anhydrous Ammonia System enables the facility to meet EPA's Lowest Achievable Emission Rate for nitrogen oxides.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.  Ontelaunee Energy Center has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program for the Anhydrous Ammonia System.  The Anhydrous Ammonia System has a number of engineering controls to prevent accidental releases.  Multiple, redundant monitors of system temperature, pressure, and flow will automatically notify the control operators before a problem occurs.  Fail-safe interlocks can shut the system down without human intervention.  Multiple ammonia detectors can quickly detect a release and automatically trigger a water deluge system to knock d"

The facility has been designed for safety, and uses best industry practices for the safe unloading, storage and use of ammonia.   \n\n\n\nIn addition to engineering controls, the program includes a wide array of administrative controls to ensure that the Anhydrous Ammonia System is properly operated and maintained.  As noted above, the administrative controls include written RMP/PSM policies.  The administrative controls also include a detailed analysis of process hazards, written operating procedures, employee training, contractor training, contractor evaluation procedures, management-of-change procedures, regular mechanical integrity inspections and compliance audits.  \n\n\n\nPreventive and corrective maintenance activities on the Anhydrous Ammonia System are planned, scheduled, assigned and documented using a computerized maintenance management information system known as Maximo.  This work management tool provides documented evidence that the requirements of the management of change and mechanical integrity programs are implemented in full.  In addition, Maximo is used for procuring and tracking replacement parts for the Anhydrous Ammonia System, and this ensures that proper parts are ordered, received and kept in stock.\n\n\n\nAll tests and inspections on the Anhydrous Ammonia System are scheduled consistent with manufacturers' recommendations.  To the extent that inspections reveal wear and tear, best efforts are made to replace parts in-kind.  If this is not possible, then the management of change procedures ensure that (1) any changes in equipment are consistent with good engineering practice, (2) process safety information is updated accordingly, (3) all operations and maintenance procedures are edited as required, and (4) all affected personnel are notified of the change and receive proper training.\n\n \n\nAdditional controls are provided by a rigorous lockout/tagout program, confined space procedures, hot work procedures, hazardous work permits, fi"

The Anhydrous Ammonia System at Ontelaunee Energy Center commenced operations in July 2002.  There have not been any reportable incidents to date.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program.  Ontelaunee Energy Center has a three-part emergency response program, consisting of  (1) SA-400 One Plan Emergency Response Procedures,  (2) Emergency Response Plan for Employees and On Call Managers, and  (3) Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe SA-400 document provides separate sets of procedures for a variety of difference emergencies, including but not limited to chemical spills and releases.  Roles and responsibilities are documented for key personnel, such as the control room operator, facility coordinator, and response team members.  Instructions are provided for controlling the release (consistent with Hazwoper training), administering first aid, contacting appropriate agency offices and for evacuating the facility, if necessary.  \n\n\n\nLike SA-400, the Emergency Response Plan for Employees and On Call Managers provides instructions for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases; documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; and procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Hazard information is provided for each on-site chemical subject to EPCRA-LEPC regulations. \n\n\n\nThe Off-Site Emergency Response Plan described above was developed in a cooperative effort with the Local Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning District of Berks County to meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 11003.  SA-400 is fully consistent with the Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.  Likewise, the Emergency Response Plan for Employees and On Call Managers is int"
