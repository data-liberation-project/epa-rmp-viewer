Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family owned, privately held company has operations in 14 states.  Twenty processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue Farms also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest U. S. grain companies.  Perdue also manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\n\tThe Perdue Farms Mid Atlantic Replineishment Center is a cold storage warehouse located at 5155 Chudoba Parkway in Prince George, VA.  Perdue Farms began operations at the facility December 20, 2000.  The property is surrounded by farm land, industrial, schools and residential areas.\n\n\tAnhydrous ammonia (R717), used as the refrigerant for the cooling system, is the only regulated substance covered by CFR Part 68 at Perdue's Prince George facility.  The total quantity of ammonia used is approximately 14,500 pounds, distributed throughout various systems components (compressor, pressure vessels, condensers, etc.) at the facility.  The majority of the refrigeration componenets are located in the refrigeration room, with the exception of the condensers, which are located on the roof: piping and the evaporators located throughout the facility. \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\tAs a concerned  member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilites are operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe working conditions and safe practi"

Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.  \n\n\tPerdue has developed and implemented Spill  Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans at each operations facilty, as required, as part of an overall chemcial management program.  The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Director of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\tThe Perdue Farms Prince George facililty maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  Perdue Farms also utilizes a preventative maintenance program for its system operating parameters and monitoring system daily with all observations logged on a checklist.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\tThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class invovles a catastrophic release from ammonia refrigeration.  The scenario involves the release of 14,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 1.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\tOne alternative release scenario have been considered:\n\n\t1.\tRelease of ammoina vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes.  The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (79.6 lbs/min) with a release duration of sixt"

The facility has a trained emergency response team, that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.  The written Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.  In addition, Perdue Farms training program includes annual refreshers.  Also, the plant will conduct a mock evacuation two times per year with at least one drill coordinated with local emergency responders (LEPC/Fire/EMS).\n\nRisk Communication Plan:\n\tAs part of its Risk Management Program, Perdue Farms has developed a RMP Communications Plan.  The goals of the plan are (1) educate the public on the potential risk of regulated substances used by Perdue; (2) to respond to any concerns that RMP discovers may cause with honest, fact-based communications; and (3) to be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental chemical release scenario.  Proactive materials about the disclosure information, accident and a process for announcing that an accident has occured (to be used as needed) are being prepared.  In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civic groups, the media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the publc in general will be available.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\tThis facility was built in 2000 and built with state of the art equipment, in addition to latest technologies in ammoina refrigeration systems.  There are no planned changes to improve"
