This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nCopano Energy, LLC owns and Copano Processing, LLC operates the Houston Central Gas Plant located in Colorado County, Texas. The gas plant receives produced natural gas via pipeline. Residue gas is removed from the plant by pipeline. The hydrocarbon liquids are fractionated at the Houston Central Gas Plant and the fractionated products are shipped out via pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge, Copano Energy identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. There are no toxic substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Houston Central Gas Plant. Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities in the plant are methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane.\n\n\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant has not had an accidental release in the past five years and emergency response procedures have been coordinated with the Columbus Volunteer Fire Department and the Sheriff's Office.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Houston Central Gas Plant.

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). Also, the gas plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP/What If analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as we'll as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations,(4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Houston Central Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.
