This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  Camino Real Foods has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nCamino Real Foods is located at 2638 East Vernon Avenue in Vernon, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for freezer, cold storage and processing areas.  The system uses a maximum of 16,550 pounds of ammonia within four separate refrigeration systems.\n\n\n\nA refrigeration system is a closed loop system that cycles ammonia through a series of equipment and valves, changing the pressure/temperature resulting in a phase change (liquid/gas) of the ammonia. The cycle begins at the storage vessel (high pressure receiver) where it will be sent directly to heat exchangers (process equipment, evaporators, etc.) or through an intermediary vessel (recirculator) where the pressure/temperature will be reduced prior to entering any remaining processing/cooling equipment. Within the processing/cooling equipment, the ammonia absorbs the heat from the surrounding air/product resulting in a change of phase (liquid to gas). This liquid/gas mixture is sent to the compressors (via accumulators) where the gas is incr"

      "SummaryText": "eased in pressure and temperature. It is then discharged to the condensers where water is used to condenser the high pressure gas into high pressure liquid. The liquid is gravity drained to the high pressure receivers to begin the cycle again.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCamino Real Foods has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the OES CalARP regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\n?    Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n\n?    Written procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\n\n?    Training for employees involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\n?    Written procedures for managing system changes and startup of a modified process;\n\n?    Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence;\n\n?    Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the regulated processes;\n\n?    Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; and\n\n?    Employee involvement in program development and implementation. \n\n\n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering "

In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCamino Real Foods has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department for assistance as necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis, Seismic Assessments and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Camino Real Foods has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements.\n\n\n\nExternal Events\n\nExternal events that could impact the operation of the ammonia system were discussed during the Hazard Review study.  Examples of events considered include various weather conditions, onsite and offsite fires, meteorite and missile impacts, theft, etc"

The External Events Matrix was completed during the most recent PHA in April 2021. A seismic assessment was also performed by a licensed structural engineer, on the following systems and dates:\n\n\n\nMay 23, 2018\n\n?    Main Refrigeration System\n\n?    Mechanical Refrigeration System 1 & 2\n\n?    Mechanical Refrigeration System 4\n\n\n\nApril 20, 2021\n\n?

Recommendations were made during the inspection to install anchorage bolts and lateral restraints.  The facility is in the process of implementing these recommendations.  See the Seismic Assessment Report for further details."
