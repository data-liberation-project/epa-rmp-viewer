The Safety Officers at the Treatment Plants have a primary job consisting in Plant Operations and then secondary as Safety, in which they coordinate all inspections, safety equipment and employee assistance in Safety at the Treatment Plants.\r\n\r\nPROGRAM ADMINISTRATION\r\nBowling Green Municipal Utilities on April 27, 1989 hired a full-time Safety Director so that BGMU could develop and implement a written Safety Program. With that hiring, the major obstacle was achieving compliance in the OSHA, EPA and DOT regulations so that BGMU and all the employees would have a safe and healthful work environment. On March 3, 2008 Bowling Green Municipal Utilities hired a Safety Coordinator to assist the Safety Director with all health and safety issues within the company. To this date the Safety Department now handles all of the compliance programs in the Electric, Water/Wastewater and General Services Divisions, with the only exception being environmental issues that directly involve the Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Program, which the Industrial Pretreatment Director handles. Bowling Green Municipal Utilities initialized a Accident/Safety Committee on October 26, 1994 starting with a member from each work area for a total of 10 members. This committee reviews accidents/incidents and makes recommendations to submit for the BGMU Managers for their interpretation and implementation.

The Commonwealth of Kentucky mandates the use of a disinfectant Chlorine in Public Water Supplies.  Chlorine is used as a primary and secondary disinfectant at the Water Treatment Plant.  The average amount of Chlorine used is 550 pounds per day.\r\n\r\n  The Water Treatment Plant feed system consists of seven (7) W & T V-Notch type chlorinators.  During normal operation at the Water Treatment Plant, ten (10) cylinders (1 ton each) are connected in parallel to the manifold system.  The manifolds are a split type with automatic switchover systems allowing selected amounts of cylinders to be used at a given time.\r\n\r\n  Storage room maximum capacity at the Water Treatment Plant is fifteen (one) 1 ton cylinders.  Normal operation at the Water Treatment Plant would be five (5) cylinders in service with five (5) cylinders ready to switch over for use.  The other five (5) cylinders are stored on cradles at floor level.\r\n\r\n  Within this section are schematics of the chlorine feed and storage areas for the Water Treatment facility.  Additionally, equipment information, \"Kit B\" emergency repair kit location, and SDS data and chlorine information are included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBGMU CHLORINE INFORMATON AND RESPONSE PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nGeneral Operations and Maintenance\r\n\r\nI.\tPlant Operators with assistance from other Operators or Maintenance Technicians shall unload and/or load, switch over"
