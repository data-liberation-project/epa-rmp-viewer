The area immediately surrounding the facility is both agricultural and industrial.\n\n\n\nThe Performance Food Group facility changed ownership and was refurbished in 2017 with October 10, 2017 as the new startup date. The primary business of this location is cold storage warehousing of food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility will use 16,979 pounds of ammonia in a single closed-loop ammonia refrigera"

The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage of various food products.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:  The facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins \"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nPrevention programs are in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  \n\n\n\nEngineering Measures: It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over pressurization. The relief valves vent to a water diffusion tank designed to hold one gallon of water per pound of ammonia which could be release from the largest relief valve.\n\n\n\nThe engine room "

These detectors will activate a visual and audible alarm inside and outside the room entrance at 25 ppm. In addition, at 25 ppm, the refrigeration controls will shut down the liquid feed solenoid valves to stop the flow of refrigerant into all air units in the affected room. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Performance Food Group Roosevelt facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  \n\n\n\nThis Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the operator plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSince this is a new facility (Possible startup October 2017), there is no accident history to report.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Hazards Review was conducted September 14th, 16th, 17th,  2017 and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.
