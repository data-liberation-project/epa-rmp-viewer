      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of the C. T. Perry Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and the Montgomery Water Works and Sanitary Sewer Board (MWWSSB) to operate the WTP safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and the environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, and to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Perry WTP.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities:  Drinking water treatment is the main activity.\nUse of Regulated Substances: Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are odor control and iron removal.\n\nQuantities of Chlorine Handled or Stored\nAmount Handled:  Two 1-ton containers, equivalent to 4,600 pounds; \nAmount Stored:  Twelve 1-ton containers, equivalent to 27,600 pounds\n\nChlorine Worst-case Release Scenarios \nFailure of two liquid chlorine cylinders resulting in a release of 4,600 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes.  There are no administrative controls in place.  The 12 containers are stored in an enclosed building that provides passive mitigation.  The release rate is 1.91 kg/s, which is modeled using DEGADIS 2.1.\nDistance to Endpoint:  Under the worst-case weather conditions prescribed by the RMP rule, the distance to a toxic endpoint of 3 ppm is 2.37 miles, beyond which there will be enough dispersion to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nChlorine Alternative Release Scenarios\nRelease of chlorine from a pipe 3/8-inch in diameter connecting the chlorine container to the evaporator.  For a release duration of 15 minutes, the release rate is 0.1 kg/s.  Chlorine sensors at the Perry WTP detect concentrations of chlorine greater than 5 ppm and activate the chlorine scrubber.  The chlorine "

The release rate from the scrubber of 0.001 kg/s is modeled using DEGADIS 2.1.\nDistance to Endpoint:  Under realistic weather conditions of 3.0 m/s wind speed and a wind stability class of \"D,\" chlorine could travel 0.07 miles or 0.11 kilometers before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe Perry WTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems such as administrative, technical, and O&M procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a checklist extracted from the Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nDuring the past 5 years, the Perry WTP had one accidental release of chlorine gas.  It occurred on November 22, 1994.  The release lasted for 5 to 10 seconds and fewer than 10 pounds of chlorine gas were released.  One person onsite was injured, hospitalized for the night, and missed 6 days of work.  No one offsite was injured, and no evacuation was necessary.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe MWWSSB has an Emergency Response Program, which applies to the Perry WTP, that coordinates response efforts with the local fire department's HAZMAT team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Alabama Emergency Management Office Agency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed that the Perry WTP has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination system.  The changes to improve process safety identified during the hazard review, and those identified in the report, Vulnerability Analysis of the Water and Wastewater Systems, is provided below:\nUpgrade site security by modifying or constructing a"
