      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis document represents the updated and revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Calpine King City Cogen, LLC (CKCC) located in King City, California. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n\n\n-Acknowledge the continued operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and  requirements. (EPA RMP Facility ID# 1000-0016-4877)\n\n\n\nCKCC uses anhydrous ammonia and stores greater than 20,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia making the site subject to both the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and the Federal RMP Program under 40 CFR 68. The site is subject to the OSHA and EPA Process Safety Management Regulations. The site has been determined to be a Program Level 3 facility.\n\n\n\nThe RMP addresses the Program 3 requirements of CalARP as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the general duty clause of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP Program 3 requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n\n\n-identify hazards\n\n-design and maintain a safe facility\n\n-prevent releases\n\n-minimize the consequences of releases.\n\n\n\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented RMP, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. \n\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\n\n\n\nThis RMP applies to the CKCC facility located at:\n\n750 Metz Road\n\nKing City, CA.  93930\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe CKCC facility is a 111-megawatt (MW) (nominal output) natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant. Electricity generated by CKCC is sold to Pacific Gas and Electric Compa"

First responders at the operations level have the duty to protect nearby people, property, and the environment and take defensive action from a safe distance to try to stop the release from spreading and make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. The fire departments will handle spill/release response and mitigation. In the event of a major release, CKCC may join forces with the fire departments and State/County OES personnel in a \"unified command effort\" until the emergency has been mitigated.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\n\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\n\nA?    Periodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, piping network, flow controllers, and injection grid.\n\nA?    Monitoring of tank level and system pressures.\n\nA?    Monitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\n\nA?    Installation and use of ammonia detector(s) in the main tank area.\n\nA?    Provide all required safety and response equipment.\n\nA?    Provide a chemical specific training program.\n\nA?    Access to the CKCC facility site is controlled and fenced.\n\nThe piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. System pressures and flow rates will be monitored at the main plant control room console. The P&IDs indicate that there is numerous pressure, and level indicating sensors, which send a signal directly to the distributed control system (DCS) for operator confirmation and action.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    Presently, Calpine is operating and constructing a number of similar peaking and base loaded power generation facilities in California.

A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.\n\nThe training program is comprised of the following:\n\nA?

These modifications may require that the process safety information be revised and updated. The pre-startup review applies to additions or modifications, which require the process safety information to be updated. The facility pre-startup safety review procedure will be contained within the plant operations manuals. The review generally addresses the following issues:\n\nA?
