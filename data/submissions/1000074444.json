(OREG4) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility complies with numerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal process safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire detection monitors. OREG4 provides high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request their assistance.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source\r\n\r\nThe OREG 4 process is located adjacent to a gas pipeline compressor station.  The pipeline compressor is driven by a natural gas turbine.  The OREG process is fueled by waste heat from the gas compressor's turbine exhaust. \r\n\r\nWaste heat is converted to electrical energy by utilizing organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid.  The heat transfer fluid reaches a maximum temperature of 572\u00b0F.  At this particular location, there are two turbines exhausting to two WHOHs.  The heat transfer fluid flows in parallel to the WHOHs, then recombines to feed the single Ormat Energy Converter (OEC).  In"

      "SummaryText": "the OEC, the recombined thermal oil stream is circulated to the shell and tube heat exchangers. The motive fluid (pentane) on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive an organic fluid turbine. The turbine drives a generator which produces grid-compatible power. The turbine exhaust vapors are then condensed in an air-cooled heat exchanger and enter the cycle again as a liquid. On the thermal oil side of the heat exchangers, after exiting the heat exchangers, the thermal oil is routed through a thermal oil surge tank, thermal oil feed pumps, and back to the WHOH. \r\n\r\nThe power from this project is sold to Highline Electric Association based in Holyoke, CO.  The facility is rated at 6000 KW. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5100 KW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air cooled heat exchangers.\r\n\r\nUse of Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as the working fluid in the organic Rankine cycle. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the pentane conditions in that section. The sections include: the low pressure process equipment, the high pressure process equipment, pentane unloading system, vapor recovery system, evacuation system and non-condensable removal system. Each section is protected by pressure relief systems that may include pressure safety valves, pressure control valves, control system shutdown and intervention logic an"

When in operation, the majority of the pentane is found in the working process.  There is some additional pentane present in the connected storage tank.  For the purpose of defining registration quantities, a fully-charged operating system is assumed plus a storage tank that contains up to 3,500 gallons.

Examination of topographic maps and visual observation of the potentially affected area in a worst case scenario did not identify any residential structures or parks.  However, this facility is adjacent to the compressor station that provides the heat source and this station is within the affected area.  The compressor station staff is not employed by Ormat, nor does Ormat control their access to the compressor station.  Given this proximity to public receptors, this facility cannot qualify for an RMP program level 1. In the initial RMP submittal, compressor station employees were not considered public receptors; hence, a program level 1 was designated.  Although program level 1 was initially designated, the OREG always had a program level 3 prevention program in place.\r\n\r\nAlternate Case Scenario Description\r\n\r\nThe alternate case scenario is based on a pool fire.

Safety systems are present in the plant that provide alarms and control interlocks to place the process in a safe state.\r\n\r\nHigh pressure safety systems are one such example.  An initial alarm alerts the control room operator both audibly and visually of the pressure rise.  This initial alarm affords the operator the opportunity to take some corrective action.

If the initial alarm and subsequent shutdown fail to mitigate the pressure rise, pressure safety valves are in place to relieve to pressure to the atmosphere or to larger, low pressure systems. \r\n\r\nA combustible gas detection system is present in each of the plants.
