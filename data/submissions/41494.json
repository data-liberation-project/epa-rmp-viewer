To assist with ongoing compliance, a Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual have been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nThis facility is a waste water treatment plant.  Treatment includes chlorination of the waste water with three chlorine cylinders located at the facility (2,000 lbs each).  Treatment also includes dechlorination via the addition of sulfur dioxide with two sulfur dioxide cylinders located at the facility (2,000 lbs each).  The process basically involves continuous mixing of chlorine with the waste water whereby the final mixture contains less than 1% chlorine by weight.  This mixture is then routed to a contact chamber and sulfur dioxide is added whereby the final mixture is less than 1% by weight of sulfur dioxide.  The treated waste water is then released.  The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to the RMP requirements since it contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  Chlorine capacity on site is 6,000 pounds and sulfur dioxide capacity is 4,000 pounds.\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario #1 involves the release of all substance contained in the single largest chlorine cylinder when full (2,000 lbs total).  Scenario #2 involves the release of all substance contained in the single largest sulfur dioxide cylinder when full (2,000 lbs total).  Both scenarios yield the same distance to the endpoint which is 1.3 miles.\n\nThis facility has two alternative release scenarios.  Scenario #1 involves a puncture of the largest diameter chlorine cylinder when full.  Scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario #2 involves a puncture of the largest diameter sulfur dioxide cylinder when full.  Both scenarios yield the same distance to the endpoint which is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios use the maximum capacity of the sincle largest vessel without administrative controls or mitigation measures to limit the volume or reduce the distance to the endpoint.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss both chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are the specific chemicals contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of a release.  Basically, the instructions are to evacuate the facility and then notify the proper authorities.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
