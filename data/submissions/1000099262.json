The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Dickinson City and Rural Fire Departments and other agencies involved with a response including the Local Emergency Planning Commission.  Representatives of the Dickinson area Fire Departments visited this plant on an annual basis.  \r\n\r\nThere has been no reportable accidents resulting in a release of ammonia in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nBaker Boy has committed to the safe operating of our ammonia refrigeration system."

      "SummaryText": "The Baker Boy Inc. facility located in Dickinson, North Dakota is a producer of frozen bakery products that handles ammonia which is considered toxic by EPA. The primary purpose of this facility is to make frozen dough products and baked products that are frozen for distribution to independent distributors.  The facility started up a new portion of the ammonia refrigeration system in 1998 bringing the amount of ammonia on site from less than 500 pound to an amount less than 10,000 in 1998.  Additional equipment was added in 2003, 2006 and 2012 which put us over the 10,000 pound threshold.  The current system is charged with 21,500 pounds of refrigeration grade ammonia.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the products being handled.  The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located at various areas within the facility.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\r\n\r\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.
