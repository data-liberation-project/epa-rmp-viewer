The facility is currently operating a 102,000 square foot frozen storage warehouse.  As a result of this change, the amount of ammonia on site has been reduced from previous levels.  Approximately 19,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is currently used as a refrigerant for the cold storage warehouse.\n\n\n\nIt is policy of Cedar Grove Warehouse to assure safe and healthful working conditions for every employee and to comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations including OSHA Process Safety Management and Federal Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act.  Cedar Grove Warehouse will provide adequate safeguards against health and safety hazards by providing a safe work environment, job training and instruction on safe procedures, making personal protective gear available, and proper administration of safety programs and activities.  To reduce the risk of accidental ammonia release there are engineering and mechanical safeguards in place including physical barriers to protect ammonia lines and vessels, high level cutoff controls, relief valves, and a PLC based monitoring and operating system with built in alarms and controls.\n\n\n\nThe facility has two (2) operational separate and independent (they do not share/exchange ammonia between each other) refrigeration systems.  The original and primary system was the largest and held over 50,000 pounds of ammonia.  This system is no longer operational and has been taken out of service.  The second system (an expansion freezer) was added in 1995 and holds approximately 9,800 pounds of ammonia.  The third system is another expansion freezer and it also holds approximately 9,800 pounds of ammonia.  The two expansion freezers are similar in design, but not exactly the same.  Together they hold a charge of 19,600 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammoni"

It is the policy of Cedar Grove Warehouse to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Cedar Grove Warehouse implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through an on going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nCedar Grove Warehouse is located at 430 7th Avenue South, in Buhl, Idaho.  The facility is approximately 0.3 miles north of Idaho Highway 30.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of residential areas, farmland, and commercial areas.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again. The systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle a total of 19,600 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to keep storage rooms cold and/or cool for food products.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing heat from the cold rooms.  Transferring heat to the ammonia causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia and the heat is dissipated to the atmosphere as the heat is removed from the refrigerant, it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions r"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Cedar Grove Warehouse to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Safe Work Practices program ensures that Cedar Grove Warehouse's employees and contractors follow Lockout / Tagout, Hazard Communication, Hot Work (e.g. welding), and Chemical and General Safety Procedures in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must follow specified precautions to safely complete projects.\n\n\n\nThe facility also operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making A"

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\n\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: emergency shutdown switches that de-energize equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and continuous ventilation (controlled by a thermostat) in the Compressor Rooms to prevent explosions. The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will:\n\n\n\n20 ppm:    Activates the visual alarm (yellow light) in the Engine Rooms and at the Engine Room doors and turns on the exhaust fans to low speed.
