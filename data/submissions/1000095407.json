We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. Superior Catfish maintains an open dialogue with local emergency responders and has provided them with a copy of its Emergency Action Plan, detailing important facility-specific information. This document, or Risk Management Plan (RMP), provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including the following:\r\nA. A description of our facility and its use of anhydrous ammonia, in a single process, which is a regulated substance under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule),\r\nB. A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases,\r\nC. An overview of our accidental release prevention programs,\r\nD. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia,\r\nE. An overview of the Emergency Response Program, and\r\nF. An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\r\n2.0 Superior Catfish and Regulated Substances\r\nSuperior Catfish's primary activity involves the processing of fish products. We use Anhydrous Ammonia (ammonia) that EPA has identified on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list.\r\n3.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nSuperior Catfish maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation. In addition, Superior Catfish parallels the RMP Rule by complying with process safety management (PSM) as outlined in OSHA (29"

Involvement will include PSM Progress Meetings; Memos; Bulletins; and actual hands-on involvement in the PSM development.\r\nEmployees will be involved in the process of completing and maintaining the facility's on-going Process Safety Management Program.\r\n3.11 Hot Work Permits\r\nWritten procedures have been prepared for obtaining a Hot Work Permit. Refrigeration Operating Personnel who will perform Hot Work will be issued a Hot Work Permit for operations conducted on or near a covered process. The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\r\n3.12 Contractor Information\r\nPSM is not only concerned with employee safety but also contractor safety. Information will be provided to the contract employees on safe work practices; known hazards; and the emergency action plan of the facility. Documentation will be obtained from contractors to ensure that training of contractor employees in performing their specific job tasks and also in the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to his job and the process, and applicable provisions of the emergency action plan has taken place and is understood. Contractors conducting Hot Work (including welding) are required to comply with the ARS Hot Work Permit Program.\r\n4.0 Chemical Specific Prevention Steps 4.1 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\nSeveral process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases of ammonia.

Inspection and testing of the process equipment will also take place with any deficiencies corrected. Operating personnel will be trained in Mechanical Integrity procedures.\r\n3.6 Management of Change\r\nWhen a change is intended for the Ammonia Refrigeration System, there are specific procedures to follow to ensure that all aspects of PSM have been updated and that every affected employee is informed of, and trained relative to the change.\r\n3.7 Pre-startup Reviews\r\nWhen a significant change has taken place in the refrigeration system (see also Management of Change) or for new systems, a pre start-up safety review is conducted to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place, PSM has been updated, and affected employees are trained prior to the introduction of ammonia or startup of a system.\r\n3.8 Compliance Audits\r\nThis is part of the on-going maintenance of the PSM program. Every three years the entire PSM program will be audited to make sure every section has been maintained. The facility may choose to do the audit themselves or to hire an outside company. In either case, audit results will be documented and deficiencies corrected. Any action as a result of the audit that would affect an employee's work is communicated to them.\r\n3.9 Incident Investigation\r\nAn incident investigation team will be established to thoroughly investigate and analyze any catastrophic release or near misses. The team will prepare a report on the incident, which will be reviewed with all affected personnel."

The following sections, as taken from the PSM program, provide a brief summary of the release prevention program at our facility.\r\n3.1 Process Safety Information\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is the first step in the PSM program before any Process Hazard Analysis can be completed. PSI consists of employee participation in gathering and documenting information on each piece of ammonia refrigeration equipment and the ammonia refrigeration system as a whole. This includes equipment information such as manufacturer, model, pressure settings, horsepower, operating ranges, etc.\r\n3.2 Process Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts a process hazard analysis (PHA) to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. Designated refrigeration workers, supervisors, and managers and/or any other employee representative will meet as the PHA team to develop a What- If Process Hazard Analysis. Active participation is encouraged in the discussion of the standard What-Ifs and the development of new What-Ifs that would be site-specific for the facility. After completion of the PHA, recommendations will be documented for future follow-up.\r\n3.3 Operating Procedures\r\nWritten standard operating procedures are maintained to ensure facility activities are conducted safely. This includes site-specific standard operating procedures developed through meetings with refrigeration workers and discussing step-by-step actual procedures used for maintaining ammonia refrigeration equipment.\r\nAlso incorporated are existing safe work practices such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.
