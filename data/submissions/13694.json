To achieve this end, Venoco strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \n\nVenoco implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environmental are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\nThe Carpinteria Oil & Gas Plant Facility is located in the extreme southeast corner of Santa Barbara County, about 600 feet from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 3 miles south of the Santa Ynez Mountains. The elevation of the Oil & Gas Plant site is about 50 feet above sea level.  The nearest earthquake faults are the Mesa-Rincon Creek Fault Zone and the More Ranch-Mission Ridge-Arroyo Parida Fault Zone  The approximate coordinates of the plant are longitude 1190 30' 21\" west and latitude 340 23' 16\" north.\n \nThe Oil & Gas Plant is located in an open area as shown on E-SB-10758-2 and E-SB-10719A-1 (Appendix A) at the Venoco Carpinteria facility, 5675 Carpinteria Avenue.  The area is bounded on the north by Carpinteria City Hall, on the south by the Southern-Pacific Railroad and the Pacific Ocean beyond, on the west by Dump Road, and on the east by the Brown & Serena property (Carpinteria Bluff's Development).

The Carpinteria City Hall is approximately 400 feet to the north.  Businesses within <-mile (1,300 feet) include an auto repair shop, two motels, and a game court.  These and U.S. 101 are considered public receptors under the RMP regulation.  Carpinteria State Beach is approximately d-mile (2,000 feet) to the west and is both a public and environmental receptor under the regulation. \n\n Figure 1-1.  Area Map\n The Oil & Gas Plant consists of one Program 3 process which utilizes several operations to process natural gas and natural gas liquids product. The Gas Plant qualifies for Program 3 because it is subject to the federal Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under federal (codified at 29 CFR 1910.119), or state OSHA programs.\n\nA process flow diagram of the gas plant is shown in Figure 1-2.  The Oil & Gas Plant currently processes about 4,000 barrels per day of crude oil, 9 million cubic feet per of pipeline quality sales gas, and 3,200 gallons per day of mixed natural gas liquids (NGL).  A glycol dehydration unit removes excess moisture from the gas prior to low temperature separation of NGL from the sales gas.  Since the field gas is naturally sweet, no desulfurization or CO2 removal unit is required.\n\nMajor process steps include the following:\n\na) Initial gas dehydration;\nb) Gas/NGL separation (V-101);\nc) NGL Reboiling (V-103);\nd) NGL vessels (V-20 and V-21 bullets); and\ne) Blending of NGL with crude oil (pumps and LACT unit). \n\nTable 1-1 shows mixed NGL system capacities for determination of RMP applicability.

The estimated residential population which could be impacted by releases is approximately 500, based on census tract information. \n\n1.4.1  Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worse-case release for flammables, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is less than the maximum capacity, and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released instantaneously and ignited at the point of release.  \n\nThe worse-case release scenario modeled for the facility is a sudden release of the entire volume of the flammable material stored in the largest of two NGL storage vessels. The OCA first assumes a worst-case catastrophic (instantaneous) release of all NGL stored in one of the two NGL bullets each having a maximum capacity of 15,000 gallons, or approximately 77,550 pounds of mixed NGL.  \n  \nThe worse-case release scenarios identified off-site impacts, but the impact area includes minimal public and residential receptors and no environmental receptors.

The more realistic alternate-case II scenario impacts few, if any, residences. \n\n1.5  Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nIn addition to being subject to RMP requirements the Carpinteria Oil & Gas Plant is subject to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions), the Carpinteria Oil & Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program.  \n\nCompliance with PSM's comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes which handle flammable or toxic materials.  The objective of the PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, Venoco has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective PSM program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process. Using this approach the following components were considered in the evaluation:  1) the process design; 2) process technology; 3) process changes; 4) operational and maintenance activities and procedures; 5) non-routine activities and procedures; 6) e"

The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level.  PSM is the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment.  The elements of the company's PSM and accidental release prevention program are summarized below:\n\nProcess Safety Information - This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment essential to the company's PSM program and to a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards, technology and the equipment of the natural gas processing system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable or toxic materials.  The PHA provides information that will assist the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable or toxic materials.  As part of the company's PSM program a PHA has been conducted for the Carpinteria Oil & Gas Plant. \n\nOperating Procedures - As part of the PSM program, all procedures for operating and maintaining the natural gas processing system are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this system.  As needed, changes or updates to the natural gas processing system operating procedures are incorporated under the company's management of change program.\n\nEmployee Training - Personnel performing specific tasks which affect the natural gas processing system"

The company utilizes an established training program that ensures the training and competency of employees whose jobs require them to perform work which affect the natural gas processing system. \n\nMechanical Integrity - Under the PSM program, equipment used to process, store, or handle flammable or toxic materials has to be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the release of such chemicals.  As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.\n\nManagement of Change - Contemplated changes to a process must be evaluated thoroughly to fully assess their impact on employee safety and health and to determine needed changes to operating procedures.  The company has established and implemented procedures to manage changes (except for \"replacements in kind\") to process chemicals, technology equipment and procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the natural gas processing system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - As one of the requirements of PSM, Venoco is required to perform a pre-startup safety review for new facilities, and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  Although the processes at the Carpinteria Oil & Gas Plant are essentially mature, and therefore the start up of new processes are not anticipated, a PHA will be performed prior to start up for new processes which require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold.  For existing processes that have been shutdown for turnaround or modification, company policy ensures that any changes other than \"replacement in kind\" made to the process during shutdown"

Application of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Response Plans or ERP) and the emergency response element of PSM.  The basic concept of Venoco's emergency procedures are to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies.  The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\nThe ERP, contained in the Business Plan, is designed to be applicable to any type of emergency that may affect Venoco and based on the concept that the elements of emergency response are similar, regardless of the hazard.

An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and information, including statistical information, to verify compliance with the PSM standards.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the PSM system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the PSM program elements are effectively implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation - A crucial part of Venoco's PSM program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented.  Accordingly, Venoco has an incident investigation program which requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable or toxic material.\n \nEmployee Participation Plan - Venoco has developed written procedures to include employees in the development, implementation and management of these PSM program elements.\n\nHot Work & Safe Work Practices - Venoco has established safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.
