If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify Upper Deerfield Township Fire Department as well as the Upper Deerfield Twp.

The LPG is transferred to storage vessels consisting of three (3) 60,000 gallon LPG storage cylinders and two (2) 30,000 LPG storage cylinders via four[4] transloading towers. In addition, liquid transfers can occur directly from the railcars via one (1) of five [5] total transloading towers to transport vehicles without prior transfer to a storage cylinder.  The stored liquefied gases are loaded to transport vehicles from the storage cylinders via four (4) loading stations.
