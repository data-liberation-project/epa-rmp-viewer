This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. The Plant has been designated as a Non-Responding facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.90(b). In the event of a major release and/or fire, Marathon will utilize trained contract response personnel for emergency response and recovery operations and/or may rely upon local fire department capabilities as well as mutual aid from other fire departments.\n \n  \n  DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant is located in St. Mary Parish, near the city of Burns Point, Louisiana, off highway 317.  It is a single process that removes a mixture of petroleum liquid products (e.g., ethane, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas. The Burns Point Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane, ethane, and butane, but it has no regulated toxic substances. \n \n As described in the registration information of the plant, Burns Point Gas Plant maintains eight full time employees with a maximum of four there at any given time due to the work rotation schedule of the employees.  The employees work on a seven days on and seven days off rotation schedule leaving a maximum of four employees at the plant at any given time. \n  \n  OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n  \n  The worst-case release scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable su"

      "SummaryText": "bstances at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the of the Product Surge Vessel which has the largest inventory containing predominate mixtures of Ethane, Propane and Butane. The Product Surge Vessel normally operates at approximately 28% of its capacity, at 410 psia and contains approximately 26,000 pounds of liquid hydrocarbon mixture product.  If the vessel were to fill to full capacity with liquid product it would contain approximately 92,000 pounds of product.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS involving full inventory of the vessel is 0.37 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n  \n  The alternate release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from the release of the plant product (ethane, propane, and butane) from a transfer line on the product pipeline pumps.  (500 lb released in 3 minutes). The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 3 minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.06 mile. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning. Again, for the purposes of this release scenario, it is assumed that the numerous safety devices, such as; the pressure and level safety low detection devices on the product surge vessel do not function properly and it takes the plant operator three minutes to detect and isolate the release.\n  \n  \n  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n  \n  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The process at the gas plant is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP), and is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) st"

This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n  \n  \n Employee Participation\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the \"Process Safety Management / Safety and Environmental Management Program Manual\" (PSM/SEMP Manual) that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. \n  \n  Process Safety Information\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, and equipment design basis/configuration information. In coordination with the Gulf Coast Region's operation staff in Lafayette, Louisiana, Burns Point Gas Plant personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan summarized in the \"PSM/SEMP Manual\". \n  \n  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs), which are kept at the plant.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n  \n  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard analysis \"What If - Checklist\" technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, and a person from the plant is always included on the team.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n  \n  The Hazards Analysis (HA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  All approved mitigation options in response to HA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n  \n   This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n  \n Training\n  \n  To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Burns Point Gas plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  New operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures when procedures change to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, including the location of MSDS's for the plant,  (3) emergency action plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning work. In addition, the contractor safety programs and performance are reviewed during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n \n  \n  Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review also provides a check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review uses a checklist to verify all aspects of readiness including verification that the accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n  \n  Mechanical Integrity\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures, developed in conjunction with relevant and a"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n  \n  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Burns Point Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. Equipment specifications comply with Marathon's \"General Specification Manual\" and equipment purchases follow the Gulf Coast Region's \"Requisitioning and Purchasing Procedures\".  This helps ensure that equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n  \n  Safe Work Practices\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of plant personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n  \n  Management of Change\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the process.

Affected process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n  \n  Incident Investigation\n  \n  The Burns Point Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future HAs and HA re-validations. \n  \n  Compliance Audits\n  \n  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Burns Point Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

No significant incidents involving regulated substances have occurred over the past five years that resulted in on- or off-site effects. \n  \n  \n  \n  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n  \n    Since Burns Point Gas Plant has been designated as a Non-Responding facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.90(b), it in not required to maintain a formal Emergency Response Plan. It does maintain a written Emergency Action Plan, (as required by OSHA under 29CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The plan addresses, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs as well as a training personnel to properly react to an emergency at the Burns Point Gas Plant. The Emergency Action Plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant facilities.\n \n The overall Emergency Action Plan for the Burns Point Gas Plant is coordinated with the Morgan City Fire Department, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The Burns Point Gas Plant and Marathon's Lafayette regional office have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).
