The company management has many years of safe transportation and distribution operations of chlorine and other products in Alaska.  The company is establishing a new facility for the storage of chlorine at a location in an industrial area near the Old Seward Highway and the railroad; the facility is an open fenced lot with no buildings.\n\nOcean Terminals Inc. will store chlorine in pressurized containers at the Anchorage Storage Yard located at 501 E. 92nd Avenue in Anchorage, Alaska.  The maximum quantity chlorine stored will be up to 23 ton containers and 30 -150 pound cylinders on trailers inside a fenced ? acre open yard.  The facility will be unmanned, with Ocean Terminals personnel and transportation personnel visiting the site weekly.  The chlorine containers are shipped from Tacoma, Washington on Ocean Terminals trailers specially designed for transporting chorine containers.  The trailers are unloaded at the Port of Anchorage and delivered to the storage yard by shipping line personnel.  The chlorine containers are stored in the yard on trailers.  The Ocean Terminals? employee loads the chlorine containers in the storage yard and delivers the chlorine to customers in the Anchorage area.  The empty containers are picked up and loaded on to the trailers for transport back to the port and shipment back to Tacoma.  Ocean Terminals may also store empty trailers and other products at the yard.  \n\nThe facility is located approximately ? mile east and ? mile northwest of residential areas and ? mile west of a major commercial area, therefore the conservative Offsite Consequence Analysis methodology was selected using the EPA OCA Guidance Reference Tables for worst case and alternative releases from a 2,000 pound chlorine container.   \n\nThe release prevention program is based on the stringent Department of Transportation requirements for chlorine ha"

The Ocean Terminals delivery truck driver has received extensive training and certification for DOT Hazardous Materials transportation and handling.  The OSHA PSM requirements do not apply to the facility because it is unmanned and distributes chlorine only to end users (retail).  \n\nFor the emergency response program, the Ocean Terminals employee will only occasionally visit the facility; a sign will be posted on the facility gate with emergency information.  The facility emergency response procedures for the unlikely event of a release at the facility will be the same as during transport on the streets and highways.  Ocean Terminals will rely on the local hazardous materials response capabilities of the Anchorage Fire Department to respond to a chlorine release.  The Ocean Terminals employee will assess the situation based on his training and experience, call 911 to report the release, remain on the scene to assist emergency response personnel."
