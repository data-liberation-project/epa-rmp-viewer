Senior Management reviews the status of each facility each month and institutes changes, when necessary, to make the facility safer. Our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Skyland Grain, LLC. has employees that have been through HazWoper training (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.) The Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement. In addition, our facilities are in the SHARP's program so this adds another layer of examinations.\r\n\r\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site-specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and employees are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses ammonia resistant goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of\r\nemergency safety water during tank filling and maintenance operations.\r\nWith the above-mentioned training in mind, it makes it very easy to report that absolutely no injury actions or property damage have occurred at this facility since Skyland Grain, LLC. took over operations in 2016.\r\n\r\nSkyland Grain, LLC.'s anhydrous ammonia program is designed to minimize risk to employees, any first responders, and the surrounding public.
