      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that all facilities (both public and private) which utilize specific hazardous chemicals above defined threshold quantities in their processes, be in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) 40 CFR 112r Part 68.  The Clifton Water District (CWD) utilizes liquified chlorine in the treatment of water for use by the public.  Chlorine is on the list of hazardous chemicals covered by the threshold limits within the CAA.  The requirements presented in the CCA regarding processes that utilize hazardous chemicals identify specific safety precautions regarding handling and storage of the listed hazardous chemicals.  The CWD has specific release prevention and emergency response procedures in place to help prevent chemical exposure to water treatment personnel as well as the general public, given the life, health and safety hazards associated with liquified chlorine.  It is the policy of the Clifton Water district to strictly adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules, regulations, and, safety precautions.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Clifton Water District's Board of Directors and Management that the emergency action response plan utilized by the Clifton Water District is in compliance with OSHA's Employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plan, 29 CFR Part 1910.38.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the Clifton Fire District and the Grand Junction Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT) to respond to hazardous chemical releases at the water treatment plant, and to notify all potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\nFacility Description and Activities\n\nThe Clifton Water District provides domestic potable water to approximately 30,000 customers located in the unincorporated portion of Mesa County generally referred to as 'Clifton' (roughly the area encompassed from I-70 to the Colorado"

      "SummaryText": "se Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a one-ton cylinder of liquified chlorine is the catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact or construction defect of the cylinder.  This scenario assumes a release of the total contents, 2,000 pounds of chlorine in a ten (10) minute period.  The estimated perimeter from the water treatment plant, which could be affected, is 0.9 miles.  In this and any other scenario, the Clifton Fire Department and the Grand Junction Fire Department HAZMAT Team would be immediately notified and would respond to the release and would notify the public and the Local  Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of actions to take in the affected areas.  \n\nThe CWD feels this scenario is highly unlikely due to the procedures and work practices in place for handling the one-ton chlorine containers.  The originally installed hoisting framework (1979) was modified in 1997 with an engineered rail support extension and hoisting mechanism.  The chlorine storage/feed room is approximately four (4) feet higher than the vehicle access thus minimzing crash and puncture possibilities.\n  \n(NOTE:  The data for this release scenario was generated from EPA's RMP*Comp)\n\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario would take place within the enclosed chlorine storage/feed room.  The scenario assumes a leak in the feed pipe manifold either from corrosion or inadvertant contact which would result in the release of gas through a 5/16 diameter opening.  This scenario assumes a release of 11.3 pounds of chlorine per minute.  The estimated affected perimeter from the water treatment plant is 0.1 miles.  The Clifton Fire Department and Grand Junction Fire Department HAZMAT Team would be notified and would respond and notify the public and the LEPC of actions to take in the affected area.  The quantity of chemical released depends on how long it takes the HAZMAT team to respond and stop the release.  Assuming a 30 minute response and a 30 minute effort to s"

The original water treatment plant, and chlorine handling area, was constructed in 1979 to all applicable building codes and requirements.  The plant underwent expansion in 1981 and again in 1997.  Each time the plant was expanded, all applicable codes and requirements were followed and recommended chlorine handling modifications were implemented.  The District has in its five-year expansion plan to completely revamp the chlorine handling/storage/feed facility to all current State of Colorado and Chlorine Institute requirements.  Equipment and components related to receiving, feed process and final discharge of chlorine are inspected daily by plant personnel and are maintained and service according to equipment manufacturer's recommendations.  The water treatment personnel have been trained to follow specific operational and maintenance procedures while utilizing the chlorine process.\n\nIn January 1999, treatment plant operators received specific training on how to perform maintenance on the new chlorine analyzer, how to test the chlorine leak detector sensors, hands-on training on how to rebuild the regulator and chlorinator as well as the injectors and how to properly test the rebuilt components for assurance of operating within manufacturer's parameters.

The water treatment plant, along with the main business office is located at 510 34 Road, Clifton, CO.  The CWD processes water from the Colorado River through conventional water treatment practices as well as additional treatment through a state-of-the-art process utilizing membrane technology.\n\nLiquified chlorine is delivered in one-ton bulk cylinders by certified chemical transportation companies to the water treatment plant where it is off-loaded into the enclosed chlorine storage/feed room where the cylinder is connected to the manifold feed system.  The chlorine is fed to the treated water as a part of the final disinfection process prior to delivery to the end user.  The feed system utilizes two one-ton containers that are manually switched from empty to full via the valved manifold system by treatment plant operators.  This feed system is monitored daily by plant personnel as well as continuously monitored by leak sensors that are connected to both visual and audible alarms inside and outside the treatment plant.  During off-hours, the sensor alarm system is connected to an automatic phone dialer that notifies on-call treatment plant personnel if a leak occurs so that appropriate response can be initiated.\n\nAccess to the water treatment plant facility is controlled via locked gates and security fencing surrounding the facility.  The chlorine room itself is locked at all times to prevent unauthorized access.  All treatment plant personnel are thoroughly trained regarding the hazards and risks accociated with liquified chlorine for both themselves and the general public.

Chlorine release detection sensors are located in the storage/feed area and are set to alarm if a release is detected.  The alarms are both visual (exterior mounted strobe light) and audible (located both inside the plant and on the exterior).
