      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies. \n\n\tWe at the Dow Chemical Company are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are completely coordinated with Hamilton Township Fire Department and the Lawrence County LEPC, which provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.\tFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\t\n\tOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass Plastics and Foam Manufacturing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane [2-methylpropane] and Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile].  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in two uses.  Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] is used for manufacturing ABS plastic pellets.  Isobutane [2-methylpropane] is used in performance foam packaging products.  A third process titled Styrofoam,  contained the regulated substance Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] which is no longer used on our site and was therefore removed in the 2004 RMP submittal.\n\n\tTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, the Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios have been modeled using the PHAST program.  \n\n\n3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.  \n\nOur facility takes all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set for"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel;  training and procedure usage are also part of our maintenance discipline.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\tManagement of Change\n\n\tWritten procedures are in place at The Dow Chemical Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.   Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and trained on any applicable change in operating discipline associated with the modification.\n\n\tPre-startup Reviews\n\n\tPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The Dow Chemical Company.  The most recent review was performed on 01/12/2004.  These reviews are conducted to audit and verify that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\tCompliance Audits\n\n\tDow Chemical Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 01/28/2004.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are completed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\tIncident Investigation\n\n\tThe Dow Chemical Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the releas"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\tProcess Safety Information\n\n\tDow Chemical Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\tOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used at Dow to carry out these analyses are the What-If/Checklist, HAZOP, FMEA and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was performed on 01/27/2004.\n\n\tOperating Procedures\n\n\tFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Dow Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\tTraining\n\n\tDow Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  A management system is in place to assure initial and refresher training is provided to every applicable employee.\n\n\tMechanical Integrity\n\n\tDow Chemical Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessel"

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\tEmployee Participation\n\n\tThe Dow Chemical Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\tContractors\n\n\tOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Dow Chemical Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\n\n\tDow Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company has a written emergency response plan that documents our discipline in the unlikely event of an accidental release of a hazardous material.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\tTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.

Since the 1999 RMP submittal, Dow has implemented a new process technology which has eliminated one of the RMP chemicals (EthylChloride) used in our Styrofoam process and has thus eliminated the risk of that chemical.  The Dow Hanging Rock facility has also received a federal grant to install an extensive security camera surveillance project that is expected to be implemented by December 31, 2004."
