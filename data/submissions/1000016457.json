      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nIn 1999, Kennedy/Jenks Consultants (KJC) prepared Risk Management Program (RMP) plans for the City of San Buenaventura's (City) Avenue Water Treatment Plant (AWTP) and Bailey Water Conditioning Facility (BWCF), in accordance with the USEPA Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Clean Air Act, Section 112-r-7, Risk Management Program) and the related California Accidental Release Prevention (CALARP) Program.  In 2003 and 2004, the City prepared RMP Updates in compliance with the RMP and CALARP Programs for the AWTP, BWCF, and Saticoy Water Conditioning Facility (SWCF) due to the addition of aqueous ammonia (19 percent).  These facilities are subject to the requirements of the RMP and CALARP Programs due the quantity of gaseous chlorine and aqueous ammonia (19 percent) used and stored.  In addition, RMP and CALARP Plans are required prior to operating new or modified facilities.  This Plan updates the City's CALARP/RMP document as a result of the new chlorine storage and injection equipment at the Avenue WTP. \n\nEPARMP & CALARP Applicability\n\nIn California, the state-equivalent of the federal RMP is the CALARP program, which replaced the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).  The CALARP program requires facilities that handle regulated substances on the federal extremely hazardous substances list (or the state list of regulated substances), in quantities greater than federal or state threshold quantities, to submit a RMP plan.  The CALARP threshold for chlorine is 100 pounds.  Chlorine is subject to CALARP requirements until it is injected into water (reducing the concentration to below 1 percent).  Aqueous ammonia (19 percent) is also regulated under CALARP.  The threshold quantity for aqueous ammonia (19 percent) as a gas or in solution is 500 pounds. \n\nThe City can store a maximum of 30,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine at the AWTP and 16,000 pounds at the BWCF.  No CALARP documentation is necessary for the sodium hypochlorite, an unregula"

In addition, the City stores a maximum of approximately 26,316 pounds of aqueous ammonia (19 percent) at the AWTP and 15,480 pounds at the BWCF and SWCF.  Chlorine storage and feed systems at the City's AWTP and BWCF qualify for a Program 3 Prevention Program.  However, the aqueous ammonia (19 percent) storage and feed systems at AWTP and BWCF qualify for a Program 2 Prevention Program, while the SWCF qualifies for a Program 1.  For each facility, if the worst-case release scenario for each aqueous ammonia (19 percent) process has no off-site impacts, then the aqueous ammonia (19 percent) feed systems could qualify for Program 1.  Copies of the RMP Registration forms for the AWTP, BWCF, and SWCF are included in Attachment ES-1.\n\nAccidental Releases During Past 5 Years\n\nThe City's water treatment facilities have not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\nProcess Safety Management Accident Prevention Program\n\nThe City's water treatment facilities are subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with its chlorine and aqueous ammonia (19 percent) systems.  The City has developed a PSM safety program to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  These PSM procedures are summarized in Sections 1 to 15.  The PSM safety program includes the following elements:\n\n* Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine and aqueous ammonia (19 percent) systems to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n\n* Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures.  All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n\n* Initial safety training and three-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n\n* Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same level of safety training that the City pro"

Revised versions of the City's EAPs are provided in Section 13.  The key elements of the Emergency Action Plan are as follows:\n\n* All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) is trained in the specific elements of the program.\n\n* The chlorine storage facilities are equipped with electronic gas detectors.  The gas detectors have an audible alarm and alert the City's central operations control room.\n\n* In the event of an IDLH release, or one deemed unmanageable by on-site personnel, the facility would immediately contact the City of San Buenaventura Fire Department.  The Fire Department would conduct emergency response and repair the leak.  City staff is trained in first aid procedures.  \n\nHypothetical Accidental Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical accidental releases.

In accordance with EPA's rule, hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed for both chlorine and aqueous ammonia (19 percent).  Worst-case release and alternate release scenarios are defined in Section 15. \n\nRMP*Submit Assessment\n\nUSEPA's RMP*Submit software was used to prepare an assessment for the City's water treatment facilities.  A copies of the RMP*Submit report for the AWTP and BWCF are provided in Attachments ES-2 and ES-3, respectively.  A RMP*Submit report for the SWCF was not required for chlorine due to the use of sodium hypochlorite.  The City will submit an electronic copy of the RMP*Submit reports to the USEPA."
