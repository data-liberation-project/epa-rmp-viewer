The Facility Policy\n    The owners, management, and employees of Lammers Feed & Seed Inc are committed ot the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire dept, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n2. Facility Information\n   - The primary activity at the facility is the storage of  fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 102,000 lbs in our two-12,000 gal storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi-load  holding 38,000 lbs.\n3. The worst-case scenario and the alturnative release scenario.\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or semi-load) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 56,000 lbs, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .67 miles.\n   b. The alturnative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a transfer hose.  the distance to the endpoint( pt. of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles. \n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safty Reqirements for the Storagew and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American national Standards Institute, Inc and the standards of the U>S> Occupational Saftteyand Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n    - There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years:\n    - have caused any de"

The emergency reponse program.\n    - The facility has:\n      a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance  with OSHA standard,  29 CFR 1910.38\n      b. provided  state and local authorities the emergency planning and community  right-to-know information as required under SARA Tittle  111 (EPCRA)\n     c.  a written emergency reponse program in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120 includingf pre-emergency planning and emplyee training.\n7.  Planned changes to improve safty.\n     Safty improvement is a on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluaations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia saftey recommendations for implementation at this time."
