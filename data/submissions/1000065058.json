      "SummaryText": " (Fluid Milk Processing). The facility is located in an area zoned for commercial and industrial use. The facility is near Highway 99, which runs approximately north and south through Modesto. Crystal Creamery is a family owned business that processes milk into fluid milk, powdered milk, and butter, and also packages fruit juices. Crystal Creamery purchased the facility in 1988. The facility has undergone significant modifications since 1988 and the majority of the ammonia refrigeration system components are less than 20 years old.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, CAS No. 7664-41-7, is used at the facility in two refrigeration systems (\"A\" and \"B\"). The \"A\" system contains approximately 19,112 pounds of ammonia and the \"B\" system contains approximately 20,079 pounds of ammonia. Both systems are classified as EPA Program Level 3 processes. The ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems. Chemical reactions are not involved in these processes.  For safety, an ammonia diffusion tank (ADT) receives any blow-off from pressure relief valves (PRVs). The refrigeration systems provide cooling to the cold storage rooms, milk silos, glycol chillers, and process areas.  The cold rooms are used to store product. Some of the \"A\" side milk silos are jacketed with ammonia coils and store refrigerated milk and fruit juice concentrate. Glycol chillers supply cooled liquid to processing units and other equipment for refrigeration of raw materials. The \"A\" system provides refrigeration for the liquid products operations. The \"B\" system provides refrigeration for powdered processing and other operations.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP requires a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. The Prevention Program elements include the following: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Compliance Audits, Inci"

      "SummaryText": "dent Investigation, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Hot Work Permit Program, Contractor Safety, Employee Participation,\n\nLockout/Tagout Program and Line Break Program.\n\n\n\nThe Kansas Avenue Dairy has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Kansas Avenue Dairy ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the systems are equipped with pressure relief valves on pressure vessels and most, if not all, locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped. These pressure relief valves are connected by manifold to a water-filled diffusion tank. Any ammonia vapor that is unintentionally released through pressure relief valves bubbles through water that absorbs the ammonia. Other safety features at the facility include:\n\n\n\n?    central computer monitoring and control system\n\n?    emergency shutdown systems\n\n?    component specific safety shutdowns that are independent of the central computer control system pressure relief valves are replaced every 5 years\n\n?    fire alarms and sprinkler system\n\n?    ammonia leak detection systems in the engine rooms and all process areas that contain ammonia equipment\n\n?    an ammonia fire dump system that can be used to relieve pressure in vessels\n\n?    a computerized preventive maintenance program\n\n?    all ammonia piping is color coded\n\n?    all ammonia piping, valves and components are labeled\n\n?    operators receive regular training on ammonia system maintenance, operation and emergency response\n\n?

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to: formal training programs for system operators and emergency responders, a hot work permit program, a lock-out/tag-out program, a contractor safety program, and a management of change program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been written for the ammonia systems at the facility and will provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\n\n\nKansas Avenue Dairy is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration systems. A computerized preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration systems. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly and periodic inspection, calibration, testing and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The computerized system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe RMP  requires a review of the 5-year accident history at the regulated facility. The history must include \"all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  There were no reportable releases at the facility in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event that an ammonia release that requires emergency response occurs at the facility, Kansas Avenue Dairy has trained refrigeration system operators for emergency response.
