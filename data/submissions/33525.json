Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nArgo-Tech Corporation, Costa Mesa, (ATCM) handles liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and sometimes butane, above threshold quantities.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle LPG and LNG, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.  Our policy is to have only trained personnel handle the materials.  Personnel are trained to follow safe handling procedures at all times.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with input from the Costa Mesa Fire Department and Police Department.  We conduct regular joint training and walk through inspections with the Fire Department to ensure communication and coordination.  Our policy is to work with the Fire Department during any type of emergency at this facility.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nATCM operates several divisions, one of which is the Cryogenic Pump Division.  This division manufacturers, assembles and tests submerged liquefied gas pumps.  The tests are conducted using LPG or LNG, along with nitrogen (LN2).  The Cryogenic test slab is the area of focus for the RMP.\n\nLPG and LNG are the regulated substances handled above threshold quantities.  LPG is stored in an 8,000 gallon above ground tank.  LNG is stored in one of two 12,000 gallon above ground tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors only.\n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility was designed and constructed in accordance with general safety standards, such as NFPA, Compressed Gas Association safe handling practices, Uniform Fire Code and other generally accepted practices.  All valves have backup valves in case one fails.  This redundancy provided safety i"

      "SummaryText": "n the mechanical operation of the system.\n\nFire prevention is accomplished by posting signs for authorized access and no smoking.  The facility has a water sprinkler deluge system constructed around the tanks, which is activated by an ultraviolet detection system to prevent fire from affecting the storage tanks.  There is also a hydrocarbon detection system in the test area to detect a release of LNG or LPG around the tanks, in the pits and around the flare.\n\n4.    Five year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years that resulted in death, injury, significant property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place or environmental damage.\n\n5.    The emergency response program:\n\nEmergency procedures are documented in the Argo-Tech Emergency Plan.  The fluids are transferred from one tank or tanker to another only during normal business hours.  Personnel would be on site to handle an emergency and to contact outside agencies should it become necessary.  Training has been conducted facility wide.  Evacuation drills are conducted annually.  The Costa Mesa Fire Department is aware of the emergency procedures and hazardous materials on site.  Joint training is also conducted with the fire department.  There is a security guard on duty 24 hours to oversee the facility and to notify authorities in case of an emergency after normal business hours.\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility has been operating in the same basic manner for over 30 years.  This facility was originally constructed in the 1960?s and 1970?s in accordance with NFPA 58 and 59A, California Administrative Code, Title 8, unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders and APT Standard 2510, Design and Construction of LP-Gas Installations.  There are planned changes to the facility at this time to improve safety, efficiency and methods of operation.\n\nWe have recently conducted a \"Lean Manufacturing\" event, which produced recommendations for efficiency.  At the same time we are reviewing "
