These responders are trained to handle potential releases of anhydrous ammonia. Specific on-site response plans for handling releases of anhydrous ammonia exist. The Emergency Response Team is well equipped with chemical sensing equipment, personal protective equipment, offensive and defensive strategy tools and equipment, radio communication, pre-determined response check lists for Incidental Command, first aid responders, EMT's and medical supplies. All Welch emergency response teams (fire, chemical and other emergency situations)use the Incident Command System.
