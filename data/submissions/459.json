The City of Covington (the City) has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe CWWTF treats and disposes of all sanitary waste discharged to the City Sewer System.  The facility utilizes four (4) 1-Ton cylinders (8,000 lbs.) of chlorine (a gas liquefied under pressure) in the wastewater treatment process.  The CWWTF handles 2.3 million gallons/day (MGD) and has a maximum load design of 3.6 MGD under National Pollutant Dishcarge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Number TN0020982.\n\nWorst Case:\nChemical and Amount Released:  2,000 lbs. of chlorine in 10 minutes inside the Chlorine Room.\nWeather Conditions:  77 F with a 3.4 mph wind in Class F atmospheric stability.\n\nThis release would impact the urban area around the CWWTF within a 0.9 mile radius and affect 85 residences, an industrial park and two (2) churches.\n\nAlternate Case:\nChemical and Amount Released:  2,000 lbs. of chlorine in 60 minutes inside the Chlorine Room.\nWeather Conditions:  77 F with a 6.7 mph wind in Class D atmospheric stability.\n\nThis release would impact the urban area around the CWWTF within a 0.1 mile radius and affect two (2) small businesses; no residents would be affected.\n\nThe CWWTF is in compliance with OSHA PSM and emergency action plan regulations, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 rules.  The regularly scheduled maintenance program is key to maintaining the CWWTF in good operation.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the CWWTF during the last five (5) ye"
