Anhydrous Ammonia, used as a refrigerant in the system, is considered a highly toxic chemical by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with a toxic threshold of 10,000 pounds.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe facility has one engine rooms, 17 controlled atmosphere rooms. These processes utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to\nfollow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program.
