      "SummaryText": "The Lubrizol plant in Louisville, Kentucky is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility located in the Rubbertown area. A portion of this plant, along with several in the vicinity, began operation in 1942 as a government-owned synthetic rubber facility. Thus, the name Rubbertown was established.\n\nFrom 1942 until February, 2001, the current Lubrizol facility was owned and operated by The BFGoodrich Company and from 2001 to 2004 by Noveon, Inc. Today, the facility operates as an integral part of Lubrizol Advanced Materials, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Lubrizol Corporation. Over 100 different products are produced at the Louisville facility. The latex unit supplies products consumed in paper coatings, automotive interiors, and non-woven cloth applications. The facility is the world\u00bfs largest producer of CPVC resins and compounds which are consumed in the manufacture of plumbing, fire sprinkler and industrial piping systems.\n\nThe plant utilizes five chemicals regulated under the EPA Risk Management program RMP Rule. These are vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, which are regulated as flammables, and chlorine and vinyl acetate, which are regulated as toxics. The systems required by the RMP to prevent serious accidents and to plan contingencies have long been in place at this facility. The relationship between excellent chemical safety programs and good business is well understood in the Lubrizol organization and is a core value in our operation. The RMP initiative provides us with an additional opportunity to expand our ongoing dialog with the community.\n\nThe Lubrizol Louisville facility is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the surrounding community, the environment and our employees. We are fully compliant with applicable laws and regulations, the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care initiatives and Lubrizol Health, Safety and Environmental Policies.\n\nThe Lubrizol Louisville facility has a comprehensive program for process sa"

All contract personnel must complete a Lubrizol Louisville-specific training class prior to entering the facility and annually thereafter.\n9.\tIncident Investigation \u00bf All incidents or near-miss incidents involving the release of hazardous chemicals are investigated by a multi-functional team of plant personnel including those involved in operating the process. These reviews involve a critique of the incident and any related plant systems. Corrective actions are developed and tracked to completion. A report documenting these reviews is developed and circulated throughout this facility and to other Lubrizol locations.\n10.\tCompliance Audits \u00bf Internal audits of our process safety management systems are conducted by Lubrizol personnel every 3 years. These audits review all systems and documentation thereof, verify process safety information and inspect the physical facilities.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that each company include a 5 year history of all accidental releases of RMP-regulated chemicals that resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage on-site; know off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. The Lubrizol Louisville plant has had no events that meet the criteria.\n\nThe Lubrizol Louisville facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Lakeland Dreamland Fire Department, the Rubbertown Mutual Aid Association, and other local response agencies. Plant personnel are trained annually on the plan and new employees are trained prior to working in process area. All operations personnel for the plant processes involving RMP-covered chemicals maintain 24-Hour Hazardous Material Technician certification to mitigate an accidental release.\n\nPersonal and process safety is integrated into every facet"
