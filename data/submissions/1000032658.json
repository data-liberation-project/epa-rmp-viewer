This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\r\n\r\n\tAcknowledge the operation of a source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\r\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the \u00bfgeneral duty clause\u00bf of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\r\n\r\n\tIdentify hazards\r\n\tDesign and maintain a safe facility\r\n\tPrevent releases\r\n\tMinimize consequences of releases.\r\nThe accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. YCEC has prepared and implemented its RMP of the aqueous ammonia system in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\r\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\r\nThe RMP applies to the YCEC facility located at:\r\n\r\n875 North Walton Ave., Yuba City, CA. 95993\r\n\r\nThis RMP does not apply to the Greenleaf 2 facility, which is covered by a site specific RMP, which addresses anhydrous ammonia issues.\r\nThe YCEC facility is a gas turbine based peaking power plant facility rated at 48.1 MW (nominal rating). The facility will consist of one (1) LM6000-PC eSprint gas turbine rated at 48.1 MW. The gas turbin"

The facility has \u00bfselective catalytic reduction (SCR)\u00bf system, on the turbine, for the control of oxides of nitrogen (Nox) emissions. Aqueous ammonia (19 percent solution) is used as the reaction reagent in the presence of a precious metal catalyst to complete the Nox emissions control process.
