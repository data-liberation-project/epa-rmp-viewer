The facility treats and cleans produced and ?frac? water from oil and gas fields in southwest Wyoming.  The stationary source of regulated substance is two (2) 12,150 gallon storage tanks of 37% hydrochloric acid (HCl) and associated piping.  If the tanks were filled to 100% capacity, the result would be a maximum of 24,300 gallons or 241,168 pounds of hydrochloric acid, which is above the EPA RMP threshold of 15,000 pounds.  Tanks will not be filled more than 90% of capacity (217,051 lbs. max).  HCL is separately introduced at different injection points along the water treatment system and never mixed with any other chemicals prior to injection into a 1 million gallon bioreactor tank, where it is used for pH control.  GE Water & Process Technologies has provided the facility a ZeeWeed Wastewater Treatment System designed to treat an average daily flow of 820 US gpm of wastewater to produce high quality water for discharge to a nearby river.  This wastewater treatment system consists of a Bioreactor for the ZeeWeed system; two (2) ZeeWeed trains, each with five (5) ZW 500D cassettes containing 48 modules; backpulse system; system Aeration equipment; clean In Place (CIP) equipment; chemical dosing equipment; reverse Osmosis (RO) pre-treatment equipment; two (2) singe pass, two-stage Reverse Osmosis (RO) units, each containing 85 membrane modules; and three (3) boron exchange pressure vessels.\n\nThe Jensen Facility Prevention Program complies with 40 CFR ?68 (Clean Air Act 112(r)) Risk Management Program 3, CFR ?29 1910.119 OSHA PSM rules, and is in compliance with 40 CFR ?112 SPCC Plan regulations.

Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n4. Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance; \n5. Training for all employees in relevant procedures; and\n6. Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the ERP to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that employees are informed of changes. \n\n\n\nWorst case scenario calculations were based upon storage tank failure resulting in a liquid spill and vaporization of 240,000 lbs. of HCl using RMP*Comp software. Per 2004 changes to the RMP reporting rule, the results of the offsite consequence are not provided in the Executive Summary.  The facility has no reportable spill history."
