Americold has developed their Risk Management Plan Process Safety Management (RMPPSM) Manuals to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report. Federal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours. State regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia. Americold interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone. All releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents. Any release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending on the location of the release. The General Manager and Maintenance are to be called if not on site for support. Releases less than 25 PPM s"

There are additional full time supervisory and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Supervisor that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia system on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately. An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. This team activity is the core of the prevention program.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility provides process freezing, short-term and long term storage of various food products. The facility is located in an industrial area of Monterey County on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Plant Refrigeration System. The total ammonia inventory in the process exceeds the Federal and State thresholds. The refrigeration system is a direct, closed loop, mechanical refrigeration system. The original facilities were built prior to 1958 and have been expanded and modified since then. The ammonia equipment is located both inside refrigerated rooms, equipment rooms and outside the facility.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. Since the system is interconnected all process inventory amounts were used for the worst case analysis that could fit in the largest vessel. NOTE It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition the system is separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community,"

The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\nKey objectives of Americold Prevention Program are briefly described below\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes, impact, terrorism, theft, etc.). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Americold. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements).\n\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation Elements.)\n\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. Americold certifies operators following completion of operator training and confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-today activities. Second, all Americold employees (direct h"

These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by the Management of Change Procedure. If a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Americold has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Americold's Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. Following completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review Elements.)\n\n7) Verification of Americold Logistics compliance with the RMPPSM program. This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Americold personnel. Americold has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)\n\n8) Minimize employee injury and illness.

Responders are also trained to the (300 PPM) Air Purifying Respirator level. Responders will assist outside agencies during larger releases. Responders will attempt to stay below the IDLH during mitigation but can enter. Detailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel. All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site. Small releases can be brought under control immediately. The emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and switches for the system with the release. If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate. The appropriate shut down switches are identified. The Federal and California Emergency Planning Regulations considered in this program include EPA's Risk Management Plan, OSHA's Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's Process Safety Standard,  EPA's Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Contingency Plan and Hazardous Materials Plan(HMBP) ?CCR Title 8 and Title19\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns at this facility. The prevention program has been updated as a result of recent addition changes of equipment. A PHA study was conducted at Americold and the study team made recommendations for additional safety. The following are targeted improvements to reduce accidental releases either in process or planned for at this time. Test diffusion tank water PH monthly or install sensor for central control system.
