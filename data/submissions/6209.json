These prepackaged containers include portable tanks, cylinders and drums.\n\nChlorine\n\nThis gas is packaged in steel cylinders of 2000 and 150 pound size. The product is delivered to the facility on trailers specifically designed to transport the containers.\n\nThe chemical is liquefied under pressure and release from the container is in the form of a gas. The cylinders are equipped with safety mechanisms to minimize the possibility of an accidental release and pressure relief devices are installed should the container be exposed to excessive heat from elevated temperature conditions such as that associated with a fire.\n\nChlorine is shipped off site in small quantities to water treatment facilities using the gas to treat water for the public's use.\n\nThe 150 pound containers are stored in secured racks to prevent accidental damage.
