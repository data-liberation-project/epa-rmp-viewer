Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:                                                                                     We at Jacobson Warehouse Company, Inc, along with our customer, Bayer MaterialScience, are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention practices that cover areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the storage and distribution processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release were to occur, trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  This includes the local Fire Dept.                                                                                                                                           2.

We have two substances present at our facility that are regulated under the EPA Risk Management Regulation.  The first substance , toluene diisocyanate, is used as a reactant in the manufacturing of flexible polyurethane foams and other elastomers.  No manufacturing of any type or processing of toluene diisocyante or any other chemical takes place at this facility.  The toluene diisocyante is stored in 55 gallon drums and the maximum inventory at our facility is 300,000 lb's.  The second is phosphorus oxychloride which is stored in 600 lb. steel drums.  There is also no manufacturing of this material at this facility.                                                                                                                                                                            3.

The closed containers are stored in accordance with the National fire Protection Agency (NFPA) codes.  Containers are inspected for the integrity when pulling orders for shipment and during the loading process.  In addition, the following elements of a release prevention program are in practice at our facility:  employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup reviews, mechanical integrity, safe work practices, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits.                                                                                                                                                                             4.  5 Year Accident History - Due to our stringent release prevention policies there has been no accidental release during the last 5 years.                                                                                                                                                                              5.  Emergency Response Plan - Our facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment evaluations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our facility that would require a modified emergency response.
