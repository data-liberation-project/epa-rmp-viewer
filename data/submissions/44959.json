      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Frozen Foods, which is owned by C.H. Guenther & Son, Inc., operates a food manufacturing facility in Duncanville, Texas, that prepares and freezes baked goods for commercial use.  This site was initially owned by Texas Custom Bakers and was acquired by C.H. Guenther & Son, Inc. in 1987.\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to Pioneer Frozen Foods because the plant handles and stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of threshold quantities.  The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods use anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in the freezers.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n-Purpose and General Duty Clause:  The essence of the general duty clause, ?112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Pioneer Frozen Foods is committed to ensuring the safe operation of their facility to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Pioneer Frozen Foods, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by coordinating with the local fire department.\n\n-Risk Management Plan:  The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods involves the handling and storage of one chemical, anhydrous ammonia, in excess of thresholds specified in ?112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of ?112(r), Pioneer Frozen Foods management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release, including maintaining a trained hazmat response team.\n\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Pioneer Froze"

      "SummaryText": "n Foods is in compliance with the OSHA PSM, EPA SPCC, OSHA HAZWOPER, EPCRA, and EPA RCRA Contingency Planning requirements.  Pioneer Frozen Foods has also conducted a process hazard analysis on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nPioneer Frozen Foods? original RMP submittal to EPA included two program level 3 processes involving anhydrous ammonia.  Pioneer Frozen Foods is submitting this submittal to update the original submittal and because the person who was responsible for the original RMP is no longer with the company and the files and documentation supporting the original RMP could not be located.  There is only one RMP-covered ammonia process at Pioneer Frozen Foods ? the Main System which holds an amount of anhydrous ammonia above the RMP threshold quantity.  The second process, Aero-Freezer #1 System, which was reported in the original RMP submittal, is below the threshold.  The third system, Aero-Freezer #2 System, added approximately three years ago, is also below the RMP threshold.  These latter two systems are separate from each other and from the Main system.\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios have been updated using EPA?s guidance document, Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities (May 2004), which replaced the guidance that was used for the original offsite consequence analysis, Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC (May 1996). \n\nPioneer Frozen Foods has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  Pioneer Frozen Foods maintains current operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures; a trained hazmat response team; and an evacuation plan for each area.  In addition, Pioneer Frozen Foods has coordinated emergency response with the local fire department since the LEPC does not have an active presence in the area where the facility is located.\n\nSeveral developments and findings have "

The upgrade to the alarm system allows the siren to be heard throughout the facility instead of just in designated areas. \n\nPioneer Frozen Foods? management is committed to the following:\n-Preventing accidents;\n-Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n-Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n-Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Pioneer Frozen Foods operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n-Being a good corporate citizen of Dallas County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about Pioneer Frozen Foods? management of the risks associated with operating the ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods.  Most important, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
