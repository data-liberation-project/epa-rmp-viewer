Safe handling of propane is dependent upon a number of factors, including the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures, and the continous training of our personnel. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to store and distribute propane to wholesale customers and AmeriGas retail locations. Propane is primarily used by our customers as a fuel. Propane is received by transport truck and rail cars, and stored in bulk storage tanks. Propane is distributed to wholesale customers and other AmeriGas locations by bobtails, transport trucks, and rail cars. This facility has specialized equipment for unloading and loading propane. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorizied contractors. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is propane.\n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this facility is 856,800 pounds. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario\n\nInformation concerning the worst-case scenario and alternative scenario for this facility are contained in the appropriate sections of the Risk Management Plan. \n\nEmergency Response Plan, Accidental Release Program and Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis AmeriGas propane storage and distribution facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable Federal, State, and local codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained using  the National Propane Gas Association's Certified Employee Training Program (CETP). The worst-case scenario and alternative scenario have an extremely small chance of occurring.
