      "SummaryText": "1.     Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and emloyees of UAP Northwest's facility on Highway 236, 17 miles West of Big Sandy, Montana are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity at the Kenolwith facility is the storage, and sale of Anhydrous ammonia to our customers.\n\n     The regulated substance, Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and sold for retail use at the remote site leased by UAP Northwest.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the site.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous ammonia handled at Kenolwith is 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.     The Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario.       Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.36 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario.       The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from reactor piping or hoses.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:    The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure "

      "SummaryText": "Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.     Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of Anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n     have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n     have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.     The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n     OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n     OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n     Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia storage or processes at the facility."
