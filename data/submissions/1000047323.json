Landus Cooperative's accidental release prevention policy involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the Iowa Fertilizer Law are adhered to.  The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\n2. The Landus Cooperative facility at Dike is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical panels and lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.\n\n\n\n3.
