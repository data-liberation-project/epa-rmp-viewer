Sara Lee Bakery's operations include the manufacturing of frozen bakery products for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names such as Sara Lee.  Sara Lee Bakery has been in operation at this facility for over 36 years providing quality bakery products and over 600 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSara Lee Bakery is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is Sara Lee Bakery's policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nSara Lee Bakery is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [Federal Department of Agriculture (FDA)] to ensure quality in the final products.  Sara Lee Bakery also operates freezers and coolers for product storage.  Sara Lee Bakery uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112\u00ae regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the  300,000+ ft2 facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for bakery  plants. Sara Lee Bakery's two refrigeration systems, consisting of receivers, c"

In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system itself is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, And Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems. \n\nSara Lee Bakery has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Sara Lee Bakery has trained approximately 20 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat team).\n\nSara Lee Bakery has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed at least annually by means of SOP review session(s).  Process safety information for the refrigeration system is periodically reviewed as well.  Sara Lee Bakery encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of Sara Lee Bakery newsletters and training sessions. Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Sara Lee Bakery, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employe"

The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using a computer maintenance management software system to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.\n\nTo ensure that Sara Lee Bakery's control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\nIn accordance with the PSM program, Sara Lee Bakery conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n \nIn addition, Sara Lee Bakery is audited by the local fire department on an annual basis.\n \nSara Lee Bakery's insurance carrier also conducts independent audits on an annual basis.\n \n \n Five-Year Accident History\n \n Over the last five years, Sara Lee Bakery has experienced only one minor on-site accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.\n \n \n Emergency Response Program\n \n Sara Lee Bakery has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release.  This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Sara Lee Bakery as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n \nSara Lee Bakery has trained"
