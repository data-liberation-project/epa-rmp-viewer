      "SummaryText": "The Hanson Cold Storage Co. - Lafayette Division facility located in Lafayette, Indiana is a cold storage warehouse that has a refrigeration system containing ammonia which is considered toxic by EPA. The primary purpose of this warehouse is to store products for various companies at either subzero temperatures or at refrigerator temperature to preserve and / or extend the life of the product.  Modernization in 1999 included replacement of the entire ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nAmmonia is used at the warehouse to refrigerate rooms to maintain a correct temperature as required by the customer.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the warehouse refrigeration system, providing the means to maintain specified temperature and / or remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the warehouse and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from rooms within the warehouse.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this warehouse.  \n\nThe warehouse refrigeration system was constructed using existing codes and standards including the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and is in compliance with state codes.  This cold storage warehouse complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nThe warehouse ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using various methods such as on the job training, equipment manufacturers training sessions, tapes and literature from the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Associ"

This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.    \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is computer operated with on-site and remote access for control of the system.  If an alarm should occur, and auto paging system contacts the operator.  An ammonia detection system is in place which alarms if ammonia is sensed and is linked to control the compressor room ventilation fan system as needed.  The ammonia refrigeration system is also protected by specific safety systems/hardware and safety cutouts including pressure, temperature and level control.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, and vessels from the hazards associated with overpressure.  \n\nThe process has numerous safe guards including:  \n\n\u00bf  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n\u00bf  Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts. \n\n\u00bf  The warehouse has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\n\u00bf  A process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in 2004.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n\u00bf  Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis f"

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n\u00bf  For warehouse projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\n\u00bf  Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are pre-qualified based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n\u00bf  The warehouse has a program for replacement of all pressure relief valves every five years.\n \nThe emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this warehouse.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The warehouse emergency action plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency action plan has been discussed with the Lafayette Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response. \n\nThe warehouse has had no reportable ammonia releases in the five year history."
