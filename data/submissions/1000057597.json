Resources used in the process was International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Guidelines, RMP Pro 98 Software by Dyadem and Cold Storage Technologies.\r\n\r\nReport organization includes; Certification statement, Summary, Detailed Elements and Map of  Potential Impact.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Imperial Valley Cooling LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Our new Cold Storage Facility is state-of-the A\u00bfart including the latest diffusion tank safety equipment providing neutralization of all Ammonia releases.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facilityA\u00bfs primary activities encompass Packing and storage of fresh fruit and Vegetables.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for Refrigeration.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. No specific unusual external events were included due to the facilities rural location, remote equipment location and recent construction meeting all applicable seismic and safety code"

      "SummaryText": "s. Potential impacts by forklift or other facility traffic typical to this type of operation were included. Any catastrophic type events would result in the same impacts as presented in this OCA or less. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  In this scenario 19939 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. No mitigation or administrative controls were used.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.52 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Circle population from census information is 4303 however the plume footprint would be approximately 10% of this value. This scenario does not represent a realistic scenario.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  The scenario involves the release of 300.00 lb. of vapor. The vapor is discharged from a failed compressor seal that can be isolated manually in 60 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nImperial Valley Cooling LLC maintains a detailed record of safety infor"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 1/01/16.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Imperial Valley Cooling LLC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nImperial Valley Cooling LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nImperial Valley Cooling LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 1/01/16.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Imperial Valley Cooling LLC.  The most recent review was performed on 1/01/16.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nImperial Valley Cooling LLC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 1/01/16.
