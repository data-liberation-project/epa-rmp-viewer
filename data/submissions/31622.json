There are two chemicals at the Farmers Valley plant that are subject to the RMP regulation: anhydrous ammonia and propane.\n \nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to cool the feedstock to the De-oiling Unit. The normal maximum inventory of ammonia is approximately19,000 pounds. Propane also is a colorless gas at atmospheric temperature and pressure. It is a flammable chemical with a vapor density of 1.52 (air = 1). Propane is used as a solvent to remove heavy resin from vacuum tower bottoms. The normal maximum inventory of propane is approximately184,000 pounds.\n\n3) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the Honeywell Farmers Valley plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.\n  \n3a. Process Safety Information\n\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for the processes that use ammonia and propane.  This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes.  The information compiled includes data on the safe use and handling of ammonia and propane (e.g. Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., process flow diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates, storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of the impact of exceedances), and data on the equipment used in the process (e.g. piping & instrument diagrams, materials compatibility, energy ratings and classification, control devices and emergency systems, ventilation systems, and design basis including conformance to applicable codes and standards). \n\n3b.

Training records are maintained for each employee to show the date training was conducted, the material covered by the training, and the means used to verify that the training was understood.\n\n3e. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant has a program to ensure the mechanical integrity of equipment used to process and handle ammonia and propane. This equipment includes pressurized vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency control devices, pumps and valves.  Written procedures have been prepared to define the scope and requirements of the mechanical integrity program.  Maintenance employees involved in carrying out the mechanical integrity program are trained to complete the required tasks in a safe manner.\n\nOne component of the mechanical integrity program includes inspection and testing of covered equipment.  Equipment inspection and testing is conducted in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Records of inspections and testing are maintained to show the date, equipment identification, inspector, type of test or inspection performed, and test results or observations. \n \nIf deficiencies are noted during equipment inspection and testing, corrective actions are taken in a timely manner to assure safe operation of the process.  In some cases, equipment inspections are driven by permit requirements as well as the mechanical integrity program. \n\n3f. Management of Change\n\nA management of change order is required when there is a change (except for replacement in kind) to equipment, process chemicals, technology, procedures, or a change to the facility that will affect a process that handles ammonia or propane.

Process and maintenance personnel are trained prior to start up of a modified process.\n\n3g. Pre-startup Review\n\nPrior to startup of a new or newly modified process involving ammonia or propane, a pre-startup safety review is conducted. The review is to ensure that the equipment and installation meets design specifications, a process hazard analysis has been completed, employee training has been completed, and safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place.\n \n3h. Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits for processes involving ammonia and propane are conducted every three years at a minimum to ensure that the elements of the general accidental release prevention program are up to date and are being implemented.  A team of employees having experience and knowledge of the covered processes, and knowledge of the program requirements conducts the compliance audits.  Records of the compliance audit reports are maintained to document the results of the audits and any corrective actions taken.\n\n3i. Incident Investigation\n\nAll incidents that resulted in or could have resulted in a release of ammonia or propane are investigated promptly.  The incident investigation starts with the completion of an Incident Investigation Report prepared by the supervisor on duty at the time of the incident. The report is distributed to the incident investigation team.  The incident investigation team is made up of employees having experience and knowledge of the processes affected by the incident, and knowledge of incident investigations.  \n \n\nFollowing the incident investigation, a report is prepared to include the following information: (a) date, time, and location of the incident; (b) employees involved in the incident, and their roles; (c) date of the incident investigation; (d) names of employees on the incident investigation team; (e) desc"

A team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process design and operation, and knowledge of how to complete a process hazard analysis performs each process hazard analysis.  The management of change process (described below) is used to track and document process changes, which occur as a result of recommendations from process hazard analyses.\n \n\n3c. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are prepared for all processes at the facility, including those using ammonia and propane. The operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the plant.  The procedures are updated to reflect current operating practices, and are certified annually for accuracy.\n\nSpecific information and instructions covered by the operating procedures include startup, normal operation, emergency operation, shutdown, operating limits, operating controls, chemical-specific health and safety information, required personal protective equipment, and use of safety systems.

Contractors\n\nPrior to retaining contractor services for work in ammonia and propane units at the Honeywell Farmers Valley plant, the contractor's safety program and performance are evaluated.  This evaluation includes a 3-year review of the contractor's Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), review of OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses, review of Lost Work Day Cases Away (LWDCA), corrective actions, safety policies, training and medical monitoring, and review of any applicable site-specific health and safety plan (HASP) prepared by the contractor.  The information supplied by the contractor is retained on site while the contractor is engaged in work activities.\n \nPrior to commencing work on site, each contractor employee receives a safety orientation provided by Honeywell.  The safety orientation covers information on the hazards associated with the process areas where the work will be performed, safety procedures and systems to be used, overview of the site emergency response program including specific procedures to be followed in case of emergency, and a review of site safety rules and applicable operating procedures.  A record of each contractor employee's sign-off on the safety orientation is maintained on file at the site, including the date the training was completed.  Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible to ensure that each contractor employee performs the assigned work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation.  If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on site.
