Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility \n\nThe coop board, management and employees of Watonwan Farm Service, Clarks Grove, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be approximately 240,000 pounds in our 3-18,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding approximately 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all tank equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections.   Visual checks are to be conducted daily. \n\n4.  The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have: \n\n1. Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or \n2. To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.
