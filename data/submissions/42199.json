      "SummaryText": "The City of Worcester's Department of Public Works  and Parks (DPW & P) has developed a unified accidental release prevention program at its Worcester Water Filtration Plant (WWFP).  The plan covers all aspects of the program 2 requirements under the United States Environmental Protetion Agency (USEPA) 40 CMR 68.  The WWFP has documented a Risk Management Plan for hazard identification, prevention and emergency response.  This plan is coordinated with the regional Hazmat team, Local Emergency Planning Committees of the City of Worcester and the Town of Holden and the Fire Departments of both municipalities.  Chlorine leak simulation drills are conducted yearly to coordinate the WWFP facility Emergency Response Plan into the City of Worcester's \"Integrated Hazardous Material Incident Response Plan\".  The WWFP has been providing the City of Worcester with high quality drinking water since its opening on 1/9/97.  The WWFP is located at 71 Stonehouse Hill Road in the Town of Holden on the shores of Holden Reservoir #2.  Chlorine gas is used at the WWFP for final disinfection of the drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The chlorination process includes a chlorinator room, scale room and chlorine storage room.  The maximum storage of the chlorine facility is 30,000 pounds.  Chlorine is received in one ton cylinders containing liquid Chlorine.  Only chlorine gas is released from the cylinders.  Chlorine gas is then mixed with water and is injected at a dose of approximately 2.5 pounds per million gallons.  The facility averages 22 Million Gallons per day.  The facility is manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week by state certified drinking water operators.  The chlorine process is inspected at least twice a day and chlorine gas leaks can be detected instantaneously with the use of chlorine leak detectors located within the treatment plant.  The chlorine alarm system alerts operators on duty both visually and audibly throught the facility.  The chlorine l"

The chlorine leak alarms will also automatically shut down all of the one ton cylinders at the chlorine tank valve.  The fire departments of both Worcester and Holden will respond to a chlorine emergency.  The RMP coordinates the proper response from the operator in charge, the fire departments and LEPC's of both municipalities and the regional Hazmat team which is located in Worcester.  In the event of a chlorine leak the operators on duty are first responders.  The regional Hazmat team is the primary responders due to their training and available equipment.  In the event of a fire the Worcester Fire department is the primary responder because the Tatnuck Fire Station is the closest fire station to the WWFP.  The two municipalities developed a mutual aid agreement before the WWFP was completed.  \n     The offsite consequence analysis of the RMP includes the \"worst case release\" and the more realistic \"alternative release\".  The \"worst case release\" is defined by thew USEPA as the maximum quantity in the largest vesell which is released in 10minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The USEPA model, RMP Comp, was used to determine the distance to the safe endpoint.  The affected area reported using this model is very likely an overestimate of the affected area because the model uses weather conditions not representative of the area and does not take into account wind direction and topography.  This scenario also dictates a catastrophic failure and complete release of an entire one ton cylinder in 10 minutes, which is highly unlikely.  The maximum distance to the safe endpoint is 0.9 miles from the chlorine storage facility.  This would affect less than 300 people and only one public receptor.  The population was determined using the City of Worcester's GIS system, which located effected residential homes and used the City plannning number of individuals per home to deter"

Cascade Park is located between Mower Street and Cataract Street and is a passive recreation area consisting of hiking trails with no associated playgrounds area.  The municipal reservoir system of Holden #1 and Holden Reservoir #2 are environmental receptors.  No public recreation is allowed in these reservoirs co there would be no public impact.  The third environmental receptor is Cook's Pond.  About a third of Cook's Pond is in the affected area.  Cook's Pond is operated by a private lake association, which does allow recreation to members.  \n     A more realistic event is the \"alternative release\".  This event is an accidental breakage or failure of a flexible chlorine line under pressure.  The maximum flow from this event would be trough a 5/16\" valve opening.  This flow calculates to be 10 pounds per minute according to the Chlorine Institute.  The chlorine valve is designed using Chlorine Institute specifications.  Assuming the leak can not be repaired, the maximum release would be 6000 pounds, which is the weight of three chlorine cylinders hooked to the same chlorine gas header.  Therefore the release time would be 600 minutes.  This release time would more than likely reduced to less than 200 minutes by the actions of the regional Hazmat team.  Even if the leak could not be repaired the affected area would be 0.1 miles from the chlore storage area.  No residents or public receptors are located in this area.\n     The DPW prevention program includes the following key elements to prevent a chlorine gas leak from the WWFP.  Operators at the WWFP are trained to prevent chlorine gas releases by understanding the associated chlorination equipment and chlorine leak detectors.  The chlorine leak detectors are tested once per month to insure they operate correctly in the event of an actual chlorin"

The operators are trained and competant in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and have knowledge of the chemical principles of chlorine.  The operators always work in pairs using SCBA's whenever chlorine cylinders are chnaged or a shipment of chlorine cylinders are received from the chemical supplier.  These Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) along with preventative maintenance of the chlorine equipment greatly reduce the possibility of  an accidental chlorine gas release.  Additional mitigation equipment has been installed in the chlorine scale room.  Automatic chlorine shutoff valves have been added to all six cylinders that are actively in use in the scale room.  If a chlorine gas leak occurs, the chlorine gas leak detectors will send a signal to shutoff all six chlorine cylinders in less than one minute.  Therefore only only a failure of the chlorine cylinder or fusable plug can cause a chlorine gas leak of any length of time.  This would effect only one one ton cylinder.  Ther have been no reportable gas leaks in the operation of the WWFP since the plant opened on 1/9/97.  \n     The WWFP has initiated a hazard review of the equipment and response progrom in 1999.  The program was reviewed by the USEPA on 11/18/99.   The response program is coordinated with the Worcester DPW, Local LEPC's of the Town of Holden and the City of Worcester, the fire departments of both municipalities and the regional Hazmat team using the City of Worcester's Emergency Respones Plan.
