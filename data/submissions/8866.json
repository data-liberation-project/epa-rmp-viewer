We supply farmers with crop protection herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, seeds, fertilizers and professional consultation and custom application. Most of the products we warehouse and sell are similar to products consumers can buy in garden stores, just in larger quantities. However some are more hazardous and require special attention. The only product we store in sufficient quantities to require an RMP is Anhydrous Ammonia, a nitrogen product that farmers apply to fertilizer corn.  We have a long-standing safety record in the handling of ammonia with no accidents in more than 5 years. We take our responsibility as a safe handler of Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) very serious. We are a member of our community and strive to keep it safe from all environmental hazards. Along the line of safety we have developed policy and procedures for the safe handling of NH3. I'll attempt to summarize them here.\n\nReceipt of NH3 truck transports: \n* Chock wheels before connecting hoses\n* Inspect truck & hoses for visual signs of potential problems\n* Inspect connections from hoses to storage vessel \n* Inspect valve's for correct position to unload semi's\n* Begin pumping from truck to vessel\n* Check % full gauge and pressure gauge\n* Fill storage vessel only to 85% full\n* When transfer is completed reverse above order.\n* Insure the hoses and chocks are removed before releasing truck  \n\nTransfer & filling of field nurse wagons: \n* Locate and understand the use of personal protective & emergency response equipment. PPE to include neoprene gloves, goggles, face shield, long sleeve shirt, pants and closed toe work boots. Emergency response equipment to include 2 full face breathing apparatus w/ NH3 canister. Do not take emergency response equipment to the loading stands with you. \n* Locate & check volume of 150-gallon water bath at the l"
