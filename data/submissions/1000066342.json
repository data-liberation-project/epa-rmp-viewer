The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) used on site. The AUC facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community. AUC's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the \"One Plan\".\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAUC repackages chlorine into U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks (commonly known as ton containers). In addition, AUC manufactures 10.5% and 12.5% by weight sodium hypochlorite. Sulfur dioxide U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks are stored at the site for distribution. The facility includes a private sidetrack for unloading railcars. A production building, with an emergency scrubber, is used for packaging the cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks. The sodium hypochlorite manufacturing and quality control testing are performed in the sodium hypochlorite lab building, with sodium hypochlorite production tanks, also connected to the scrubber, just outside of the lab building within the dedicated aboveground storage tank containment. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detection system continuously monitors all production and storage locations. The emergency shutdown system and scrubber may be manually activated by an employee or automatically by the gas detection system.  Based upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk "

Compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29 CFR ?1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (40 CFR ?68),\n\n?    Implementation of the National Association of Chemical Distributors Responsible Distribution Code,\n\n?    Operator Function Specific and Emergency Response Training,\n\n?    Employee Hazardous Communication and Personal Protective Equipment Training,\n\n?    Preventative maintenance schedule,\n\n?    Use of Chlorine Institute and Compressed Gas Association recommended equipment,\n\n?    Use of effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators, facility managers and corporate managers,\n\n?    Performance of a process hazard analysis,\n\n?    Implementation of a three year program internal auditing program.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo deaths, evacuations, recordable injuries and/or shelter in place do to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the last five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan, which has been reviewed and updated in AUGUST 2013 (with an additional review and emergency contact information update in APRIL 2017). The plan includes the following elements:\n\n?    description of chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes,\n\n?    recommended first aid for chlorine and sulfur dioxide exposures,\n\n?    a list of all emergency equipment onsite and where such equipment is located,\n\n?    list of onsite and offsite emergency response personnel and contact numbers,\n\n?    detailed description of company personnel,\n\n?    emergency and non-emergency contact numbers,\n\n?    procedures for reporting and handling the releases,\n\n?    site and evacuation plans,\n\n?    procedures for plan review and update as well "
