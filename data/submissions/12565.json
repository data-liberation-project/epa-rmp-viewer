      "SummaryText": " The City of Liberty Wastewater Treatment Facility is located in an unpopulated area. However worst case and alternate scenarios show that if a release occurred it would impact the public.  The City has  reviewed the operations at the facility and will make recommendations for mitigation projects, to reduce the risk of the public, should a release occur.  The facilties emergecny response policies fall under the City's Division of Emergency Management. All responses and actions will be conducted by using the City's Emergency Operations Plan. The facilty is checked daily for any deficiencies in the systems. The facility has in operation  one ton cylinders of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. This usually lasts thirty days before the cylinders are changed. The worst case scenario for Chlorine is a 10 minute duration at 200 pounds a minute. The surroundings are urban. Estimated distance to toxic end point is 1.3 miles. This scenario is also the same for the Sulfur Dioxide. A worst case scenario release would affect a major highway, schools, hospital, government facilties and other area in the the business district.  The majority of valving and piping is either enclosed in a building or located underground. The cylinders themselves are outdoors. Alternate scenarios for both chemicals are at a 20 minute release at 100 pounds per/min. The toxic endpoint would be 2/10 th's of a mile and would not affect populated areas. The facilty follows rules set by OSHA, EPA, and state agencies as they relate to acccdental release prevention and chemical prevention steps.  The facility has no accidental release in the past five years.  The emergency response program is based on safety and accountabilty. Employees are to activate the emergency response plan whenever a release occurs. The Liberty Fire Dept. is the primary Hazardous Material Response Team that will respond.  The fire department has trained on simulated leaks at the facilty. This includes using Cholorine cylinder kits.  Public n"
