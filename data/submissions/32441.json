      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe City of Bartow Water Treatment Facility owned and operated by the City of Bartow is the major water treatment plant for the community.  An integral component of the treatment plant is chlorine (Cl2) used for water disinfection.  The Cl2 storage capacity of the facility is 24,000 pounds.  This inventory exceeds the 2,500-pound threshold for Cl2 set by EPA under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule codified at 40 CFR 68.  Pursuant to the requirements of the rule, the City of Bartow has prepared this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan. We are proud of our environmental, health, and safety efforts and programs and our record in these areas.  The following sections outline our RMP plan.   \n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nOur Director of Water has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Director of Water has assumed the role of RMP Coordinator.  The RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements.  In addition, the RMP Coordinator works closely with the Chief  Operator at the Water Treatment Facility to integrate the elements of OSHA's PSM program (where applicable) as required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\nThe RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's RMP Steering Committee.  This committee comprises members with responsibilities for developing and managing specific elements of our risk management and process safety programs.  The members of this committee are assigned by the Director of Water.  Currently, the members of the RMP Steering Committee include the following: \n\n *  RMP Coordinator (Director of Water)\n *  Senior Operator of the Water Treatment Facility\n *  Purchasing Agent (City of Bartow)\n\nThe following"

The Director of Water also is responsible for ensuring that the accident history for each covered process is appropriately documented and maintained in accordance with Section 68.42 and 68.168 of the RMP rule.\n\nThe rule requires the evaluation of a worst case scenario, even though the likelihood of the occurrence of such a scenario may be extremely small.  The worst case scenario has been defined as a catastrophic release of one entire Cl2 tank containing 2,000 pounds.  The distance to the toxic endpoint as predicted by the EPA RMP Guidance for Water Treatment Plant Reference Tables is 3.0 miles.  In addition to the worst case scenario, an alternative release scenario has been modeled employing more appropriate meteorological conditions and release assumptions.  In the alternative release scenario, 9 pounds of Cl2 per minute are assumed to be released as a result of a valve failure.  A 15-minute release would be expected in such a scenario.  Based upon these assumptions, the distance to the endpoint as predicted by the RMP Guidance is 0.33 miles (1,760 feet).  At these distances, residences may be impacted.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Water Treatment Facility has had a reportable releases of Cl2 on 5-3-04.  The release was caused by human error not the failure of storage vessels or equipment.  The 140# gaseous chlorine release resulted in zero injuries and deaths with zero offsite consequences the chlorine gas remained onsite.  However, approximately $20,000 damage was susta"

The Director of Water has the responsibility of ensuring that all of this information is readily accessible for use.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, the Director of Water has the responsibility for ensuring that process hazard analyses (PHAs) are scheduled, conducted, and documented by the Director of Water.  The Director of Water also uses outside contractors/consultants to lead PHAs when appropriate.  The Director of Water is responsible for (1) ensuring that the information and personnel necessary to conduct PHAs are available according to the PHA implementation schedule and (2) resolving recommendations that are assigned to their respective areas.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP rule, the Director of Water has the responsibility for ensuring that complete and accurate operating procedures are in place for all regulated processes.
