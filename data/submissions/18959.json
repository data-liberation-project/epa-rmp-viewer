We have Safety, Training and Emergency Action Plans in place for our employees. We coordinate emergency respones for accidental releases of chemicals with the Bloomfield Fire Department and the Davis County Sheriff. We have looked at the off-site consequences of releases from the ammonia tank and have determined that under the Worst and Alternate Case Scenarios, material would travel 1.8 and 1.6 miles respectively to the toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million.\n.\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nFacility:    Farmers Co-OP Association, Brighton, IA\nContact:     Dennis Blakely\nPhone:        319-694-2481\n\n1. Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Farmers Co-Op Association, Brighton, IA (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. Propane is sold at retail. The maximum quantity of ammonia stored is 76,500 pounds. The maximum quantity of propane stored is 94,350 pounds.\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    Ammonia - The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as l"

The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.1miles.  \n\n                        Propane - The worst case release would be as an explosive vapor cloud to an end point of 1.0 pounds per square inch (psi). The release would be to a distance of 0.4 miles.\n\nb.    Ammonia  - The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.  \n\n                        Propane - The alternate case would be a transfer hose failure with a duration of two minutes for a release of 69 pounds to the 1.0 psi end point. The distance would be 0.03 miles.\n \n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b. Also used in the review was National Fire Protection Association Code NFPA 58, 2nd Edition.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of  anhydrous ammonia or propane\nin the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OS"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia and  propane for implementation at this time."
