This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe South Charleston site is a manufacturing facility that annually produces many different specialty chemicals. Most are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The North Charleston Distribution Terminal receives propylene oxide by barge, which is off-loaded into two Union Carbide Corporation-owned spheres for distribution to the South Charleston facility. While the storage spheres are owned by Union Carbide Corporation, the propylene oxide within is partially owned by both Union Carbide Corporation and Covestro. To take the most conservative approach, Union Carbide Corporation has included the total quantity of propylene oxide in the spheres in the maximum inventory calculation.  There is an inter-company demarcatio"

Further, there are additional demarcations downstream of Covestro-owned equipment where they supply propylene oxide to plants owned by Union Carbide Corporation. \n\nThe South Charleston site has two covered Processes, four Programs, and three regulated substances present at the stationary source.  The regulated substances are listed below:\nAllyl Alcohol\nEthylene Oxide Propylene Oxide\n\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection\n\nWhere worst and alternate case scenarios impacted additional receptors, all scenarios were included in the submittal. There is one (1) worst case toxic and four (4) alternative case toxic scenarios in this submittal. \n\nAll scenarios were modeled using the RMP*Comp Tool with the exception of the propylene oxide WCS as the parameters for this scenario exceeded RMP*Comp capability.  As such, PHAST software was used to model the propylene oxide WCS.\n\nREVISIONS TO THE PLAN\nRevisions to the June 5, 2019 plan are being submitted for the following reasons:\n\nAcquisition of the North Charleston Distribution Terminal propylene oxide assets.\nThe Union Carbide Corporation completed an acquisition of two propylene oxide spherical tanks and barge off-loading equipment.  This process is now included in Union Carbide Corporation Risk Management Plan.\n\nProcess Boundary and Maximum Inventory Verification.\n\nUpon verification of RMP-covered process boundaries, it was determined that the Ethylene Oxide Distribution, Oxide Adducts, and Triton process were interconnected through ethylene oxide piping.  As such, this submittal contains two processes, South Charleston Plant and NCDT.\nMaximum inventories were updated to include material up to inter-company demarcation points and newly acquired propylene oxide process at NCDT.\n\n\n\nChanges were made to Section 1 to reflect updates to Owner or Operator and number of fulltime equivalent employees on site.

This operation also includes barge unloading, for which a predictive worst-case scenario was considered.  Although not our typical shipment, the largest amount in a barge could be five (5) million pounds.  The worst-case scenario was based upon catastrophic failure of this largest vessel. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSouth Charleston Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nUCC\u0092s general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA\u0092s PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System. Key elements include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses include:\nChecklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical\nExposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings"

Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\n\nThe South Charleston facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition to the on-site emergency squad, Dow has Distribution Emergency Response Teams throughout the United States that are available to distribution emergency within our area. \n\nKanawha Putnam EPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe continue to implement projects to improve process safety as opportunities are identified via external regulatory changes and/or internal process safety program changes or evaluations.  The South Charleston site was re-certified as an OSHA VPP STAR site in 2018. The West Virginia Operations Site also works with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure full compliance with the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard."
