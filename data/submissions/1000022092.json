The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  CSM Bakery Products has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  \n\nSteps to Improve Safety: CSM Bakery Products is taking a hands on approach to enduring the safety of their employees and community.

      "SummaryText": "The CSM Bakery Products plant produces and distributes frozen un-iced, finished cakes and cookies.   The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature for storing product until distribution.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a pressure vessels, evaporators, compressors, piping and other refrigeration equipment.\n\t\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  CSM Bakery Products is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.110 and EPA's Risk Management Program Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, there programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency action steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario: Worst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, RMP* Comp and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: As a part of the PSM program, CSM Bakery Products has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  There programs include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Cha"
