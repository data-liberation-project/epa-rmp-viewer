Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  \r\nHuntsman's Freeport Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  The Huntsman Freeport Plant maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, that implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman's Freeport Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  \r\n\r\n2.  Regulated Substances. \r\nHuntsman's Freeport Plant is located within the boundaries of the DOW Freeport Plant A facility.  The Freeport Plant produces various ethyleneamines which are sold to other companies for processing to a final consumer product.  There are three (3) regulated substances at the Freeport facility.  They are all on the toxic substances list and are:\r\n* Ethylenediamine (EDA) - Final product.\r\n* Ammonia (anhydrous) - Raw material.\r\n* Ammonia (aqueous) - Raw material.\r\n\r\n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis  \r\nEPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule requires that offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  \r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\r\nThe worst case scenario is based on EPA required assumptions, is highly unlikely, and has never occurred at this facility.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario"

This worst case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Release Scenarios  \r\nPer the RMP requirements, alternative scenarios were developed and reported for each of the three (3) toxic substances.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is a tank leak resulting in the release of ammonia.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  Mitigation considered for this scenario includes emergency shutdown systems, fixed water monitors and administrative controls.\r\n\r\nThe alternative case scenario for aqueous ammonia is a pipe leak resulting in the release of ammonia.  This alternative case scenario has the potential to affect offsite receptors.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMitigation considered for this scenario includes emergency shutdown systems, fixed water monitors and administrative controls.\r\n\r\nThe alternative case scenario for EDA is a pipe leak resulting in the release of EDA.

General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Freeport Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \r\n\r\n* Process Safety Information\r\nHuntsman's Freeport Plant maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\r\n* Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) that disc"

The PHAs also address consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility or stationary source siting, human factors and a qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. The Freeport Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Freeport Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards, which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. The Huntsman Freeport  Plant will complete a PHA Revalidation every 5-years meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Operating Procedures\r\nHuntsman Freeport Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associa"
