Highway 10 in St. Cloud, Minnesota was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the International Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 13,470 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock, blast freezer, and cooler/freezer storage. The majority of System #1 is located in the"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Appert's Foodservice to prevent the accidental release of ammonia at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that the Appert's Foodservice employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system, System #1, has been designed with several s"

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors for System #1 which are located in the Distribution Engine Room which activates the audible/visual alarm and turns the exhaust fan on at low level and in the refrigeration spaces which activates the audible/visual alarm at low level.  The ammonia sensors will alert operators of an ammonia leak.  The refrigeration contractor is notified in the event that an ammonia sensor is triggered.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n- On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\r\n\r\nBased on the above definition, at the time the Process Hazard Analysis was conducted revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (December 2006 - December 2011). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\n\r\nThe Appert's Foodservice facility has an emergency response plan in effect.

To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.

This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\r\n\r\nThe Appert's Foodservice facility is non-responding, and the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, performed on December 10-11, 2011, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Appert's Foodservice facility located in St. Cloud, Minnesota.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Appert's Foodservice facility is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.
