More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency action plans, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFrontier Ag maintains and operates our NH3 plant in strict accordance with all State and Local regulations. The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply promptly with their requests for improvement.\n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses goggles and gloves as well as having adequate safety water during all operational procedures. With this in mind it makes it easy to report that there have been absolutely no injury accidents or property damage for the past five years. \n\nOur Emergency Action Plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public and the area First Responders. Frontier Ag provides plant tours for our local fire department and our emergency action plan has been shared with the county Local Emergency Planning Commision(LEPC). Each of our responding agencies are aware of the dangerous nature of anhydrous ammonia and they have agreed to assist us in the event of an emergency or accidental release.\n\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our Local First Responders as an on-going training program.
