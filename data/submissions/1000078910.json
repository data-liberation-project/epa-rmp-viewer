This has not changed from the 2014 RMP.  \r\n\r\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for the Institute Site remains unchanged from the 2014 RMP submittal, with exception of changing the quantity of ethylene oxide released from 180,000 lb to 184,000 lb.  This is due to discussions with operations that current cars on site have as much as 182,000 pounds and that 184,000 pounds is conservative.   An additional public receptor was added to include churches which are within the distance to endpoint for the worst-case scenario and checked the box for toxic worst case scenario to include National or State Parks, Forests or Monuments for the inclusion of Kanawha State Forest, which is within this distance. This change did not result in an increased distance to endpoint, but rather due to improved mapping tools. \r\n\r\nChanges were made to Section 1 to reflect changes in Owner or Operator, person responsible for RMP implementation, Emergency Contact, Parent Company web site address, and number of fulltime equivalent employees on site.  Also, a change was made to the longitude and latitude coordinates from a central location to the plant entrance.\r\n\r\nThe flammable worst case scenario and flammable alternate worst case scenario for POLYOX was removed from the plan, as UCC no longer owns the POLYOX plant.  No other flammable scenarios exist within UCC ownership on site.\r\n\r\nSection 7, Program numbers 3 and 5 for CELLOSIZE and POLYOX, respectively, have been removed per discussion above. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nUCC facilities at the Institute site have had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no significant releases with offsite impact as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nUnion Carbide's gene"
