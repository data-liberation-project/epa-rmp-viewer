Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Meeder Equipment Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the company is prepared to notify and work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan is developed and would be implemented by the facility in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary business of the facility is the storage and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (propane).  Access to the site is restricted to authorized personnel.  This facility was determined to meet the RMP Program [3] criteria.\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the NFPA-58, state and local codes.\n\n4.  Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nFailure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount [85?]% at [60?]F would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  It is assumed that the entire tank contents are released as a vapor which finds an ignition source.  Ten [10] percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in a resulting explosion.  The endpoint used is 1 PSI overpressure.  According to EPA's reference tables or equations, the distance to the endpoint is [.4] miles.  There is an estimated residential population of [0] within distance to the endpoint.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or accidents involving propane in the past year that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, or caused any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering on place property damage, or environmental d"

Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the local fire department, or other authorities, to request a response to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the local fire department, or other authorities, to coordinate such a response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSafety is an on-going process at the facility and periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Employees at the facility receive training on safety, proper loading and unloading procedures, and the location of emergency shut-off switches/valves and procedures to take for closing such switches/valves in the event of an accidental release of propane."
