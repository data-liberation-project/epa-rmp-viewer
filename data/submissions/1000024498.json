      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of Dyno Nobel to conduct its business in a socially responsible manner, to provide a safe and healthful work environment for its employees, to protect the environment, and to preserve corporate assets. Management at all levels, is responsible and accountable for compliance with this policy. In observing this policy Dyno Nobel will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and corporate guidelines relating to health, safety, and environmental quality; evaluate the impact on safety, health and environment when developing new products, processes, and operating facilities; facilitate material recycling, waste minimization, and energy conservation; and work constructively with government agencies, community organizations and other interested parties in the fulfillment of corporate responsibility.\r\n\r\nDyno is a chemical manufacturer which produces and distributes nitric acid, ammonium nitrate liquid, and ammonium nitrate prill out of its Donora, Pennsylvania plant.  Major processes at the facility include storage of raw materials, weak nitric acid production, liquid ammonium nitrate production, and ammonium nitrate prill production.\r\n\t\r\nThe Donora Plant operates under SIC Code 2873 (NAICS Code 325180).  The facility is comprised of administrative/maintenance buildings, an acid plant complex, an ammonia storage complex, and a bulk prill complex all situated on a 31.5 acre parcel of land. The entire facility is fenced with locked gates, and the main entrance to the plant is supervised by a scale house attendant 24 hours per day.  Plant operators/supervisors monitor the entire plant 24 hours per day via closed circuit television cameras located throughout the plant.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located near the intersection of Scott Street and Galiffa Drive in the city of Donora, Washington County, Pennsylvania.  The plant is situated on the west bank of the Monongahela River at mile marker 35.9 LDB. The site is bounded on the north by Air Liquide Company, on the"

      "SummaryText": "west by Norfolk Southern Railway Company railroad tracks, on the south by Elliott Support Services, and on the east by the Monongahela River. \r\n\r\nThe major raw ingredient for the production activities at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is also subject to OSHA's PSM regulations. There are 2 covered processes at this facility which involve anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nProcess 1 -  Ammonia Storage and Unloading. This process is comprised of the facilities required to receive ammonia into the facility and to store the ammonia for processing to manufacture nitric acid and ammonium nitrate. Ammonia may be received into the facility by barge, rail car and occasionally by tanker truck. Low temperature anhydrous ammonia is transported by barge and is unloaded into a low temperature storage tank. The low temperature storage tank has an administrative fill limit of 90% and a dike for passive mitigation. High pressure ammonia is received by tank cars and unloaded into two high pressure storage tanks. An administrative maximum fill limit of 80% with a normal operating limit of 60% exists for the high pressure storage tanks.\r\n\t\r\nProcess 2 - Ammonia Oxidation Process. Ammonia is transferred from storage in the ammonia oxidation process to produce nitric acid. Nitric acid is further reacted with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate solution. \r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to Program 3 requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions because the anhydrous ammonia exceeds the RMP threshold quantities and are also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This RMP has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program is integrated into the Donora Plant's Process Safety Management Program and the Integrated Contingency Plan. Employees are annually trained in basic emergency response procedures.  The Donora plant routinely participates in information exchanges and drills with local emergency responder"
