      "SummaryText": "The Conaway Wastewater Treatment Plant is a POTW. The plant treates domistic sewer with no industrial discharges to it. The plant uses Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide in the disinfection process. We have Chlorine in 1ton cylinders and Sulfur Dioxide in 150 lb cylinders. It is fed through vaccum regulators in gas form to rate control valves and into vaccum injectors and water mix. Both the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are fed in the same way. The gases are housed in seperate enclosures in the control building. Each room has low level leak detection with audible alarms on site. The alarm also calls our main computer that is maned 24 hour a day 7 days a week. The plant is maned 16 hours a day 7 days a week with on call personal 24 hours. On call personal will check any off hour alarms to verify them. The plant is located in a remote location of the county with little population and a very mountainous terrain. We have 5 to 10 people living in our worst case end point. Due to the terrain they may not be affected by a release due to the tendencies of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide to go to low points. All employes are trained in safe handling of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide. All cylinders are secure and emergency repair kits are on site for both ton and 150 lb cylinders. The systems are checked at the time a cylinder is changed and a daily check list is ran on the system. The Conaway WWTP has been in opperation since Dec. 1987 with no accidents. Any accidental release would be coordinated with the Buchanan County Emergency services Haz-Mat team ran by the Grundy Fire Dept. Notification of these agencies would be made by the Plant superintendent or a representative of the plant. The plant has repair parts on hand and have trained people to repair any part of the system. Any thing that cannot be repaired is replaced with new equipment."
