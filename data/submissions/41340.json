Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Agriform's Woodland facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1,000 North East Street, Woodland, California, 95776 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia and ammonium polyphosphate. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by rail-car and stored in one 38,887-gallon rail-car and 18,000-gallon and one 22,400 gallon storage tank (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 373,500 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight)  is produced at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in one 416,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 3,120,000  pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 30% active ingredient by weight, is  936,000 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nIn compliance with the 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations to the Clean Air Act, the description covering the worst-case release scenario has been eliminated from the executive summary.\n\n4.

Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific planned changes to the aqua ammonia processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs.\n\n8. Notification Update\n\nThe RMP 2004 update requirements (40 CFR 68.190) require that an emergency contact e-mail address be listed for this facility.  The emergency contact e-mail address is:  David Ito at dito@TremontAg.com \n\nAs part of the new requirements, contractor/consultants contact information must be listed.
