      "SummaryText": "CHLORINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (RMP)\r\nCITY OF CHICAGO\r\nDEPARTMENT OF WATER\r\n\r\nSawyer Water Purification Plant (SWPP)\r\nJune 21, 2004\r\nRevised December 18, 2017\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe Sawyer Water Purification Plant (SWPP) treats water to potable drinking standards for the City of Chicago and many surrounding communities.  The plant uses chlorine to disinfect water from Lake Michigan and stores more than the threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs of chlorine onsite.  The disinfection process is the only process at SWPP subject to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations codified in 40CFR Part 68.  Chlorine is an easily liquefiable greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor.  It is listed by the USEPA as a regulated toxic substance for release prevention.  Chlorine is safe to use as a drinking water disinfectant under regular plant conditions when handled with appropriate care.\r\n\r\nSWPP Chlorine Process\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine is trucked to the plant site in 1-ton (2,000 lbs) pressurized containers by an outside vendor.  Liquefied chlorine in the containers is changed to gas-phase chlorine with evaporators.  Chlorine gas is mixed with water at multiple application points for disinfection as part of the water treatment process.\r\n\r\nSWPP Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nThe City of Chicago Department of Water Management (CDWM) in concert with SWPP management is committed to manage and operate the plant in accordance with relevant USEPA regulations and general good operating practices to ensure minimum risk of a chlorine release from the disinfection process.  The CDWM has voluntarily implemented a  Process Safety Management (PSM) program, similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM plan, for the SWPP chlorine process although it is not explicitly subject to this federal program.  In order to ensure periodic monitoring and continual evaluation of the RMP"

      "SummaryText": "/ PSM program elements being implemented at the plant, the CDWM has instituted an emergency response (ER) organizational structure within the Department and SWPP.   Along with their regular duties, members of this structure have additional RMP / PSM-related responsibilities for the long-term management of the RMP / PSM program.  Finally, three year audits to the PSM have been done since 1999 with most recent being completed 10/18/2017.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nAs required by USEPA regulations, the worst-case release scenario was assumed to be the complete loss of the contents of a 1-ton chlorine container during unloading operations.  In this facility, chlorine containers are unloaded and stored indoors.  For this analysis no passive mitigation measures were assumed.  The USEPA guidance for defining a worst-case release scenario for unmitigated release of gas is to estimate the release rate over a 10-minute period of the largest quantity resulting from a pipe or vessel failure.  Thus, the chlorine emission rate from the worst-case release scenario used was the loss of 2,000 lbs of chlorine averaged over a 10-minute period, i.e., 200 lbs/min.  USEPAAA\u00bfs public-domain RMP*Comp model was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l (or 3 ppm).  The toxic endpoint distance does go offsite.  It should be noted that the potential offsite impact due to a release is greatly minimized on account of the location of SWPP which is bounded by Lake Michigan on the north and east.  Since almost 50 percent of the area within the circle of influence, defined by the distance to the toxic endpoint as the radius, is over Lake Michigan, potential offsite impacts are greatly reduced. \r\n\r\nSWPP employees thoroughly inspect every chlorine container for potential leaks and overall structural integrity upon delivery and prior to process hookup.  Chlorine sensors and a system of emergency alarms at strategic locations around the chlorine process initiate the em"

This minimizes the chance that a container will fully discharge its contents in a release and minimizes the potential for an offsite impact.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe following three most likely alternative scenarios (ranked in order of probability of occurrence) were identified:\r\n      Case (1): Container valve failure;\r\n      Case (2): Shear of pigtail containing liquid chlorine; and\r\n      Case (3): Over-pressurization of rupture disk\r\n\r\nThe above alternative cases were modeled using USEPAAA\u00bfs public-domain RMP*Comp model to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l (or 3 ppm).  Effects of both passive mitigation (due to building enclosure) and active mitigation afforded by the SWPP scrubber system were included in the analysis.  The maximum toxic endpoint distance does go offsite, but only by a few hundred feet.  It should be noted that any potential offsite impact due to a release is greatly minimized by virtue of SWPPAA\u00bfs location, which is bounded by Lake Michigan on the north and east. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, SWPP employees thoroughly inspect every connection from the chlorine container to the liquid piping for potential leaks and overall structural integrity prior to hookup.  In addition, SWPP has regular operation and maintenance procedures for evaluating and replacing, if required, container valves and rupture disks.  Also, the plant has chlorine sensors and a system of emergency alarms at strategic locations around the chlorine process that initiate the emergency response procedures (i.e., release abatement and evacuation) that includes activation of the emergency caustic scrubber to neutralize potential chlorine releases.  This minimizes the chance for a discharge of quantities of chlorine which could result in an offsite impact.\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention Progra"

      "SummaryText": "m\r\n\r\nSWPP is a municipal organization  not subject to OSHA regulations. However, SWPP has implemented a safety management program for the chlorine process similar to an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program (codified in 29CFR Part 1910.119).  The scope of the PSM program encompasses various facets of release prevention; e.g., it engenders employee participation, increases employee awareness about the hazards of handling chlorine, establishes safe standard operating procedures and enhances access to process safety information.  The SWPP performs the regulatory required PSM audit and HAZOP process hazards analysis (PHA) on the chlorine system in order to review existing operating procedures, equipment maintenance schedules, operational safeguards and identify action items to render the process safer.  SWPP has a written PSM program along with an O&M (Operations and Maintenance) Manual with the help of outside consultants.  The written PSM program provides the procedural backbone for safe operability functions (i.e., continual review of safe operating procedures, review of mechanical integrity of equipment, improved maintenance schedules, increased training, better access to process safety information and hazard awareness for both employees and onsite contractors, and effective emergency response planning), and allows SWPP to maintain, review and evaluate the program on a periodic basis.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nSWPP has had no reportable chlorine releases in the past five years (10/18/2012 - 10/18/2017).\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nSince SWPP has adopted the safe management practices similar to the OSHA PSM program, the plant has updated existing procedures for Emergency Planning and Response to conform to applicable PSM regulations.
