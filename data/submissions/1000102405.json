The SFI plant uses anhydrous\nammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage as well as for cooling of manufacturing process lines. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk.\nManagement of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM)\nregulations, SFI has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees\nand the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility\ncompleted an initial process hazards analyses (PHAs) for ammonia using the industry standard\nWhat-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration.\nThe most recent PHA revalidations were completed in 2021 using the HAZOP methodology. The original and revalidation PHAs were completed using technical and operations staff from the Fairview Plant as well as experienced facilitators. \n\nThe PHAs reviewed operational, human factors, and facility siting issues relative to the design of the\nrefrigeration system, and recommendations were made, as appropriate, to address these concerns.\nSFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia\nand measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases\nof ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the\nammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and manageme"

This training includes topics such as classification\nsystems and hazard identification; ammonia spill control and containment; respiratory protection; air\nmonitoring instrumentation; proper personal protective equipment; medical monitoring; and proper\ntermination procedures for emergency response activities. The facility conducts annual\nHAZWOPER refresher training to keep employees current and comfortable with their responsibilities\nunder the plan using classroom discussion and response to mock emergency scenarios. \n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of\nthe accidental release of the largest vessel in the systems. Although such a release is highly\nunlikely, the regulation requires this review.\n\nSFI stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in storage as well as for\ncooling of manufacturing process lines. Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and\nflexibility, in addition to benefits to employee safety.
