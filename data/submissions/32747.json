This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The North Little Rock Waste Water Utility's Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0    Description of the North Little Rock Waste Water Utility's Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of North Little Rock, Arkansas.  The facility is part of the North Little Rock Waste Water Utility wastewater collection and treatment system which services an area with a population of over 60,000 people and has a design wastewater flow of 12 million gallons per day.  The Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for the disinfection of the wastewater prior to releasing to the receiving stream.\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires the Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the chlorine stored and used in the chlorination process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the "

The following details the prevention program elements at the Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered processes.\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant has performed a Hazard Review of the chlorination process; an additional Hazard Review is scheduled to ensure the critical elements for safely storing and handling chlorine are in place in the process. The Hazard Review has benn recently updated.\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant has experienced employees operating the chlorination process at the facility.  These operators have been certified as being knowledgeable in the procedures required to safely operate the chlorination process.  Written operating procedures are being prepared which will be used to:\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n\n\n4.4    Training\n\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A formal training program is being developed to ensure a record of all training is maintained and refresher training is provided"

A formal Preventive Maintenance program is being developed which includes:\n\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n3. an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n\n4.6    Compliance Audits\n\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner. The most recent Compliance Audit was conducted in June of 2002.\n\n4.7    Incident Investigations\n\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant will investigate all incidents that could reasonably result in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant is developing an incident investigation program which encourages employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team will be assembled, and the investigation will be initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate process enhancements implemented.\n\n4.8    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\n\nIndustry standards are followed at The Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.  The vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders.
