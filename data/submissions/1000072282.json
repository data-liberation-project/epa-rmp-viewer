Three new industrial facilities (Legacy, G.A. West, and Superior Carrier) have been constructed near the Hatters Pond Gas Plant. These facilities are in the impact area of the worst-case and alternative flammable release scenarios considered in this RMP. The management of change (MOC) number for this update is HEC2018-07-06_5981_Hatters Pond RMP Update for Public Receptors. \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nHatters Pond Gas Plant (Hatters Pond) is operated by HILCORP is located in Creola, Alabama just south of Radcliff Road.  The primary products produced at the facility are condensate, propane, butane, and residue gas.  This facility is required to implement a Risk Management Program due to the type and quantities of chemicals that are located onsite.\n\n\n\nHatters Pond Gas Plant's environmental, safety, and health policies emphasize the importance of safeguarding employees, contractors, the environment and the community from potential exposures to chemical materials, by-products and end products, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment, in which its activities are carried out. Hatters Pond has implemented programs to ensure compliance with regulations and continued improvement of environmental, health and safety performance over the years. One part of these programs is a risk management plan that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Rule 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nThe RMP regulated chemicals onsite are iso-butane, butane, ethane, methane, iso-pentane, pentane, and propane. There are no toxic chemicals that exceed RMP thresholds. The facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, as well as Program 3 of EPA's RMP Rule. \n\n\n\nHatters Pond has a long-sta"

One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Hatters Pond utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  Hatters Pond's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained emergency response teams will make necessary efforts to contain, mitigate, monitor, and/or stop the release. In addition to handling the release, the facility has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.   \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions. While the probability of this scenario is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case flammable release distance to endpoint was determined with the use of the RMP*Comp. The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure depends on the heat of combustion and storage quantity. A vapor cloud explosion of a flammable mixture of condensate from one of the two condensate storage tanks results in the largest distance to the endpoint (1.1 miles), and, is thus, the worst-case release scenario.  A release of flammable mixture from the condensate tank in the product storage area would endanger a population of approximately 119 individuals.\n\n\n\nFacilities must also prepare an alternative scenario that could have an off-site impact, based on facility operations. The alternative scenario may take into account emergency response control measures and actual storage and weat"

The alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case scenario. \n\n\n\nIn order to estimate the release rates for the alternative release scenarios, Hatters Pond chose to use Chapter 9:  Estimation of Release Rates for Alternative Scenarios for Flammable Substances located within the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis issued by EPA.  This method uses several parameters to calculate the release rate of a flammable substance.  It was determined that this method would provide a more accurate release rate for the alternative case scenario analysis. Other alternative releases considered did not impact different public or environmental receptors, therefore, only one alternative release scenario was chosen. \n\n\n\nFor propane, a hypothetical release scenario was identified for a rupture near a valve which would lead to a 4\" flow area.  It was estimated the release would continue over a 60-minute period. The scenario resulted in an estimated distance to endpoint of 0.3 mile and would impact an estimated population of six.  \n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe processes at the facility have hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The facility has existing safety features in place applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  These features include but are not limited to: (1) hydrocarbon/hydrogen sulfide detectors with audible and visual alarms, (2) process relief valves that discharge into the plant flare system, (3) automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process, (4) plant and compressor station emergency shutdowns, (5) fire and smoke detection system with audible and visual alarms, (6) curbing and/or diking to contain liquid releases, (7) redundant equipment and instrumentation such as un"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility personnel who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nHatters Pond promotes employee participation.  Operators, maintenance technicians, and engineers, as well as supervisors and managers participate fully in Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Studies, procedure development, trainings, and incident investigations. A broad range of facility personnel participate in a wide range of safety related activities.  Every employee has access to documentation and files related to the PSM and RMP programs, and every employee is responsible for complying with all aspects of these programs.  \n\n\n\nHot Work & Work Permits\n\n\n\nThe facility's hot work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition. The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained onsite. The facility implements other work permits as necessary to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance"

Some contractors work on or near process equipment; therefore, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. The contractor safety program places stringent qualification requirements on contracting firms before entering the facility to perform work. Contractors provide training documentation of their employees that meet or exceed the requirement of the job scope. Contractors are provided with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, (3) safe work practices, and (4) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. \n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the facility to (1) inform contract employers of potential hazards related to the work, (2) explain HILCORP's emergency action plan, and (3) control contract employees' entrance and exit to and from the facility.\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of HILCORP to (1) evaluate contract employer's safety performance and programs, and (2) periodically evaluate contractor's safety performance and maintain an injury and illness log of the contractor's work at the facility.   \n\n\n\nIt is the contractor's employer's responsibility to ensure that the employee is (1) trained in safe work practices of his/her job, (2) informed on potential hazards of the job or process, (3) aware that he/she must inform a plant representative of potential hazards in the contractor's work.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nHatters Pond maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program, to protect the safety of "

The plan includes procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance would accidentally be released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  Facility responders are trained and qualified on the proper response techniques for the chemicals associated with the facility and are equipped with the necessary equipment to perform critical response procedures.\n\n\n\nAs part of the ongoing training program for responders, routine drills are conducted onsite. At Hatters Pond, emergency planning and response includes: (1) procedures for handling small releases, (2) staging areas at the plant, (3) emergency equipment available at the plant, (4) emergency medical transportation, (5) a Spill Control and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC), and (6) a Contingency Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is equipped with a facility-wide alarm system. The activated alarm system notifies personnel to proceed to the muster stations until they are given additional instructions or an \"all clear\" notice is given. Current emergency phone numbers are maintained in the control room of the facility and in the Facility Response Plan, which is immediately available in several critical areas of the plant so that timely notifications"

The facility produces condensate, propane, butane and residue gas. There are currently no chemicals or components at the facility that carry the Trade Secret label.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR HISTORY\n\n\n\nHatters Pond is committed to minimizing potential risks to the public, employees and environment. A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Within the past five years, there have been no releases of a regulated substance from a regulated process that have occurred and have resulted in injuries. If any incidents were to occur, the facility would investigate to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  After any incident, changes would be introduced as necessary to decrease the probability of the incident reoccurring. If another incident would occur, as per the procedure, a thorough investigation would be initiated to determine the causes of the incident. In addition, the incidents would be reported to the appropriate agencies. \n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nHatters Pond believes that continuous improvement is the key to success in the future. This is especially true in the safety, health, and environmental areas. The facility constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews and the incident investigation program.  \n\n\n\nManagement continuously looks for opportunities to improve our abilities in protecting our people and our community. Hatters Pond management actively solicits and implements safety and process improvement suggestions through our safety committee and our employee participation program to solve problems and implement solutions.\n\n"
