This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility, located near Wasmutter, Wyoming, operates a condensate stabilization process to produce petroleum products, including natural gas, natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate from the unstabilized condensate liquid inlet stream.   The mixed NGL stream is recovered from the overhead of the condensate stabilization process.  The only regulated flammable at the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility is the mixed NGL product produced from the condensate stabilization process.  This mixed NGL product contains regulated flammables from methane through pentane and these compounds are present as components of the mixed stream.  There are no regulated toxic compounds at the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility and hydrogen sulfide is not present in the facility in any concentrations or volumes subject to regulation or of concern.  Due to being a field production facility upstream of a ?gas plant? as defined in the regulations, the other hydrocarbon streams at the facility are not subject to the RMP rule.  However, the scenario of a catastrophic failure of the NGL storage bullet represents the greatest off-site impact distance potential from any portion of this facility. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facilit"

      "SummaryText": "y.  The process at the facility  is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation, but is exempt from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard as it is only staffed part time.  The facility has chosen, in-house, to apply a few of the OSHA PSM concepts and techniques to the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program, where such limited application provides a benefit.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a team to evaluate process hazards.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  \n \nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Reviews\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nWhile not an OSHA PSM facility, the Wamsuter Stabilization Facility makes use of some of the PSM techniques in its safety management program.  The Wamsutter Stabilization Facility uses hazard and operability analysis techniques to perform evaluations.  This type of analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe process hazard review team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to process hazard review findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the process hazard reve"

All approved mitigation options in response to process hazard review team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of any new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit accedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement t"

New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through supervisor reveiw, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators skills on the operating procedures are periodically evaluated to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A safety review involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Wamsutter Stabilization Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during process hazard reviews and process hazard review revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted whenever informal review indicate the need for a formal compliance audit.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.

The following is a description of existing safely features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered processes at the Wamsutter Stabilization Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n?    Hydrorcarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n?    Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n?    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\n\n?    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n?    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\n?    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n?    Trained emergency response personnel.\n\n?    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility has had no accidents within the past 5 years.    \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Wamsutter Stabilization Facility maintains its own written emergency response program"
