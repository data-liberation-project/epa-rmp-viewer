These materials include  Risk Management Program (RMP) guidance to help our facility prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.  \n\nThis Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that, when integrated, minimize public risk of hazardous chemical release exposure.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with the specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements. \n\nOverall responsibility for all facility activities including Risk Management activities, lie with the Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager has delegated the following responsibilities:\n\n1.  RMP hazard assessment and document control to the Manager of Engineering\n\n2.  Development and maintenance of the RMP Emergency Response Program to the Safety Specialist\n\nMore specific responsibilities are delegated to other staff positions as detailed in the Plant Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSepton is committed to conduct its operations in a safe, responsible manner and reducing risks to health and the environment.  Compliance with all applicable legal requirements is mandatory and considered essential to upholding the company's commitment.  Septon's Environmental, Health and Safety programs include policies, procedures, standards and guidance materials designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nSepton, located in Pasadena, Texas, manufactures styrene thermoplastic elastomers in a batch polymerization process.  The product is used in the production of consumer goods such as pen grips, tool grips, automotive parts and plastic modification.\n\nTwo RMP regulated substances are present"

      "SummaryText": " on site at the Septon facility.  The substances are 1,3 butadiene and isoprene, both are classified as flammable materials in the RMP rule.  The chemicals are raw materials for manufacturing of thermoplastic elastomers.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nIn general, Septon has implemented numerous steps to minimize the potential release of any chemical on site.  All storage tanks are located within dike areas; truck unloading facilities are equipped with low pressure alarms, automated shut-off valves, sprinkler systems and are located within dike areas.  Butadiene storage is equipped with a water deluge system.  Isoprene storage is equipped with a foam injection system.  All of the process areas at the facility subject to the EPA Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  Process containing 1, 3 butadiene and/or isoprene that are subject to the EPA RMP rule have been incorporated into the OSHA PSM Program.  Thus a program is in place that is in compliance with both the OSHA and RMP regulations.  Specific elements of the program include the following:\n\n*Employee participation in process safety management and accident prevention\n\n*Process Safety Information\n\n*Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n*Documented Operating Procedures\n\n*Training Programs for all employees\n\n*Contractor Requirements and Training\n\n*Pre-startup Reviews\n\n*Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n*Quality Assurance Program\n\n*Management of Change Process\n\n*Incident Investigation\n\n*Compliance Audits\n\n*Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\nPrevention steps for the Worst Case Scenario consist of preventive tank maintenance, inspection and safe work practices.  The 1, 3 butadiene tank is located in a secure dike area.  There are no flammable substances stored within the dike area.  In the unlikely event of a tank rupture, the dike surrounding the tank will minimize the spread of the 1, 3 butadiene and significantly reduce the impact of the spill.\n\n\n\nPrevention "

      "SummaryText": "steps for the Alternate Case Scenario consist of remote control shutoff valves located at each end of the truck.  Additionally, the offloading line can be shutdown downstream of the unloading site.  Operators are trained according to a documented procedure for the unloading of butadiene.   Personal protective equipment is located at the unloading area to assure a quick response to any potential spill.  Gas detectors are located in the area along with a deluge system to help prevent chance of fire.\n\n\n\nFive Year History\n\n\n\nNo incidents meeting the criteria for the five-year history have occurred at the Kuraray Septon facility during the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nKuraray America maintains its own emergency response teams for fire fighting and hazmat response.  Additionally Kuraray Septon is a member of CIMA and may call upon the resources of CIMA if needed.    \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nChemical safety is a part of the working culture at the Septon facility.  Reducing employees' and the general public's risk to chemical exposure is an ongoing effort.  Septon resolves all findings from Process Hazard Analyses, internal and external audits some of which result in process modifications.    \n\n"
