This facility has implemented an electronic preventative maintenance system that uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible individuals. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours a day - 5 days a week and then on-call 2 days per week. There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Abbotsford Fire Department and the LEPC, in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substances\r\nAt this location Abbyland Foods, Inc. manufactures food products (primarily sausage).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311612. \r\n\r\nAbbyland Foods, Inc. has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68  at the Abbotsford, Wisconsin facility - Anhydrous Ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia). The storage and process areas on the facility are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the product fresh and wholesome. Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 lbs. The quantity of ammonia on site is approximately 63,770 lbs. \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE standard 34-1989. Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities. Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature. It is not poisonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue. Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and at high concent"

The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of the respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia. \r\n\r\n3.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps. \r\n\r\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system. Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program. EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, it is in compliance with RMP Program 3. Thus, Abbyland Foods, Inc. ammonia PSM program has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \r\n\r\nThere are several key aspects of the prevention program: \r\n1.\tUtility personnel (Refrigeration Operators) are present on-site and assigned to the ammonia system 24 hours a day - 5 days a week on call on weekends. \r\n2.\tThere is Plant wide ammonia detection which notifies the Utility Personnel on-site and an auto-dialer system to notify Utility Personnel that are off-site. \r\n3.\tMost of the ammonia piping system is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of an ammonia release. \r\n4.\tThe facility conducts annual awareness training for employees and contractors. The facility has a training program for the refrigeration operators which includes operating procedures. The facility conducts approximately 6-7 emergency response drills per year for th on-site response team. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIncident Investigations and Nuisance Odors\r\n  The facility has an extensive Incident Investigation policy as part of its OSHA PSM program. The program includes investigations of \"near misses\" and a complete Incident Investigation form. It also includes a form for \"nuisance odor\" investigations, minor odors reported that are investigated and tracked. \r\n\r\n5.0 Emergency Respon"
