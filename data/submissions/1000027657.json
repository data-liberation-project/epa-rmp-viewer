Natural gas is received via pipeline and processed using refrigeration and cryogenic processes.  NGL, which is a complex mix of hydrocarbons, or propane are removed from the natural gas, which is returned directly back into the natural gas pipeline.  The NGL is then shipped via pipeline to another EnLink facility for further processing. This Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Deadwood Cyro Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Deadwood Cyro Plant is subject to Prevention Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nThe Deadwood Cyro Plant employs seven (7) full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P.

The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.    \n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Deadwood Cyro Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL processing operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the NGL processing operations, and reducing subseq"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. NGL or propane are removed from the natural gas, which is returned directly back into the natural gas pipeline.  The NGL is then shipped via pipeline to another EnLink facility for further processing.  The total Facility inventory of NGL is 52,859 gallons (207,327 pounds), and the largest NGL storage tank is 36,194 gallons (141,965 pounds).  The total Facility inventory of propane is 4,076 gallons (16,768 pounds), and the largest propane storage tank is 1,503 gallons (6,184 pounds).\n\n\n\nThe substances stored at the Deadwood Cyro Plant were also evaluated for toxic characteristics; it was determined that there are no toxic substances handled at the Facility in quantities that exceed RMP threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Deadwood Cyro Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the Prevention Program required under OSHA's PSM. The Deadwood Cyro Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation, \n\n?    Pr"

The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \n\n\n\n?    Public and emergency response agency notification procedures; \n\n?    Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \n\n?    Emergency response measures; \n\n?    Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \n\n?    Employee training; and \n\n?    Program review procedures. \n\n\n\nThe Deadwood Cyro Plant maintains written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response with the Glasscock County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Glasscock County Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff's Office will coordinate with the Glasscock County/Garden City Volunteer Fire Department or Glass County LEPC as needed in the event of NGL or propane release.  For these reasons, the Deadwood Cyro Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is "
