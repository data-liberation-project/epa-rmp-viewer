The same property that makes this chemical valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary exposure, to reduce the threat to our own health and that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner of which the chemicals are handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and regulated substance handled\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this facility is to provide treatment of water for Hardin County Water District No. 2.  The regulated substance stored on site is chlorine. Chlorine is used in the treatment process to produce water that meets Federal and State standards.  The maximum inventory of chlorine is 4,000 pounds.  Chemical venders supply the chlorine to the facility by truck in one (1) ton cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternate scenarios, include measures to limit the distances for our chlorine scenario.\r\n\r\n3. Worst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nFailure for one (1) ton chlorine cylinder would release 2,000 pounds of chemical.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as gas, which is heavier than air.  The distance to endpoint point of 0.0087 mg/L was determined by EPA's RMP*CompVer 1.07 to be 2.2 miles.  Public receptors within the distance are schools, hospitals, recreational areas, detention centers, industry and community stores.  The estimated population within 2.2 radius using landview 6 information is 11,281.\r\n\r\n4.  Alternate release scenario\r\n\r\nA bad connection on one (1) ton cylinder of chlorine results in the release of gas through an opening equal to 3/8\" line.  This release occurs indoors and is red"

Thirty (30) minutes pass before the halogen system kill switch is activated.  Three hundred pounds of chlorine is released.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l was determined by the EPA's RMP*CompVer 1.07 to be 0.1 Miles.  The estimated residential population with the 0.1 mile radius is 0.\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed a program that meet the requirement of the EPA's Risk Management and OSHA Process Safety Management Programs.\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThis facility has not experienced any chemical release of chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nSince facility personnel will only respond to incidential releases, we are required to develop an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety rather than a full emergency response plan.  The Elizabethtown Fire Department will respond to and mitigate any threat by an accidential release of chlorine from our facility.  The facility is included in the Hardin County Emergency Planning Committee Response Plan."
