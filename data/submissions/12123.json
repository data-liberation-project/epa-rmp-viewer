This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Florida River Compression Facility, located near Bayfield, Colorado, operates a variety of processes to remove CO2 from the inlet gas and compress the natural gas for sales.  No separation or recovery of NGLs or condensate occurs at the Florida facility.   In addition, the plant operates an ammonia based refrigeration process for cooling of the compressor oils.  The Florida River Compression Facility has no regulated flammables due to being upstream from a gas processing plant and the exemption for naturally occurring hydrocarbons in this type of a facility.  The only regulated toxic at the facility is anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant in the compressor oil cooling system.  Hydrogen sulfide is not present in the facility in any concentrations or volumes subject to regulation or of concern.\n\nAll of the covered processes in the facility are designated as \"Program 3\" under this Risk Management Plan and handled accordingly.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nToxic Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of toxic substances is a catastrophic failure of the largest vessel (ammonia receiver) in the ammonia based refrigeration system. This scenario assumes the release of the entire vessel contents (5,805 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia during a 10 minute period.  Although we have numerous "

The dispersion of the released ammonia was modeled using HEGADAST 3+ incorporating the conservative assumptions of a liquid release which flashes to an aerosol vapor cloud and stable/low speed wind conditions (worst case meteorological conditions; F stability and 1.5 meters/sec wind speed).  The maximum distance to the regulatory toxic endpoints of 200 ppm and 1000 ppm was predicted by the modeling to be 0.6 miles and 0.2 miles respectively. \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for anhydrous ammonia was chosen as the complete severing of a 2\" process pipe connected to the liquid phase of the same ammonia receiver vessel.  Again, the entire vessel contents of 5,805 pounds was  released through the broken pipe but over the time period necessary to empty the vessel through a 2\" orifice (~10 minutes).  Alternate case, typical calm daytime meteorological conditions (D stability and 3 m/s wind speed) were used in the modeling.   No mitigation or control measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoints of 200 ppm and 1000 ppm for the typical calm daytime meteorological conditions was 0.2 miles and 0.1 miles respectively. \n\nFlammable Release Scenarios\n\nThere are no processes containing flammables at the Florida River Compression Facility covered under the RMP rule and flammable release scenarios were not evaluated. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPAs) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHAs) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary add"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Florida River Compression Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on an ongoing basis. The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Florida River Compression Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe Florida River Compression Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local a"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Florida River Compression Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, the Florida River Compression Facility maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Florida River Compression Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.
