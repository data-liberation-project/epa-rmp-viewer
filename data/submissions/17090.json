      "SummaryText": "Description of water system for Helena, Montana\n\nThe City of Helena's Water Division (HWD) goal is to ensure customer satisfaction by\nconsistently delivering high quality water today and in the future.\n\nThe HWD serves more than 25 thousand customers with 9364 service taps including 155 fire\nlines with an average of 5.2 million gallons of water per day on an annual basis. The total annual\ngallonage from all sources for 1997 is 1.777 BG* with a peak day of 10.4 MG*. To supply this\namount of water, we operate two surface water treatment plants--the Missouri River Water\nTreatment Plant (MRTP) located at 2560 Canyon Ferry Road, and the Tenmile Water Treatment\nPlant west of Helena at 1115 Rimini Road. The Tenmile Water Plant is in operation year round\nwhile the MRTP is used only during the summer months for peak demands.  Additional water is\nobtained from the Hale system which consists of the Oro Fino and Eureka infiltration galleries.\nThe department's two treatment plants are maintained, evaluated and upgraded to stay abreast of\nadvancements in technology, health science and governmental regulations.\n\nThe Helena water distribution system consists of five finished water storage reservoirs (Malben,\nWinne, Hale and Upper Hale, Woolston) and pumping stations (Forest Estates, Hale, Eureka,\nDahlhausen, Reeders Village) linked together with 185 miles of water transmission and\ndistribution pipelines. The Chessman (530 MG) and Scott (195 MG) reservoirs in the Tenmile\nwatershed also provide additional water for the Tenmile Water Plant during low flows. These\nreservoirs are filled with spring run off water.  \n\nCarollo Engineers of Boise, Idaho completed a Water Master Plan Update for the City of Helena\nin April 1997. The Public Works Department has copies of the Water Master Plan if customers\nwould like to review it. Phase one of this update determined that the existing Missouri River\nTreatment Plant should be rehabilitated or replaced due to age of equipment, public health risks,"

The least\ncostly scenario was to replace the capacity of the existing plant with high quality groundwater\nsupplies if available. Test drilling of these wells has started in 1998, and the outlook is not good\nand recycling on surface water treatment plant is likely scenario.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nTo prevent chlorine release it is standard operating procedure to have two operators work on tank\nchanges or to work on the Chlorine Pressure Reducing Valves (CPRV's). An emergency repair\nkit is stored close to the cylinders. Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in an\nadjacent room. They are wall mounted with quick release brackets. An oxygen cylinder is also\nstored by the SCBA's. Regular maintenance is performed on all chlorination equipment and\nsafety equipment. Work orders are generated for chlorination equipment and all safety\nequipment, i.e. SCBA's. All work orders are tracked by computer.\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis is a local government owned and operated facility for the production of potable water for the\nCity of Helena. The only reportable regulated substance for the RMP plan is chlorine. Two to\neight tons of chlorine are stored at this facility in 150# and ton cylinders. No more than two ton\ncylinders are on line at a time. One cylinder is in actual use and the other is in standby. The\nonline tanks are on tank mounted isolated regulators called Chlorine Pressure Reducing Valves\n(CPRV's) that reduce the chlorine pressure to a vacuum state. Chlorine feed equipment supplies\na vacuum to the tanks allowing the release of chlorine to the feeders. All feed lines supply\nchlorine below atmospheric pressure. Should a leak develop the feeders would be unable to\nsupply enough vacuum to continue the release of chlorine and the feed would stop at the CPRV\nattached to each tank. No flammable substances or other restricted items are stored in the\nc"

If the alarm conditions exists after an hour it\nagain starts calling operators out. All alarms and autodialers are on batteries, uniterruptable\npower supplies, and back up electrical generator.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the total loss of one ton of chlorine through catastrophic valve\nor tank failure. Response time could be so limited (less than 15 minutes) that under the right\nconditions total loss of one ton of chlorine is possible. \n\nAlternate Scenario\n\nValve failure or leak while tank is being worked on. Disregarding minor releases the less worst\ncase scenario would be CPRV failure, CPRV to tank connection, or tank valve leak. Operators\nwould close the tank valve either shutting chlorine off or reducing the flow to a manageable level\nfor repairs.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention.\n\nOperators are trained in the proper way to change CPRV's and tanks. Regular maintenance is\nkept on the CPRV's, lines, and feeders. Cylinders with exceptionally difficult or tight valves are\nrejected and returned. Self contained breathing apparatus and tanks are kept in a separate\nadjacent room along with emergency oxygen. Operators are trained in proper leak detection and\ncorrection. Two operators are required for tank changes or repairs. A third operator is notified of\nany leaks and told to notify emergency responders if communication is lost for more than 20\nminutes .\n\nFive Year Accident History.\n\nNo accidents or chlorine releases in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAs per written emergency manual.
