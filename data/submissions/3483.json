      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe City of Salina owns and operates the municipal water treatment plant, located at 401 South Fifth Street, Salina, Kansas.  This plant uses chlorine for disinfection.  Chlorine is a hazardous substance that, if released, poses a significant threat to the health of plant personnel and Salina citizens. \n\nThe Salina Utilities Department developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for control of catastrophic releases of hazardous substances, such as chlorine, from the water treatment plant.  Development, implementation, registration, and submittal of the RMP, fulfills requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan regulations (Federal Register (FR) 61 [120], p. 31668).  This program continues EPA's commitment to the protection of the public and environment.  The intent of the regulation is to lessen the number and severity of chemical accidents.  \n\nThe water treatment plant has the capacity to store 36,000 pounds of chlorine.  Since this quantity exceeds the EPA's RMP regulation thresholds, chlorine must be addressed in the RMP.  The water treatment plant does not contain any other toxics or flammables above threshold quantities that are regulated by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe City of Salina, Kansas (Salina) Water Treatment Plant (WTP) prevents accidental releases of chlorine by training and adhering to codes and good engineering practices.  In the WTP's prevention program, safety information, hazard reviews, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations are continuously updated.  Every employee of the Salina WTP remains aware of the potential for chlorine releases and disturbance of the systems.  \n\nIn an emergency, the WTP's first consideration is the safety of personnel and the community.  The second consideration is the protection of property, equipment, and the facility.  The Salin"

As a very conservative estimate, the scenario does not consider the scrubber, resulting in an endpoint off-site (regulations state an off-site endpoint).  The distance to end point in an urban setting is 0.48 miles.  Barring an unforseen problem,  the scrubber will mitigate the release and prevent the chlorine from leaving the building.  The scrubber would remove the chlorine, using its once through three stage absorption system.  In this case, the endpoint is not offsite, and the distance to end point is 0 miles.\n\nThe estimated affected population within the 0.48-mile radius is 3,200. The alternative release scenario area of concern includes residential populations, institutions including schools and hospitals, parks and recreational areas, and major commercial and office buildings.  No national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; or federal wilderness areas are within this area.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nSalina prepared an accidental release prevention program.

In addition to operating procedure changes, the PHA team recommended that a portion of Fourth Street should be closed to the public, restricting access to chemical delivery, plant maintenance, and trains. \n\n\t \tThe Salina WTP has adopted written standard operating procedures (SOPs) that provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  The procedures address initial startup, normal operations, normal and emergency shutdown, inspections, temporary operation, restartup, and consequences of deviation. \n\n\t \tThe Salina WTP implemented a Risk Management and Chlorine Safety Training Program with guidelines for conducting regular, structured plant training for personnel, including operators and maintenance mechanics.  Records of the training program, including content of the course, course manual, examination, and record of attendance are maintained.   \n\n\t \tThe management of change program is intended to avoid making any change in the chlorine process, equipment, technology, or procedures that would increase the potential for a hazardous release.

The WTP relies on the Police Department, Fire Department, and the Saline County Emergency Management to assist in responding to emergency situations.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nAn offsite consequence analysis evaluates a worst-case and alternative release scenario to determine distances from the WTP at which chlorine would affect population and environment receptors should a release occur.  A worst-case release scenario involves a total release of the largest vessel containing chlorine, and this case represents the worst possible scenario regardless of the low probability of such an event.  The alternative case represents a more probable  scenario, and this scenario is more suitable in emergency planning.  The Salina WTP implements safe working practices to prevent chlorine releases.   \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nSince the Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants (guidance) published by the American Water Works Association Research Foundation (AWWARF) specifically focuses on water treatment plants, this guidance was used to determine distances to endpoints for chlorine.  The guidance's Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model, developed by the National Safety Council (NSC) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was selected to predict movement of chemicals in the atmosphere.  ALOHA is an appropriate choice for modeling requirements because it is well documented, publicly available, and recognized by the water treatment industry as an applicable modeling tool.  The scenario description for the storage vessels is a catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact, or construction defects.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the release of the largest amount from a single vessel for a gas stored as a liquid under pressure (chlorine), released in a ten-minute time period.

The ALOHA model used a release at ground level (0 feet) and urban topography surface roughness.  To account for gas density in the dispersion analysis, chlorine was considered a dense gas.  The temperature of the released liquid was taken as the highest daily maximum temperature of the previous three years, 105.80F.  The highest temperature is used to simulate the worst-case environmental conditions.\n\nA catastrophic scenario of a one-ton chlorine container is a 2,000-pound release at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.  Including the temperature correction, the distance to the endpoint was 2.6 miles for a one-ton container. \n\nThe estimated affected population within the 2.6-mile radius is 36,000.  The worst-case release scenario area of concern includes residential populations, institutions, including schools and hospitals, parks and recreational areas, and major commercial, office, and industrial buildings.  No national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; or federal wilderness areas are within this area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nSince alternative release scenarios are more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios, these scenarios are more suitable in emergency planning.  In selecting an alternative release scenario, the five-year accident history and hazard review were considered.  The alternative release scenario assumed the standard modeling parameters: a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, Stability Class D, relative humidity of 50%, and a temperature of 770F.  \n\nBased on a one-ton chlorine container feeding chlorine as a gas, the alternative scenario involved a tubing failure, a bad connection, or a valve failure resulting in the gas release through the 5/16-inch-diameter valve body opening.
