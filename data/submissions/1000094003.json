      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis EPA RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r), and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68. The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are not applicable to the processes operated at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena Agri-Enterprises, LLC (Helena) is submitting the EPA RMP as an initial submission.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  One chemical (i.e. aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration) is stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Covered Process 1: Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling\n\n?    Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending\n\n\n\nNote:  A single 30,000-gallon AST (i.e. 44,752 lbs) is used for the storage of aqua ammonia. This is the maximum amount of aqua ammonia stored at this Facility.  However, a total of 89,504 lbs is reported in this RMP filing as the single AST is counted two times to address the two covered processes as the processes are physically connected by process piping. \n\n  \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes.  A single worst case release scenario representing both covered processes was prepared because both processes are physically connected by process piping.  The worst case release scenario assumes that the largest single vessel (i.e. a 30,000-gallon aqua ammonia AST) fails and instantaneously releases all content into the secondary containment that has a total "

      "SummaryText": "containment capacity of 57,464 gallons after considering displacement.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario for Covered Process 1 and 2 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to the rupture of a transfer hose during a transfer operation.  Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Operations Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the RMP program includes: Management System, Off-site Consequence Analysis, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility. The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years.  \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Facility.\n\n"
