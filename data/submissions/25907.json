      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: The accidental release prevention release policy employed by EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are typically followed.  The emergency response policy of EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  The goal of the spill policy of EnCana Gathering Services (USA) Inc. is to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The primary activity at West Rifle Compressor Station is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is NGL, which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include methane, ethane, butane, propane, pentane, iso-pentane, and iso-butane.  These regulated chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility is 29,998 gallons, which contains approximately 178,000 lbs. of regulated flammable chemicals.  Additionally, the Facility has three 300-barrel above ground storage tanks that store natural gas condensate.

      "SummaryText": "d Assessment Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency was applied for the worst case release scenario (WCRS). The worst-case scenario was assumed to be the release of the total quantity of the 29,998-gallon NGL storage tank forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which detonates.    For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for vapor cloud explosions.  Using the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure and the data contained in the RMP*COMPTM program, the WCRS distance was calculated at 0.45 miles from the Facility.  Based on a visual survey of the adjacent properties within a 0.45-mile radius of the facility, the population within the WCRS area is estimated to be ten (10).  Six industrial facilities are the nearby public receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.45 miles of the Facility.  Environmental receptors, as defined by 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.45 miles of the Facility, were not observed based on review of United States Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic maps.  Figure 2 shows the Facility relative to the WCRS maximum distance area depicted by a circle with a radius of 0.45 miles centered on the Facility.  Alternative Case Release Scenario:  The EPA document Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis was used to determine the consequences of an Alternative Case Release Scenario (ACRS) for the Facility.  Two separate situations of vapor cloud explosions were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure: a process piping release caused by the failure of an inlet piping valve on the NGL storage tank; and a process piping release caused by the failure of a truck loading hose connected to the NGL storage system.  The greatest distance to the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure was determined to"
