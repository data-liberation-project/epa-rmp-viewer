This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area.  Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere.  Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance.  Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment.  Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\nPlant leaders serve as coaches, encouragers, and examples.  Yet, in light of our culture, every person is considered a Safety Leader at home and work.  Constant discussion, planning, and training on safety issues will serve to maintain safety awareness and to insure that a high priority is always placed on safety.  No job is ever so urgent that safety is jeopardized.  Procedures are followed and time is taken to plan the best course of action with the least potential for mishap.  As situations and work requirements change, individual safety awareness must grow to accommodate and address these changes.\n\nLikewise, environmental performance will not be compromised to other priorities.  Our people will be leaders in ?doing the right thing.?  Team planning, awareness, knowledge, and sharing will be our primary tools for responsible process operations and accurate reporting.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be so comfortable with our records and procedures that we become passive.  Our goal and attitude will be sustained improvement in keeping safety and environment as priorities.  Our people are very capable of working safely, alert to preventing unsafe or environmentally risky situations, and intend to get better as time"

      "SummaryText": " goes by. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: The facility is located within an industrial site, with paved shipping and receiving areas.  The major structures and their designated functions are: Warehouse w/ docks; Receiving Area w/ docks; Machinery Spaces; Production Areas; and a Cooler.  The facility produces specialty food products for its distributors. The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance: and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers,and heat exchangers. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance.  The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\n  OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program. \n  Ammonia detection and alarm system in the machinery room.\n  Eyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\n  Personal protective equipment, including emergency respirators.\n  Emergency leak repair kits.\n  Emergency communication systems.\n  Training Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\n  Plant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\n  Plant Safety Award System.\n  Monthly Safety Meetings"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There was a release of ammonia through a safety relief valve on May 14, 2003. The safety relief valve opened as designed due to a process upset. It failed to properly re-seat, and released approximately 600 pound of ammonia to atmosphere in an approximate 45 minute period. The City of Dixon, Illinois Fire Department responded, and, as a precaution, evacuated the plant and some residents located downwind of the release. The process has been modified to prevent future releases, and the safety relief valve that did not properly re-seat has been replaced. No release have occurred since. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The facility's \"Emergency Action Plan\" has been developed in accordance with OSHA 1910.38. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies.  The plan includes \"Emergency Response to Anhydrous Ammonia,\" specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: The facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
