The facility is operated and maintained in accordance with OSHA 1910.119, PSM requirements.  A written emergency plan is in place which includes coordination and response by the Fremont County Emergency Management, if required.\n\nThe Lost Cabin Gas Plant removes carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur compounds, and water from natural gas in order to meet pipeline specifications for product sales.  The raw gas is cooled and contacted with a solvent (SELEXOL) to remove contaminates in each of three gas processing trains.  One of these gas processing trains contains H2S above the RMP threshold quantities and is considered a Program 3 process.  A propane refrigeration system is utilized in each train to cool the solvent to improve its performance.  Each of the three propane refrigeration systems is equipped with compressors, piping valves and a receiver tank that contains approximately 50,000 pounds of propane stored as a liquid under pressure.  Each of these propane systems is considered a Program 1 RMP process.\n\nTrain 3, the Program 3 process, is a gas processing facility with many vessels interconnecting by pipe.  There are several active mitigation devices in place to minimize a potential release of H2S.  The worst case release for Train 3 would discharge approximately 22,000 pounds of H2S.  According to the RMP Comp software, the distance to the endpoint from Train 3 for toxic conditions is 8.7 miles.  There are two small towns (Lysite and Lost Cabin, Wyoming) that are within the radius of exposure.  The combined population of these towns is approximately 90.  The town of Lysite has public receptors in addition to homes such as a store, restaurant, and library several small businesses.  There are no environmental receptors within the radius to endpoint.\n\nThe three propane receiver tanks are separated by at least 400 feet of "

Since the tanks are isolated from one another, each tank is evaluated independently for the worst case scenario and would release 50,000 pounds of propane.  According to the RMP Comp software, the distance to the endpoint from a receiver tank for 1 psi overpressure is 0.3 miles.  There are no private homes, public receptors, or environmental receptors within the distance to the endpoint form any of the three receiver tanks.  \n\nTrain 3 is a new facility, and operations are scheduled to begin by the end of August 2002.  Therefore, there have been no releases of H2S or accidents cause by a release of H2S from Train 3 (RMP Program 3 process).  The Lost Cabin Gas Plant has never had an accident involving propane (RMP Program 1 process) that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place. This facility complies with ASME code requirements, OSHA PSM, and state and local codes and regulations.\n\nThe plant personnel are equipped to control incipient fires and other emergencies.  Offensive efforts to fight fires beyond the incipient stage will be the responsibility of off-site fire departments.  They are authorized to take whatever actions are deemed necessary to protect lives and property.  In the event of an emergency involving these propane systems, the first line of defense will be to handle incipient type fires with plant personnel.  If the personnel on duty can not adequately stabilize and control the incident or if a fire has grown beyond the incipient stage, then emergency callout procedures will be initiated per the facility Emergency Response Plan.  The emergency callout procedure contains phone numbers of local emergency response agencies, such as Fremont County Emergency Management ? who has been advised and educated on potential events that might require their assistance.\n\nNo revisions are currently sche"
