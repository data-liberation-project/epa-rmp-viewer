The Facility Policy:\n       \n      The owners, management, and employees of Monke Bros. Fertilizer, Bennington Location, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n \n2.  Facility information:\n      \n      The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n       Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n        The maximum quantity stored would be 290,000 pounds in a number of tanks.  These include our two storage tanks, one holding 64,000 lbs and one holding 25,300 lbs, as well as 200,000 lbs in a number of nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tractor trailer holding approximately 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 64,000 pound, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.7 miles.\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose (2 inch).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n     \n       The facility has implemented the provisions of  ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, k-61.1? and the standards "

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n      Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor\n       \n      To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering  \n       in places, property damage, or environmental damage.\n        \n6.  The emergency action program:\n       \n      The facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan.\nb.  Coordinated with local authorities (local Fire Departments), the emergency planning and training.\nc.  A written emergency action program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR  1910.38, including employee training.\n\n7.   Safety improvement is an on going process at the facility.  Periodic reviews and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
