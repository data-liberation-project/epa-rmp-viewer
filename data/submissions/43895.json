Newell & Company is committed to providing a safe and healthful work environment for its employees, visitors and surrounding community.\n\nIt is important to establish emergency action plans to protect life and property.  Experience has shown that actions taken during an emergency are seldom effective unless planned in advance.  \n\nOur comprehensive accidental release prevention program demonstrates this commitment.  W. Newell has highly trained employees on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also have coordinated efforts with the Champaign Fire Department, who provides our emergency response service.  \n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Anhydrous Ammonia.  The maximum inventory that is expected to be present in this facility is 12,500 pounds.\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA, OSHA PSM standard 20 CFR 1910.119 and EPCRA Section 302.\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out this analysis is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nW. Newell maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available/accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Refresher training is provided annually or more frequently if needed.\n\nOur facility conducts highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage change in chemicals, technology, equipment and processes operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in operations, are promptly made aware of, and given training to deal with the modifications.\n\nPre-start up reviews related to new processes and to modify an established processes and to modify an established process are conducted as a regular practice at W. Newell.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nW. Newell conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rules are being implemented.  Those audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nW.

Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis, in particular.  \n\nOn occasion, W. Newell hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor\u00bfs safety performance is completed.  W. Newell has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractors work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of regulated substance occur.\n\nThis is a new facility, there are no reported accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nW. Newell is not included in the written community emergency response plan.  This facility has its own emergency response plan.  The emergency response plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release.  The emergency response plan includes information on emergency health care.\n\nThe local agency coordinating the facility emergency response plan is the Champaign Fire Department, 217-403-7200.  \n\nW.
