The corporate environmental compliance manager has been assigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and for ammonia refrigeration safety in particular since 1991.  Schwan's maintains 3 - shift coverage of emergency responders trained to the 24-hour technician level at all facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.\n\nThe Florence, KY facility manufactures frozen pizza. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at this facility.  Ammonia is the most efficient and environmentally compatible refrigerant available. Although it is toxic at high concentration and is an irritating gas, it is not a cumulative metabolic poison, does not cause cancer or other dread diseases and does not cause lasting environmental damage. \n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the EPA\u00bfs RMPComp program. All Schwan's manufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the definition of urban.  Two scenarios, Alternate Case and Worst Case, were developed for the Florence facility.  Specific descriptions of each scenario are contained within the Risk Management Plan that is kept at the facility.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe Florence, KY facility maintains a 3-shift emergency response team, trained at the 24-hour technician level. The team numbers 27 members. The training is conducted by the Corporate Environmental Compliance Manager. The training is designed with a heavy emphasis on ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, personal protective equipment up to use of Level `A' suits and interaction with an incident command system (ICS). Copies of emergency plans are filed with the Fire Department and annual facility walkthroughs are conducted with Fire Officers. Preplanned command posts and staging areas have been designated and Incident Command transfer and lia"

The Plant is fenced, a 24 hour/day, 7 days/week outside security contractor is on-site.  The facility refrigeration team is on-duty 24 hours/day, 7 days/week. \n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in the Schwan's corporate culture, improvements in system safety are implemented as a result of employee-based Total Quality Management (TQM) teams, a designated PSM team and as a result of system engineering modifications and extensions. Post incident debriefings and incident investigations are used to identify additional improvements to system safety."
