Its two water filtration plants, drawing from the Potomac and Patuxent rivers, produce an average of 166 million gallons of pure water per day, and over 5,000 miles of water mains deliver that product to homes and businesses in Prince Georges and Montgomery Counties.  The Commission operates three reservoirs, with a total capacity of 14 billion gallons, to ensure a reliable water supply for all seasons and conditions.\n    \nIV.    POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES \n\n    A six-member commission governs WSSC--three members from each county.  The Commissioners are appointed to four-year terms by their respective county executives, and confirmed by their county councils.\n\n    The Commissions powers and responsibilities are set forth in State law and in subsequent legislative amendments.  The Maryland General Assembly conferred these powers upon the WSSC to enable it to fulfill its principal functions.\n\n    The Commissions major functions are to:\n\nprovide for the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply and sanitary sewerage systems in Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties,\n\n-    approve the locations of, and issue permits for, utilities installed in public ways, and \n\n-    establish water consumption rates, sewer usage rates, connection charges, front foot benefit charges, and permit fees, and if required, cause ad valorem taxes to be  levied.\n\n    The Commission also:\n\n-    reviews preliminary subdivision plats as to suitability of water and sewer design, and reviews street grades for those streets in which there are Commission facilities,\n\n-    formulates regulations, issues permits for, and inspects all plumbing and gas fitting installations, and\n\n-    conducts examinations for master and journeyman plumbers and gas fitters, and issues licenses to those qualified to perform plumbing and gas fitting work.\n\nV.
