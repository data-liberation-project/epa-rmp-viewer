Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of West-Con are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and blended.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 37 tons.  \n\n\n\n3. Worst Case scenario/Alternative-case scenario\n\nThis facility has developed a worst case and an alternative-case scenario, however it has been withheld from this executive summary as a security sensitive information as requested by the EPA. \n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the storage and handling of the anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standard Instituted, Inc. and the standards of the US Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". In addition, Minnesota Department of Ag rules. \n\n\n\n5. The five-year history\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\n\n     A.    A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     B.
