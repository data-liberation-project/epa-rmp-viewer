The hydrocooler is equipped with four air-cooling evaporators (bare coils) and an accumulator for flooded operation.\n\n\n\nAll control valve groups are located in the the hallways which require lift-operated equipment for safe access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within two outdoor machinery areas that are surrounded by fencing in order to prevent unauthorized access. There are no vessels, piping or valves located on the roof. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nOutdoor Machinery Area\n\n(4) Screw compressors\n\n(4) Oil separators\n\n(2) High pressure receivers\n\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\n\n(1) Liquid recirculator\n\n(6) Evaporative condensers\n\n\n\nNorth Recirculator Area\n\n(1) Liquid recirculator\n\n(1) Drop leg vessel\n\n(1) Oil pot\n\n\n\nHydrocooler\n\n(1) Accumulator\n\n(4) Water-cooled evaporators (bare coils)\n\n\n\nFront Hallway\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling-suspended)\n\n\n\nBack Hallway\n\n(10) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling-suspended)\n\n\n\nNorth Hallway\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling-suspended)\n\n\n\nMiddle Hallway\n\n(2) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling-suspended)\n\n\n\nSouth Hallway\n\n(2) Air-cooling"

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to each high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe hydro-cooler flooded system operates as"

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to each high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is an ammonia detector installed inside the outdoor machinery area. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe. Also, a sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area that provides two-minute interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Sun World Bakersfield consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun World International facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 41,000lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSun World International has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nSun World International's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n?

Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Sun World International continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sun World International's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sun World International's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nSun World International has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun World International has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Sun World International now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"l"
