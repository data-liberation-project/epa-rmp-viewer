      "SummaryText": "PURPOSE\n\nBecouse of the use and storage of toxic chlorine in 150 pound cylanders,sometimes in quantities exceeding 2,500 pounds,the potential for a catastrofic release of chlorine gas exists,either by earthquake,fire,or by other means of natural or man made events.  It is therefore necessary to prepair and implement  a Risk Management Plan in conformance with 40 CFR 68,published June 20,1996.\n\n\nSpecial precautions for Chlorine safety\n\nAll operators are instructed to read,study,and understand the chlorine manual supplied by the chlorine instute.  The manual contains detailed information on the safe usage of chlorine and chlorine products.\n\n*  Inhalation of chlorine gas leaking from 150 pound cylanders,connections,or piping can cause serious respiratory tract irritation or injury,unconciousness,or death due to chlorine poisoning.  For this reason chlorine storage cylanders and piping (except solution piping) are confined to the chlorine applications room.  This room is equiped with a separate outside entrance and exhaust system.  This exhaust system is manually operated,however the air in the room is constantly monitored.  If gas concentrations reach 1.0 ppm,an alarm sounds outside the room.  There is an observation window so outside personnel can monitor work being performed inside the chlorine room.  Self contained breathing apparatus' and protective clothing are worn by all personnel while working in the chlorine room.\n\n\nPrecautions for chlorine handling\n\nA)  Chlorine must be handled by trained personnel only.\n\nB)  150 pound cylanders of chlorine must be handled carefully to avoid dropping or bumping them.\n\nC)  Cylanders must be stored in an upright position only.\n\nD)  The protective valve cap must not be removed until the cylander is in place and secured properly with   a safety chain.\n\nE)  No chlorine leaks should be tolerated.  All chlorine connections should be checked for leaks,any leaks detected,no matter how small,must be isolated and repaired immediately.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "F)  Always open chlorine valves slowly and carefully using a standard chlorine valve wrench.  Chlorine valves need to be turned only one full turn counter-clockwise to permit maximum chlorine discharge from the cylander.  A stuck chlorine valve can usually be opened by striking the end of the wrench with the open heel of the hand.  If a valve does not open in this manner,return it to the supplier for replacement.\n\nG)  When not withdrawing chlorine or when a cylander is empty,the valve must be closed.\n\nH)  Chlorine cylanders must be changed as soon as they become empty.\n\n I)  When a leak is detected,personnel entering the chlorine room must don protective clothing and a respiratory protective device (SCBA) before entering to perform work.\n\nJ)  Never store cylanders in direct sunlight or near sources of direct heat.\n\nK)  Storage room temperatures should be approximately 70 degrees fahrenheit.\n\nL)  Chlorine cylanders must never be used for storing anything except chlorine.\n\nM)  Chlorine safety instructions,regarding the safe handling of cylanders,must be posted on the safety bulletin board and in the chlorine room.\n\nN)  All 150 pound chlorine cylanders must have a protective cap fitted over the valve at all times.  Except when the cylander is in use and properly secured.\n\nO)  All cylanders must be secured with safety chains at all times.\n\nP)  Employees expected to handle chlorine cylanders and operate chlorine equipment must be trained in chlorine safety and chlorine hazards.\n\n\nEducation\n\n*  Only trained personnel are allowed to handle chlorine.  Training comes from several sources,these sources include:\n\nA)  The New York State Department Of Environmental Conservation operator training course whitch includes chlorine safety training.\n\nB)  The New York State Health Department Bureau Of Public Water Supply Protection water operator training course includes chlorine safety training.\n\nC)  Safety seminars,there are many satety seminars held in New York state each year.\n\nD) "

      "SummaryText": " In-plant training,safety meetings are held monthly for all personnel involved in handling chlorine.\n\nE)  Hands on training,twice each year exercises are held using the   safety kit and an empty chlorine  cylander.  The purpose of these exercises are to make all personnel involved in the handling of chlorine familiar with the procedures of safely shutting down a leaking cylander.\n\n*** This facility has not had an accident involving chlorine in the past.  We,as operators,know the dangers of chlorine,and handle it accordingly.  Our excelent safety record is the result of an excelent safety program,which has been developed through countless hours of training and diligence.\n\n\nFirst Responders\n\n*Since Police agencies are often dispatched before the nature of the problem is known,Police personnel are likely to be the first emergency services at the scene of an incedent involving a chlorine release.  They may arrive before Fire or other Emergency agencies.  If the Police officer is the first on the scene of a hazardous materials accident He/She will need to identify the chemical involved in the release.  Many chemicals can be lethal and explosions can occur before Fire departments reach the scene.  The Police officer may have to make decisions which will affect the lives of a great number of people.\n\n\nPhases of emergency response\n\n*  The response to,and control of,any emergency situation can be broken down into several phases.\nThe basic phases of response to a hazardous materials incedent involving chlorine would include:\n\n1)  Receipt of notification of the incident.\n\n2)  Initial response.\n\n3)  Arrival at the scene.\n\n4)  Types of situations encountered.\n\n5)  Recocnition of potential dangers.\n\n6)  Action - (evacuation,cordoning off,warning,etc.)\n\n7)  Determining the need for outside assistance.\n\n8)  Re-opening the area after the event is over.  There may be other considerations due to local conditions or special circumstances,but these basic phases will apply to most Police"

Depending on the situation,consideration may have to be given to wind direction,terrain,blocked access,and other factors.  Approach from upwind whenever possible even if it means a detour.  Try to keep apparatus and personnel uphill from the incident.  In case of ignition of of vapors,due to contact with incompatable substances,do not place apparatus close enough to be damaged.  Keep all unnecessary personnel out of the area.\n\n*  Life safety must be the prime consideration when making decisions at the scene of a hazardous materials incident involving chlorine.  Safety of rescue personnel must be assured since injury to fire fighters will compound the problem.  The officer in charge must size up the situation and determine if the situation can be controlled,if it cannot,the decision must be made to evacuate the area in the worst case scenario.\n\n*  Worst case release scenario\n\nA worst case release scenario at this facility could be a release of 150 pounds of chlorine at a rate of 8.25 pounds/minute for a duration of 10 minutes.  Mitigation measures would be release in an enclosed area in direct contact with outside air.  A toxic end point of 0.0087 mg/l at an estimated distance to end point of 0.3 miles(0.5km).  Assumptions used in this scenario are:  wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour (1.5meters/second),stability class F,and air temp. 77degrees F.(25 degrees C.).  Public receptors within the distance to end point are Schools,Hospitals,and Residances.\n\n*  Alternative case release scenario\n\nAn alternative case release scenario at this facility could be a release of 8.35 pounds/minute for a duration of 10 minutes.
