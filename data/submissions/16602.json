The Emergency Response Plan \n(Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was\ndesigned to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe emergency response procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and \nMitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation.  \nThis manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe AmeriCold Logistics Plant #80570 facility is located at 660 Fifth Street in Turlock, California.  The facility is \nsituated at the intersection of Firth Street and F Street, approximately one half-mile south of West Main Street.  The\nimmediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with residential areas primarily to the north and west.\n\nThe facility chills and stores a variety of food products such as fruit, fish, and poultry.  The facility operates the ammonia\nrefrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for storing these food products.  The facility was originally \nbuilt in 1953 Between 1956 and 1989 several additional cold storage rooms and an Instant Quick Freeze were added to \nincrease freezing and storage capacity.  The facility currently covers approximately 6.3 acres.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 25,000 pounds of ammonia for cold storage rooms and process equipment.  The \nmajority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted\n  on the engine room roof, the diffuser is located outside the engine room, and all of the "

HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\n           Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored In a vessel (accounting for \n           administrative controls) - 25,000 pounds In 10 minutes. Since the major vessels are Inside the engine room the building \n           was considered as a passive mitigation measure.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5    \n           meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The SLAB dispersion model was used to determine the maximum down \n  wind distance.\n\nDistance to Toxic Endpoint: The one hour, time averaged concentration of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/L) reached 2024\nmeters or 1.26 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of\nammonia released in one hour at this rate is 6000 pounds.  The meteorological conditions used were 3\nmeters/second wind speed, and D stability.  Reference Table 5 from the EPA RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis\nGuidance Document was used.\n\nDistance to Toxic Endpoint: The one hour, time averaged concentration of 200 ppm (0.1 4 mg/L) reached 369\nmeters or.32 miles.\n\nD. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n     STEPS\n\nThe facility operates In accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines\nand standards including the following:\n\n( IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Maidng Ammonia Refrigeration \n       Tie-ins\" \n( IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \n( IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n( IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nIn addition, the AmeriCold Logistics Plant #80570 has implemented a Proces"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years (June 21,1994 through\nJune 21,1999).\n\nF. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility.\n\n1.      In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will Immediately go to the nearest public address system and announce: \"ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - THERE IS AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION)\". A supervisor in the area will determine whether or not the building must be evacuated.\n\n2. If the building is to be evacuated, the Supervisor will announce over the public address system:\n\"ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - EVACUATE THE BUILDING.  WE HAVE AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION).  WALK ! DO NOT RUN!\"\n\n3.      Upon notification to evacuate the building, the management person closest to the alarm system will begin sounding the evacuation alarm (three short blasts on a portable alarm).  This alarm should be sounded for at least one minute or until it is evident all personnel are aware of the evacuation.\n\n4.      The Supervisor on duty will immediately (upon hearing the alarm) call 911 to report the leak and give the address of the facility.  He or she will then evacuate the building.\n\n5.    Employees will begin exiting  the building as per the published evacuation plan, and report to the proper area outside the building for a head count.\n\n6.       All Shift Supervisors will report to their assigned areas and perform a head count.\n\n7.       After a complete head count, each Supervisor will report the results of the head count to the person in charge of the plant. The person in charge of the plant will give the approximate working area for any persons not accounted for to the Fire Chief.\n\n8. When the alarm is over, the Fire Department will determine the extent of the damage, the clean-up"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n         There were several recommendations resulting from the development of the PSM/RMP document including recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis and Off-Site Consequence Analysis studies. These Teams made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety at the facility. These recommendations are expected to be implemented by May 1999 and are listed as follows: \n\n  Implementation Schedule of Recommended Actions\n\n  R-01  Install ammonia sensors that are more reliable than the currently used Sierra monitors.  Test all sensors     \n           quarterly or as suggested by the manufacturer.\n\n    R-02  Connect the new ammonia sensors in R-01 to the off-Site alarm monitoring company (ADT).\n\n  R-03   Have the new ammonia sensors in R-01 that monitor the high pressure side of the system (e.g. in the engine    \n             room) shut the liquid solenoid valve on High Pressure"
