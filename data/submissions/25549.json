FACILITY POLICY\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF THE LOWE FERTILIZER PLANT AND ELEVATOR, GARDEN CITY CO-OP, INC. ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AUTHORITIES TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITIES AT THE THE FACILITY ARE TO RECIEVE, STORE, AND MERCHANDIZE GRAIN, TO STORE, SELL, AND OR CUSTOM APPLY DRY AND LIQUID FERTILIZERS, TO STORE AND SELL AND OR CUSTOM APPLY CROP HERBICIDES AND INSECTICIDES, AND THE STORAGE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA TO BE SOLD TO FARMERS FOR CROP PRODUCTION.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 260,000 # IN TWO 30,000 GALLON TANKS.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n     A.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE CONTENTS OF ONE OF THE STORAGE TANKS RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 #, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF ONE OF THE STORAGE TANKS AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200PPM) IS 2.40 MILES.\n     B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.83 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1 PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC., AND STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1919.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\n5.
