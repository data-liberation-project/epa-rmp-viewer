The incident resulted from a burst pipe caused by extreme cold weather. It was extinguished in approximately 90 minutes, with no injury to personnel and limited onsite impact. As a precaution, local responders closed nearby roads and a precautionary shelter in place was executed offsite. Offsite responders were standing by to provide back-up firefighting assistance.\n\nAir monitoring did not detect any environmental release off site during or after the incident.

The unit was immediately shut down and the fire from the residual gas being burned was extinguished within 15 minutes.  There was no injury to personnel and the onsite impact was limited to damage to the affected equipment.

The processes are broken down into the following: (1) existing petroleum refinery process units including petroleum refinery tankage; (2) alkylation unit; (3) FCC unit; and (4) newly established renewable assets. CMR has decided to modify their plan to include all process units as covered due to the plant\u2019s interconnectivity and the co-location of the various processing units.  This change to the plan captures process units that may exceed flammable and toxic threshold quantities but also other units that are interconnected and co-located. \n\nThis submission updates the MII for flammables from 1,261,000 lbs to 353,535 lbs. The decrease reflects that the prior submittal combined all LPG tanks.

Calumet Montana Refining, LLC (CMR) has a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of our community, workers and protection of the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in incident prevention, including training personnel, promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and mitigate the release. CMR has developed and continuously implements its Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Program (RMP) to mitigate potential risks throughout the useful life of its equipment. This Risk Management Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED [40 CFR 68.155 (b)]\n\nCMR operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (i.e., propane, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, asphalt products, etc.) from raw crude oil. The refinery handles several regulated flammables including propane, butane, isobutane, ethane, N-pentane, isopentane, etc. In addition, the refinery utilizes hydrofluoric acid which is a regulated toxic substance. These substances may exist in pure form or, more commonly, as part of mixtures in varying concentrations. \n\nIn addition to the petroleum products, In late 2022, CMR began modifying portions of existing assets and building new processes at the Great Falls facility to process up to 15,000 barrels per stream day (\u201cbpsd\u201d) of renewable feedstocks (e.g., seed oils, used cooking oil, tallow, etc.) to produce low-emission sustain"
