The Facility Plan\n\n    The owners, management, and employees of Farley Ag Services, L.L.C. are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize  the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n  2.  Facility Information\n\n    -The primary activity at this facility is the storage and distributing of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed.\n\n    -The maximum quantity stored would be 128,200 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n   3.  The Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n     a.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over a 10 minute period. The maximum quantity released would be 128,200 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 75 percent capacity which is a voluntary limit as per the facility RMP. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 6.6 miles.\n\n      b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a relief valve. The distance to endpoint, (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1 mile.\n\n    4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n       The facility will implement the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.\n\n     5.  The Five Year Accident History\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years as this is a newly proposed facility.\n\n     6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\n        Farley Ag Services, L.L.C. will:\n\n        a.  have an emergency action plan coordinated with Platte Co LEPC."

Planned Changes to Improve  Safety\n\n        Safety improvements will be an on-going process at the facility. We will conduct yearly safety meetings, safety equipment checks, and check emergency spill equipment procedures. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time."
