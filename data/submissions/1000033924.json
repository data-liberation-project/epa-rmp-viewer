We willingly observe the most stringent industry safety precautions to prevent hazards in the workplace. City management and water operations staff have instituted procedures to ensure a safe working environment is maintained that emphas proper handling and containment of hazardous materials. The City's safety planning also emphas prevention of a release of toxic substances into the environment. And in the unlikely event of a release, the plan identifies in-house and community-based expertise which will be called upon to minimize the impact to the community.\r\n     Public Well No. 5 is located in the northwest sector of Hermiston just .3 miles west of U.S. Hwy 395 in Umatilla County, Oregon. Disinfection of water is accomplished through chlorination with chlorine gas. Well No.5 falls under EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations due to the storage and use of chlorine gas for chlorination. Well No.5 currently stores a maximum of 4,000 lbs of chlorine in pressurized one-ton containers.\r\n     No accidents associated with the storage of chlorine gas at Well No.5 have occurred since its construction in 1979. An extensive Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) of the worst case scenario and alternative release scenario has been performed with the aid of the EPA's RMP*CompO and other EPA guidance documentation.\r\n\r\n The City of Hermiston Public Well No.5 falls under Prevention Program 3. The City has prepared an extensive and informative documentation package that covers all the elements addressed under Prevention Program 3 requirements. The City also provides extensive training for all employees who work on the chlorination process, including emphasis on stringent procedures for maintaining the integrity of the chlorination equipment. Well No. 5 is continuously monitored f"

There have been a few changes implemented to the original chlorination process since Well No.5 was built in 1979, including the addition of audio/visual alarms, wind sock, and chlorine detection alarms linked to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA).  Also, updated equipment has been installed and general improvements made to the system. In-place safety plans will take every precaution so that any future change deemed necessary will be correctly designed, constructed, and operated.\r\n\r\n     The City of Hermiston has created a focused Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that will be followed in the event of an accidental release of chlorine at Well No. 5. Employees are trained in the procedures of this EAP to ensure its policies are quickly and effectively implemented in an emergency. Coordination with Hermiston Fire & Emergency Services and the Oregon State Regional Hazmat Team constitutes significant elements of this EAP. The Stae Of Oregon regional Hazmat team is based out of Hermiston.\r\n\r\n     We believe the outstanding safety record of the City of Hermiston and Well No.5 related to chlorine gas will continue. The City's focus will continue to be maintenance of a safe working environment for it's employees and protection of the community."
