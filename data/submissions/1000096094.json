These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nYork Cold Storage is a facility in York, NE which has two separate refrigeration systems.  Both engine rooms accommodate pet food processing operations.  \n\n\n\nWarehouse #3's ammonia refrigeration system is operated as a two-stage system.  On the low stage portion of the system, a low temperature accumulator operating at -30?F pumps liquid to freezers, blast room and ice room located in the plant.

The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the evaporators to the accumulator via a suction header.\n\n\n\nVapor from the low temperature accumulator is fed to booster compressors. The compressed vapor from the booster compressors is sent to an intercooler operating at +10?F.  \n\n\n\nVapor from the intercooler is then fed to the high stage compressors.  During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to an evaporative condenser where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid.  The high-pressure liquid is collected in a high-pressure receiver.  The liquid collected in the high-pressure receiver provides liquid make-up for the accumulators.\n\n\n\nA portion of the high pressure liquid is sent to the intercooler where it is subcooled.  The subcooled liquid feeds various processing evaporators in the plant.  The subcooled ammonia liquid flows across the evaporators where it picks up heat from the product, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the evaporators to the high temperature accumulator via a suction header.  This vapor is also fed to the high stage compressors as stated above. \n\n\n\nThe Plate Freezer Processing Engine Room's ammonia refrigeration system is operated as a two-stage system.

Training shall include escape routes, notification of appropriate response agencies, instructions on activating a building fire alarm system and what should be done after evacuating a building. The evacuation alarm and emergency evacuation procedures will be tested no less than once per year. The decision of when to practice evacuating the building will rest with the Plant Engineer, Chuck Byers. Arrangements have been made to coordinate York Cold Storage's Emergency Action Plan and applicable emergency services with the following local agencies:\n\n\n\nYork County Emergency Management \n\n402-362-7744\n\n\n\nYork Police Department\n\n402-363-2640\n\n\n\nYork Fire Department\n\n402-363-2610\n\n\n\nUpon discovering an emergency situation, all employees shall immediately notify their shift supervisor or the Maintenance Department using the phone, vocally or wireless phones. The supervisor of the affected area should immediately contact the shift Maintenance personnel to determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action.  If the emer"

The shift supervisor will sound an evacuation alarm, and then determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area and will be relayed to the Employees.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor.  Once everyone has evacuated the facility and arrived at their designated meeting area, a head count must be conducted by the Shift Supervisor to account for missing people, including visitors and/or contractors in his/her area. \n\n\n\nMaintenance employees who work with the ammonia system or respond to releases are allowed to work with the Haz Mat personnel to take actions to stop a release. In the event of an emergency release of ammonia it will be necessary for some specifically assigned and properly trained employees to remain in work areas that are being evacuated long enough to perform critical operations. Before a maintenance employee enters a release area, they must first test the concentration of the release by using an ammonia detector. They must also operate in pairs. If the isolation is within their reasonable capabilities, they may isolate the leak and shut down the system if needed.\n\n\n\nIn response to an ammonia release, York Cold Storage will not respond to releases of hazardous chemicals in an offensive manner. The facility does not have any employees trained at the HAZMAT Technicians or First Responders Operations Level.  However, in the case of a minor ammonia release, designated maintenance personnel are allowed to isolate or maintain the release.\n\n\n\nYork Cold Storage has not had any accidental releases to report since the commissioning of the plant"

Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.22 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:    \n\n-Worst case weather conditions are uncommon,\n\n-Industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels\n\n-Ammonia is not corrosive in this service\n\n-Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel\n\n-The accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing and replacement of equipment, if necessary\n\n-Installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks\n\n-Alarms in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets\n\n-The emergency action plan and equipment in place at the facility\n\n"
