To meet this commitment, we have established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this plant.  One component of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at the Lamberti Synthesis USA Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our RMP.  Section 2 of this executive summary describes the substances currently used at the Lamberti Synthesis USA Plant in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n1.  A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequence of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule \u00bf see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule \u00bf see Section 4 of this executive summary\n3.

In fact, we have a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and against the injuries and damage that could occur from accidental releases.\n\nLimited use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.  Before using a substance regulated by the RMP rule (\u00bfregulated substance\u00bf), we considered less hazardous alternatives.  Once it was determined that we should use a regulated substance, we considered the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, contractors, the public, and the environment, and we have taken steps to minimize or prevent any such effects.\n\nPreventing releases of the regulated substances used at the plant.  When a regulated substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Government and corporate standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release, including contacting the local agency responsible for responding to accidental releases (e.g., the Local Emergency Planning Committee [LEPC] in association with the Fire Department Emergency Response Team) if emergency response actions are necessary.  We work closely with the LEPC and Fire Department to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.\n\nOur safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTIO"

We take appropriate steps to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, (2) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process, and (3) programs to evaluate the hazards of our process.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we will strive to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or damage to the environment.  We will provide response training to our personnel, including working with the LEPC and other responding agencies when executing emergency response actions, so that they are well prepared to respond in the event of an emergency situation.\n\n2.  REGULATED SUBSTANCES USED BY THE LAMBERTI SYNTHESIS USA PLANT\n\nThe Lamberti Synthesis USA Plant has three substances (ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and ethylenediamine), which may not all be on-site at the same time, in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the RMP rule.  The three substances are covered as toxic materials by the RMP rule.\n\n3.  OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we perform an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental releases that could affect the public or the environment.  In accordance with the regulations, we evaluated one worst-case and three more realistic (but still highly unlikely) alternative release scenarios for the polyhydric alcohol process.\n\nWe do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  This scenario is designed to estimate the maximum possible area that could be affected by a release of the substance with the highest potential impact from our plant, but it is not a realistic scenario.

The alternative release scenarios were selected to represent more realistic releases that might occur at a plant like the Lamberti Synthesis USA Plant.\n\nThe main objective for performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects on the public might occur because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  For a release of a toxic material, the toxic endpoint is defined by EPA as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\n\nResults of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios have been reported to the EPA and made available to the LEPC and other emergency responding agencies through this RMPlan.\n\n4.  ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe have developed a comprehensive prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) process safety management (PSM) regulation.  For the Lamberti Synthesis USA Plant, the prevention program requirements of the EPA\u00bfs RMP rule are also satisfied by this PSM program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\n\n4.1  Prevention Program\nOur accident prevention program for the polyhydric alcohol process consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.  Process Safety Information.  We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an emergency response action plan, to ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our plant.

We ensure that this process safety information is available to our employees.\n2.  Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update a process hazard analysis of our polyhydric alcohol process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that will improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the polyhydric alcohol process.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience.  The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the polyhydric alcohol process.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the system are implemented.  This analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n3.  Operating procedures.  Our engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to polyhydric alcohol process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\na.Steps for safely conducting activities\nb.Applicable safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of deviations\nc.Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substances occurs\n4.

Classroom training and demonstration are used to help train employees.  Oral reviews and demonstrations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can work on the polyhydric alcohol process.\n5.  Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.   Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our process.\n6.  Management of change.  We have a written procedure to review and approve all proposed changes to the polyhydric alcohol process including chemical class, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does no negatively affect safe operations.  All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are approved by engineering and management.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n7.  Pre-startup safety review.  We perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.  This review confirms that: \na.Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\nb.Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place;\nc.Employee training has been completed; and \nd.For a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new, or management o"

One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  We have a program to perform compliance audits of our polyhydric alcohol process every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the process.  This audit is performed by an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the polyhydric alcohol process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n9.  Incident investigation.  We have a program to investigate any incidents or near misses that could reasonably result in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We communicate to our employees the requirement to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  In the event of an incident, an investigation team would be assembled, and the investigation would be initiated as soon as possible, but always within 48 business hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n10.  Employee participation.  We have a written employee participation program for our covered process to help ensure that the safety concerns of our employees are addressed.  We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the plant.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\n11.  Hot work permits.  We have a hot work permit prog"

We reviewed OSHA\u00bfs fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation.\n12.  Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities related to the polyhydric alcohol process are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.  Contractors are required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at our plant.  For small projects this training is usually conducted by Lamberti Synthesis USA personnel.  We routinely verify that this training has been provided.\n\n4.2  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.\n\nBoth ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are delivered in railcars that must be approved by the Department of Transportation.  The storage tanks and equipment are designed and maintained to standard established by the federal government and by industry.  Remote isolation valves that can be close quickly if a release occurs, manual shutoff valves, excess flow devices on the railcars, and process area detectors with alarms are also provided as process controls that are in place to help prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous materials from the system.\n\n5.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\n\nAlthough Lamberti Synthesis USA Plant personnel will not respond to significant releases of hazardous substances, we have established a written emergency response action plan to help facilitate the evacuation of our employees and to ensure the safety of outside emergency responders who could be called on to respond to any accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\na.Informing local emergency responders about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\nb.Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\nc.Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\nd.Reviewing and updating the emergency response action plan\n\nWe have trained our employees to recognize and report emergency situations.  All of our personnel and contractors are trained in evacuation procedures.  The LEPC is responsible for notifying the public of the emergency situation, if necessary.  Lamberti Synthesis USA Plant personnel will maintain a regular dialogue with local emergency planners.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe are dedicated to continuous improvement of the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.  All recommendations received by the plant manager are evaluated and implemented if safety can significantly be improved.  Standard operating and safety procedures for the covered process are reviewed periodically to ensure that they are correct, and we provide training to our employees and contractors on a wide variety of safety and operation topics."
