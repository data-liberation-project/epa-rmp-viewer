This commitment is demonstrated by the  resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.   If, in spite of all precautions, a  release does occur, Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nNovolyte Performance Materials, LLC manufactures, processes and stores specialty chemicals in Zachary, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana and evaluated the facility to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded threshold quantities.  Based on process knowledge, Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The facility uses six regulated substances in five separate processes.  The chemicals and largest quantity on site (either as largest quantity in a single process or total quantity of mixtures) are: ethyl chloride (74,000 lbs); formaldehyde (60,000 lbs); methyl chloride (220,000 lbs); phosphorus tricloride (88,000 lbs); and 2-methylpropene (50,000 lbs.).\n\n\n\nIn addition, Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2869).  Therefore, the five Ferro Baton Rouge processes are classified as Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances:      The endpoint for the worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 pound per square inch (psi) over pressure (i.e., 15"

      "SummaryText": ".7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.    The distances to the endpoint of 1 psi over pressure for the worst-case release of 2-methylpropene using the EPA lookup table is 0.27 miles.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances:      Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the three regulated toxic substances at Ferro Baton Rouge was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  Based on the EPA lookup tables, a worst-case release of methyl chloride results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately 3 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternative release scenarios are: a release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances:     A single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for ethyl chloride as follows.  A 2-inch nozzle on the ethyl chloride tank breaks off, allowing release of the contents into the tank dike.  The ethyl chloride will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.   The distance to the 1 psi over pressure endpoint for the alternative-case release of ethyl chloride using the EPA lookup table is 0.20 miles.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances:    One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for the regulated toxic substances at Novolyte P"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nNovolyte Performance Materials, LLC Baton Rouge primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.   To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do "
