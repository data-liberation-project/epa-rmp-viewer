Johnston's will also ensure that employees recieve the necessary training and that proper safety equipment is provided.  Johnston's will also make sure that the surrounding sommunity is aware of our preparedness in the event of an accident.\n\nJohnston's Renfrow facility is a full service, country elevator, which sells feed, seed, fertilizer, as well as agricultural chemicals.  The only substance subject to regulation under RMP and above the threshold quantities in anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed from our facility as a crop fertilizer only.  OUr facility has one storage tank that has 12,000 gallons capacity and is filled to only 85%, this equals 56,000 pounds of ammonia.  We also have sixteen (16) 1,000 gallon Nurse tanks also filled to a maximum of 85% full at our location.  The combined capacity of all tanks at this location is 28,000 gallons or 131,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThis facility has a \"site-safety coordinator\", all Johnston coordinators are given training to monitor the d"

The site safety coordinator acts as the emergency contact.\n\nAs required by EPA guidelines, the following worst-case release and alternative release scenarios have been devised.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impacts, and would travel 0.84 miles.  It should be noted that Johnston's has never had a release of an entire stationary anhydrous ammonia storage tank from any of its locations.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would be in the failure of a one-inch transfer hose of approximately 2901 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a two-minute period.  Under the worst weather conditions the contents would travel 0.22 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  It should be noted that Johnston's has not had a release of this type from any facility in the past.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standards, OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, chack valves, relief valves, and manual shut-offs.

      "SummaryText": " of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves to stop the flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails.  All main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia facility is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees al least annually, whenever there is change in the process, or whenever comptency with the regulations is questioned.  The training sonsists of classroom lecture, current vidoes, testing and certification, and on the job training.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThis facility had a reportable accident occuring on 07-17-1998.  The release began at 5:30 a.m. and lasted for one hour and 15 minutes.  This anhydrous ammonia release was the result of an unknown factor causing a valve to malfunction.  This release resulted in $3600 in damages to off-site trees and landscaping.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local agencies by providing information and offering tours to ensure that they are familiar with are are properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will ensure that the community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nJohnston Grain has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for our facilities that includes provisions for public notification, initial medical care, evacuations, and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE"
