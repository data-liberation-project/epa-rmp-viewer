This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  Energy Transfer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Bear Den Processing Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Bear Den Processing Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\nThe facility is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant that is designed to process natural gas. Bear Den Plant 1 is designed for 30 MMSCFD and Bear Den Plant 2 is designed for 120 MMSCFD. The facility consists of the following: inlet gas separation and filtration, inlet compression, dehydration, condensate stabilization, glycol regeneration systems, cryogenic processing units, refrigeration systems, stabilizer overhead compression, residue compression, hot oil systems, flare system, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in three 500-barrel atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGLs from the cryogenic units are stored in eight 90,000-gallon bullet tanks and can be loaded into tanker trucks for shipment or sent offsite via pipeline. Natural gas from residue compression is sent offsite via p"

The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture. \n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Bear Den Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility.  \n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Bear Den Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.\tTanks are gauged\n2.\tTanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n3.\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\n4.\tFacility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week \n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.\tBerms around tanks\n2.\tProcess relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\n3.\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n4.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\n5.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.\tTrained emergency response personnel\n2.\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n3.\tSPCC Plan\n4.\tFire extinguishers\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Bear Den Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable subst"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Bear Den Processing Plant is coordinated with the McKenzie County LEPC.  The contact for Emergency Management for the McKenzie County and can be reached at (701) 444-7483.  The Bear Den Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. Energy Transfer operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Watford City Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Energy Transfer conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Bear Den Processing Plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substance in the facility.  \n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\nThe Bear Den Processing Pl"
