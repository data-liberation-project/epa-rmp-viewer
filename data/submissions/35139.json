Frozen fish, harvested from the North Atlantic for the most part, arrives in bulk from other locations.  The fish is cut and formed into various products (fish sticks, filets, etc.), breaded, seasoned, cooked, and then quickly frozen to maintain its quality and safety.  After packaging, the product is stored in our refrigerated warehouse facility until shipped to the customer.\n\nMost large refrigerated facilities use a chemical called anhydrous ammonia as a vital part of the refrigeration system.  Ammonia performs the same functions as the hydrochlorofluorocarbon - Freon refrigerants used in home air conditioners, refrigerators, automobiles, etc. Ammonia is the most environmentally friendly, energy- and capital-efficient refrigerant available for industrial applications; Freons are not suitable for many industrial uses.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used widely as a fertilizer, both for direct injection into the ground and for manufacture of other fertilizers.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, it is considered a hazardous material.\n\nIcelandic USA, Inc. is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes the ammonia refrigeration system.  To further safety in our facility, the refrigeration system is constructed under permit from local authorities, such as the building and fire departments.  Additionally, we adhere where appropriate to industry-consensus codes and standards, including the ASHRAE Safety Code for Refrigeration and the IIAR-2 standard of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the Maryland Oc"

In addition to professional design and installation to accepted engineering standards, Icelandic USA, Inc. has an Process Safety Management Program which includes active PSM team and updated PSM manual.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\nIcelandic, USA, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan, coordinated with local emergency response and management agencies, to ensure that the facility is properly prepared and equipped to respond to a fire or an unplanned discharge of ammonia (or other hazardous substance).  The plan addresses the action that will be taken and describes the various elements that are critical to ensure the safety of individuals in and around the facility.  \n\nThrough our Process Safety Management program, i.e, PSM team, meet regularly to discuss and review the elements the PSM manual to ensure safety in our facility."
