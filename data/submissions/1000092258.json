Humboldt, Tennessee facility management shall implement\n\nrequirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson Foods, Inc. employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing standardized operating procedures, training for employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all Tyson Farms, Inc. owned activities at this facility. Tyson Farms, Inc. management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this plan.\n\n2.    Facility Description\n\nTyson Farms, Inc. has built a new facility at this location for Poultry Processing. The process will slaughter chickens and convert them to a finished product for shipment.\n\nSeveral chemicals are used on-site, but only one (Anhydrous Ammonia) that exceeds the threshold quantity for the Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68). Ammonia is used as a refrigerant and is located in the Engine Room, and adjacent areas as well as the Blast Tunnels and Freezer. Air cooling in production areas will be accomplished using glycol as a secondary coolant.\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThe Tyson , Inc. Humboldt, TN facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent releases of hazardous materials, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to employees of the facility, the public and the environment.\n"

Tyson Foods, Inc. has developed and documented these elements in their Process Safety Management program (PSM). Employee participation in the release-prevention program is encouraged and supported by Tyson Farms, Inc. management. Key personnel are responsible for conducting process hazard analyses (PHA) and implementing the findings from these analyses for the ammonia system. Tyson Farms, Inc. programs ensure process safety are integrated in all aspects of operation beginning with construction and installation of new equipment, systems, and facilities, maintenance of these systems and changes to these systems. Tyson Farms, Inc. maintains documentation of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release. Tyson Farms, Inc. is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures. Each new employee is provided comprehensive operations and safety training during their initial orientation to the facility for their job duties. In addition, Tyson Foods, Inc. conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year. Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel related to the system for which they are responsible. This includes PPE training and qualification.\n\n4.    Five Year Accident History\n\nThis is a new facility, so there is no accident history within the last 5 years.\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nTyson Farms, Inc. Humboldt, TN facili"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral Engineering design elements have been incorporated into the construction of this facility to improve the safety of this system, including use of glycol as a secondary coolant in production areas instead of directly cooling with ammonia, and routing discharge from all Safety Relief Valves in the system to an ammonia diffusion tank to mitigate off site consequences of SRV activation.\n\n"
