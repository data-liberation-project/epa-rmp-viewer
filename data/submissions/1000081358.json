It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Stanwood Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Cedar County LEPC will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Stanwood, Iowa location is Adam Horman, location manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n\n\nAdam Horman, Location Manager \n\nWork:    563-942-3365 \n\n24-hour: 563-357-3336\n\n\n\nMark Dewell, Regional Manager \n\nWork:    563-942-3365 \n\n24-hour: 563-357-5904\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT RIVER VALLEY COOPERATIVE, STANWOOD, IOWA:\n\n\n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " site consists of semi transport trailer parking and seasonal anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks. From time-to-time throughout the year, numerous portable nurse tanks are present at this site. Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. The FTEs for this company location is ten (10).\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) semi transport trailer when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program, the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a vessel leak from a liquid valve. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valves. \n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Stanwood, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons in Stanwood.  An evacuation plan is in place.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard CGA-most current copy with amendments and State law.\n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, River Valley Cooperative has extended to the Stanwood Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia site, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrou"

In the unlikely event that the Stanwood Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Stanwood location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Stanwood has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned (River Valley Response Team, Linn County HAZMAT).  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Cedar County LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia site. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working on anhydrous ammonia make routine observations prior to use of equipment.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the equipment which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire.  Finally, the company routinely invites"
