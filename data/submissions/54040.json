The facility treats and cleans produced and ?frac? water from oil and gas fields in southwest Wyoming.  The stationary sources of regulated substance are:\r\n\r\n1. Two (2) 12,150 gallon storage tanks of 37 percent hydrochloric acid (HCl) and associated piping.  If the tanks were filled to 100 percent capacity, the result would be a maximum of 24,300?gallons or 241,168?pounds (lbs) of HCl, which is above the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold of 15,000 lbs.  Tanks will not be filled more than 90?percent of capacity (217,051 lbs maximum).  HC1 is separately introduced at different injection points along the water treatment system and never mixed with any other chemicals prior to injection into a one-million gallon bioreactor tank, where it is used for pH control.  GE Water & Process Technologies has provided the facility a ZeeWeed Wastewater Treatment System designed to treat an average daily flow of 820?U.S. gallons per minute (gpm) of wastewater to produce high-quality water for discharge to a nearby river.  This wastewater treatment system consists of a Bioreactor for the ZeeWeed system; two (2) ZeeWeed trains, each with five (5)?ZW 500D cassettes containing 48 modules; backpulse system; system Aeration equipment; Clean In Place (CIP) equipment; chemical dosing equipment; reverse osmosis (RO) pre-treatment equipment; two (2) single pass, two-stage RO units, each containing 85?membrane modules; and three (3) boron exchange pressure vessels.\r\n2. One 12,000 liquid gallon anhydrous ammonia (NH3) tank and associated piping.  Maximum fill of 90% would result in 55,620 lbs of anhydrous ammonia, which is above the EPA RMP threshold of 10,000 lbs.  The ammonia injection system starts with the storage tank.  From this storage tank, the ammonia gas f"

This vaporization system is pressure controlled to ensure constant ammonia feed.  At the bioreactor tank, raw feed water enters through an inlet valve, maintaining a level set point.  The bioreactor tank is equipped with coarse bubble diffusers through which air from aeration blowers is pumped, along with NH3, to aid the biological process. The NH3 is mixed into dilution via these course bubble diffusers with the raw feed water.  This process provides nitrogen nutrient in order for the bioliquor to sustain aerobic biological activity.\r\nThe Jensen Facility Prevention Program complies with 40 CFR ?68 (Clean Air Act 112(r)) Risk Management Program 3, CFR ?29 1910.119 OSHA PSM rules, and is in compliance with 40 CFR ?112 SPCC Plan regulations.  The facility has implemented a site specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) consistent with the approach in the National Response Team?s Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (One Plan) and includes the following elements:\r\n1. Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases; \r\n2. Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures;\r\n3. Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\r\n4. Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance; \r\n5. Training for all employees in relevant procedures; and\r\n6. Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the ERP to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that employees are informed of changes. \r\nWorst case scenario calculations were based upon HCl storage tank failure resulting in a liquid spill and vaporization of 240,000 lbs of HCl using RMP*Comp software and ammonia"
