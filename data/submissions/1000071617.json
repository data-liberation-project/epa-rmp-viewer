The plan encompasses aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Emergency response planning is coordinated with the Nueces County LEPC, the Refinery Terminal Fire Company, local law enforcement, the Corpus Christi Fire Department and area hospitals. In addition, the plan is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\nThe Corpus Christi Complex has implemented an emergency equipment inspection, testing and maintenance program which ensures that emergency response equipment will operate properly when needed.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nEquistar is working in conjunction with the Nueces County LEPC to increase public awareness and communication in the event of a chemical release. This includes a public education effort undertaken along with other Corpus Christi industries as well as improved electronic communications (such as text messages and automated phone calls) to promote rapid dissemination of information."

Pre-start up safety reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe and environmentally compliant startup prior to placing the modification into operation.  Following mechanical completion, and prior to start-up, a Pre-Start-Up Safety Review is required whenever physical changes to process or equipment is made.  For changes that cannot be installed without being immediately put in service (e.g. instrument range change, DCS control change) the pre-start up review and installation are done concurrently.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nCompliance audits are routinely conducted at the CCO facility to identify system improvement opportunities and incorporate applicable best practices.  Audits conducted at the site consist of internal self-assessments, corporate audits and third-party audits.  Additionally, the audits identify best practices to improve existing systems. As an OSHA VPP worksite, Equistar conducts annual audits. Corporate and site auditing standards and procedures, which covers numerous business aspects (RMP, maintenance, operations, safety, health & environmental, PSM, etc.) are audited on a routine schedule. Any identified corrective actions required as a result of the audits are inputted into an electronic corporate-wide tracking system to ensure adequate and timely completion and agreement with site Leadership. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nEquistar CCO has a Total Incident Reporting, Investigation and Closure system and procedure.

CCO's goal is to promptly report, investigate, and follow up on incidents, to help prevent recurrence and to ensure timely closure of incident investigation recommendations. Facility incident reporting is consistent both with sustaining a culture where people are not penalized or disciplined for reporting an incident while complying with relevant Human Resources policies and procedures. \r\n\r\nEquistar investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or upset release of a hazardous material. These investigations, using Apollo Root Cause Analysis or similar root cause investigation method, are conducted to identify the specific causes, as well as identify corrective actions to help prevent similar reoccurrences.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nEquistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\nEquistar is a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program. As a VPP Star Work Site, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nEquistar utilizes contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and processes. Resident contractors are trained and must comply with our procedures at a minimum. All site contractors, including non-resident contractors are informe"

The Crude C4 material is transported to the CCO Dock via pipeline transfers. \r\n\r\nThe regulated substances handled at the site are propane, isobutane, butane, 1-butene, 1,3 butadiene, ethyl acetylene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-butene-cis and 2-butene-trans. \r\n \r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard. A number of processes at Equistar are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. During periodic turnarounds and projects, enhancements are implemented to better ensure plant operations remain within specific operating parameters. These safeguards also further reduce the potential for catastrophic failures during periods of excursions outside parameters.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit PHA. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.
