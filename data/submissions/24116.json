Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Berne Coop (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for crop production nutrients.\n    Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one 30,000 gallon and one 26,000 gallon \n    storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be about\n354,577 pounds, including about 27 - 1,000 gallon \"nurse\" tanks.\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \nreleased as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would \nbe 130,050 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 \npercent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point \n(point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.12 miles.  \n     \nb.The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \nThe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.6 miles. The \nammonia would also leak at a rate of 13,320 pounds per minute.  \n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Stand"

Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and \n    community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n    \n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia and propane for implementation at this time.  "
