Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nSeadrift Coke, L.P. is located on Texas Highway 185 South, 0.5 mile south of the intersection of Texas State Highway 185 and Highway 35, Port Lavaca, Texas 77979. Our facility consists of one delayed coker and a rotary kiln. The primary product is calcined petroleum needle coke produced from decant oil feedstock. Byproducts from the coking process are gas oil, naphtha, light coker naphtha and fuel gas. Naphtha, light coker naphtha and fuel gas are regulated flammable substances. The other regulated substance is chlorine, which is used for water treatment.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS:\n\nDescription of Hazard Analysis and offsite consequence on file. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS:\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental prevention program in place at Seadrift Coke, LP. Since all the processes subject to the EPA RMP regulation are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATION:\nIt is the policy of Seadrift Coke, LP to encourage and provide opportunities for all employees to participate in the design, implementation of our Operational Manangement System (OMS) effort. Opportunities for participation range from updating and compilation of technical documents, participating as members of various safety and program management teams"

These teams typically consists of employees from various areas of the plant, including production, maintenance, safety, and plant management. While participation is voluntary, to provide the broadest possible involvement team membership may be required as a condition of employment. All information gathered and developed, as part of the accident prevention program is readily available to all employees. The employee participation policy is maintained and accessible to all employees on the plant computer.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION:\n\nSeadrift Coke, L.P. maintains technical documents that are used in maintaining a safe operation. These documents address key process parameters, equipment design basis/configuration, chemical properties and associated hazards. Processes are maintained within limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instruments systems (e.g. automated shutdowns systems). Chemical-specific information, including emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS), which are available throughout the plant and on plant computers. Technical documents on design and construction of process equipment provide information about materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating, etc. This information is used as a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, and to evaluate proposed process and facility changes to ensure that process safety features are not compromised.  \n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS:\n\nSeadrift Coke, LP is committed to an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of materials.

From these investigations remedial actions are developed.  The OMS Program Steering Committee reviews the remedial actions and the approved list of remedial actions is entered into a computer-based remedial action tracking system.  All approved remedial actions are followed up to completion, before the Accident/Incident Report is closed.   These incident reports are kept on file in the computer for at least 5 years.  The reports are available to all employees on the computer.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo ensure that accident prevention program continues to be effective, a team of plant personnel conducts a quarterly evaluation on all Accident/Incident Reports entered during the previous quarter.  These evaluation reports are sent to the OMS Program Steering Committee for review and discussion.  The audit team\u00c2\u00bfs effectiveness and the entire Accident/Incident Reporting Program are audited at least annually to verify compliance with the established program.
