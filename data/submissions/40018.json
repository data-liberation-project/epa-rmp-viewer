The facility.\n\nMontana Sulphur & Chemical Company (MSCC) is a small business that operates a gas sweetening plant, a Claus/SuperClaus\u00bf sulfur recovery plant, a sulfur solids and fertilizer plant, a sulfide chemicals production facility, and a product storage facilities in a heavy industrial area northeast of Billings, Montana.  \n\nA review of the existing processes at MSCC has identified hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as the only chemical above the threshold quantities listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 68 and, therefore, subject to a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  \n\n2.  Facility Policies.   \n\nMSCC is committed to maintaining a safe work environment and to being a conscientious industrial neighbor.  Over the past five years, safety and security measures have been improved with the addition new monitors and process controls, among other changes.  \n\nWhile H2S is a widespread, naturally occurring substance ordinarily present in the human body as a result of digestion, and widespread in the environment due to biologic and geothermal processes, it is toxic at elevated concentrations. H2S is a byproduct of petroleum and gas refining and has many uses. It is prudent to observe safety precautions in handling H2S to prevent unnecessary human exposure at harmful concentrations in order to reduce risk to health and safety of workers and to nearby members of the community. MSCC has been and is strongly committed to protecting the health and safety of employees and nearby members of the community from significant H2S exposure arising from its liquid hydrogen sulfide processing and storage. Safety at MSCC depends upon the manner in which H2S is handled as well as various safety devices incorporated into the design of the equipment. Furthermore, the training and experience received by MSCC employees adds to the inherent safety of the process. MSCC has handled compressed hydrogen sulfide daily in large quantities at the site since 1956. It has produced and sto"

      "SummaryText": "red purified hydrogen sulfide in above threshold quantities since 1967 northeast of Billings. No injury to nearby members of the public, evacuation, or damage to property in the nearby community has occurred from MSCC's production or storage near Billings of liquid hydrogen sulfide in above threshold quantities during that period.\n\n3  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nMSCC has taken necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out in the RMP regulations. The H2S process is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations which parallel the prevention program in the RMP requirements except for the need for an analysis of offsite impacts. MSCC has prepared a PSM plan for the H2S used on site; the plan is referenced in this RMP and addresses the Program 3 prevention program for H2S. During the period, among other improvements, site lighting was improved and the electrical system was augmented with improved emergency backup generator systems; additional monitoring, control and communication capability was installed; vessel integrity was tested and an additional automatic mitigation system was installed and made operational. Also, consistent with national goals on hazardous materials inventory reduction, the company has significantly reduced its maximum onsite inventory of hydrogen sulfide in the past five years.\n\n4  Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years, no accidental releases of hydrogen sulfide above Reportable Quantity (RQ) thresholds (100 pounds) to the environment occurred at the regulated process. Two recordable accidental releases of H2S from the regulated process resulted in minor injuries to a person on-site. Each of these accidents temporarily affected a single worker, was of short duration, and involved the release of one pound or less of H2S from a connection that the affected worker was assembling.  The affected employees quickly and completely recovered. Each event was investigated promp"

      "SummaryText": "tly, and changes were made involving revised operating procedures and revised training.  There were no known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage related to these accidents.  \n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nMSCC has a written emergency response plan to deal with the accidental releases of chemicals. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment information, mitigation, evacuation, and communication with the local fire department, local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and through the agencies, the public. MSCC has contributed, along with several industries and agencies, to the installation of the County emergency siren systems, which is used as part of the County's Shelter-in-Place program for hazardous material and other emergencies.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is inspected and serviced, as necessary. In addition, the plan is updated, as required, to reflect pertinent changes taking place within the H2S process that would require a modified emergency response. \n\nThe emergency contact given in Section 1.8 is only for emergency response to releases. For information on the RMP emergency response planning, alternate contacts are currently Larry Zink, Fred Bell, and Vern Luderman who may be reached by calling 406.252.9324 or by mail. \n\n6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMSCC maintains an ongoing safety program to minimize accidental releases of H2S. This program includes employee training, preventive maintenance, hotwork permitting, lockout tagout procedures, vessel entry procedures, respirator training, and safe handling/operational procedures of the H2S process. Safety is a major concern at MSCC, and improvements in safety continue to be implemented on an as needed basis and during regular safety program reviews."
