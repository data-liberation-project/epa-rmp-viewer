The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDynaChem Inc. is a chemical manufacturing plant supplying foundry chemicals and other resins. The DynaChem plant in Georgetown, Illinois is located in a rural, sparsely populated section of Vermilion County. The plant uses three listed toxic chemicals above threshold quantities. Epichlorohydrin is stored and used in the production of epoxy resins, formaldehyde solution is stored and used in the production of phenolic resins, and formaldehyde and ammonia solutions are used in the Coron (fertilizer) manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n2. The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\n\n\nDynaChem, Inc. management and our on-site work force are firmly committed to safety. Each level of management is directly responsible for the implementation of all DynaChem environmental, health, and safety policies including Process Safety Management (PSM) Programs and Risk Management Program (RMP) Plans, and is responsible for the safety of all DynaChem employees and contractors. An active safety management team comprised of members from all affected departments participate in process hazard analyses (PHAs), incident reviews, Management of Change (MOC) and Pre-startup reviews, and training. DynaChem, Inc. has a comprehensive job specific and safety training program. The Georgetown Fire Department serves as the company's first responders in case of any emergency beyond the control or expertise of DynaChem's personnel.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nDynaChem Inc. has safety, quality control, and risk management programs that assure effective operator training and mandate a preventive maintenance program. For the most recently updated PHA, DynaChem Inc. used the hazard and operability study (HAZOP)  technique for the three covered processes.\n\n\n\n4. The"

      "SummaryText": " Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, DynaChem has had no accidental releases of epichlorohydrin, formaldehyde solution, or ammonia solution. \n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAlarm systems and emergency response are directed at initial evacuation and re-entry with personal protective equipment and monitoring instrumentation. The facility maintains an onsite emergency response team, and emergency response is coordinated with the Georgetown Fire Department and the Vermilion County Emergency Planning Committee. A written Emergency Response Plan is provided to these emergency response organizations. Both emergency response and emergency medical procedures are documented and are reviewed during emergency response training. Contracted spill response units handle spills that exceed those associated with normal operations and maintenance activities. The facility is continually evaluating the hazards of its operations and integrates OSHA, EPA, and State of Illinois requirements for chemical manufacturing.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough its PSM and continuous improvement programs, DynaChem intends to incorporate the following changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\n?    Applying additional process piping labels; and\n\n?    Addressing and resolving recommendations from the most recent PHA.\n\n"
