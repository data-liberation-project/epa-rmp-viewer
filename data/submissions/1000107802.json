      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. SUMMARY OF OPERATION WHICH REQUIRES RMP\n\nTri-Con Industries LTD. Manufacturing Plant is a recreational vehicle seat manufacturer.  The scope of business includes injection molding, polyurethane foam production, vacuum forming, sewing and assembly.  \n\nAt the foam production department, we use Lupranate TM30 which contains 50% - 75% of 2,4-Toluene Diisocyanates holding in the tank.  Each time, truck delivery the mixture at maximum of 43000 lbs. \n\nBecause we have more than minimum threshold for regulated substances, and 2,4-Toluene Diisocyanates , Tri-Con Industries LTD Manufacturing Plant is required to develop Risk Management Program.  Based on the modeling done with RMP COMP and other factors, Tri-Con Manufacturing Plant is a Level 2 program for this chemical.  \n\nToluene-diisocyanate is contained in the holding tank which is plumbed to the 55-gallon day tank for temperature control.  A piping system connects the day tank to the foam head on the robot. The foam head on the robot is the point at which the catalyst and the polyol are mixed together and shot into a mold.  The chemicals are periodically delivered by our supplier, Mitsui Chemicals America, Inc, via a tank truck.  The maximum capacity of the delivery is of approximately 43000 pounds of chemical (since it has 50% - 75 % of 2,4 Toluene-diisocyanate, so maximum is 32250 lbs. of 2,4 Toluene-Diisocyanates.  \n\n2. TRI-CON'S APPROACH TO CHEMICAL SAFETY\nTri-Con's management is committed to minimize negative impact to the environment.  As one way to ensure proper handling of chemicals on site, Tri-Con registered in ISO 14001.  Through our ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, we achieve continual improvement by means of internal audits, corrective actions and management reviews.  Training is also an important part of ISO 14001.  \n\nWork instructions are developed and implemented for key processes.  Deviations from the procedures and/or work instructions are pointed out by internal audits, a"

THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO:\nThe worst case scenario for our situation would be a total release of TDI mixture from the 43000 lbs holding tank.  There are several possibilities which will allow this to happen; however, we based our calculations on the following scenario: the valve that is located at the bottom of the tank would rupture or catastrophically fail allowing the whole content to spill from the tank.  The  of the possible rupture and the duration of the spill are described in the report.  The holding tank is located in a dike area that would hold the whole content of the tank.  The modeling of dispersion was done using RMP COMP which was downloaded from the EPA website and verified by CD distribution from EPA. The storage tank/diked area which will hold the whole content of the tank is enclosed by the building, thus reducing the chance of release outside of the facility.\n\nOTHER  ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:\nThe alternative and most likely scenario is that the pipe which connects the day tank and the foam mix head would rupture and spill the contents of the pipe system.  The duration of the spill is described in the report.  If this type of spill occurs, as soon as system becomes unbalanced, the pressure alarm will be sounded and the associate will manually shut down the system.  \nThe spill would happen in the foam production area where there is no mitigation system but enclosure.  The modeling was done using the RMP COMP which was downloaded from the EPA web site.\n\n4."

      "SummaryText": "THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs previously mentioned, Tri-Con Industries LTD has a commitment to reduce negative environmental impacts.  The tool that we use is ISO 14001 Environmental Management System. The ISO 14001 Manual includes Procedures and Work Instructions, including process control, Preventive Maintenance and emergency response procedures.  Our ISO 14001 Environmental Management System requires Tri-Con Industries, Ltd. to achieve continual improvement by utilizing internal audit, corrective action and management review.  Internal audits identify any deviation from the preventive maintenance program and emergency response procedures.  When a non-conformance to ISO 14001 Procedures is found, corrective actions are generated, resolving the root causes which allow deviations to take place.  Management periodically reviews the results of internal audits and the Manual/Procedures/Work Instructions to improve on the system itself.  General chemical safety for the process that applies to RMP is a part of this ISO 14001 system.    \n\nThere is Preventive Maintenance Checklist that also there is Daily Start Up checklist \n\n5. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have not had any accident resulted in deaths, injuries (OHSA Recordable), or significant property damage involving the covered process in the last five years. \n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response program is set up for fire, tornado and chemical spill.  There is Emergency Response Procedure and also the Event of TDI spill procedure.   In the event of chemical spill of , we will evacuate the plant.  The initial response will be done by City of Lincoln Fire Department Hazardous Material team.  The clean up will be contracted out to firms that specialize in hazardous material clean up.  We plan to conduct a drill at lease once a year.\nAlso in the case of chemical spill, we can call Haz-mat REsponse Inc at 911.\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO"
