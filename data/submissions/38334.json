Upon request of the local emergency planning committee or emergency response officials, promptly provide to the local emergency response officials the information necessary for developing and implementing the community emergency response plan.\n\u00b7 Training with local emergency response agencies and local emergency care providers.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release program. The PHA was conducted on May 27, 2004 under the RMP and CalARP program requirements. Based on these reviews, five action items were identified to improve the safety of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system. It is expected that the recommended actions be evaluated and implemented by December 2004. The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the covered processes."

The training program includes initial training, refresher training, and training documentation.\nEmployees currently involved in operating a regulated process and employees being transferred into a regulated process will be trained in an overview of the process and in the standard operating procedures. This initial training will also include emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.\nRefresher training will be provided a minimum of once every three years to employees involved in operating a regulated process to assure that the employee understands and adheres to the current standard operating procedures of the process.\nWe will verify that each employee involved in operating a regulated process has received and understood the required training. A record will be prepared that contains the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\nThe training programs and documentation are available in the RMP Central files.

They are transported on roads, water, and railways. We at Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District (FSSD) and our Contract Operator (the primary contractor responsible for all plant maintenance and operations in the facility) use chemicals, too. For example, we use chlorine and sulfur dioxide to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for landscaping or irrigation uses. Storing large qualities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine and sulfur dioxide very seriously. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency. Please feel free to contact Alex Williams at (707) 429-3233 or Larry Bahr at (707) 429-8930 if you have any questions.\n\nFSSD and the Contract Operator's basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety extends to the processes covered by the new EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements. We have developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nWe plan to meet or exceed regulatory requirements. In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents. Chlorine"

The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the disinfection of wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment. To meet this requirement, we store chlorine in quantities up to 28 one-ton cylinders. Typically, three chlorine cylinders are connected to a common manifold and liquid is piped from the two cylinders through a chlorine gas evaporator, to the chlorinators and on to chlorine injectors where it is injected into plant process water.\nWe store sulfur dioxide in quantities up to 12 one-ton cylinders. Typically, two sulfur dioxide cylinders are manifolded and liquid is piped from the two cylinders through a sulfur dioxide gas evaporator, to the sulfunators and on to the injectors where sulfur dioxide is injected into plant process water.\n\n3.
