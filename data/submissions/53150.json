The RMP rule is divided into three programs, based on off-site chemical impacts of neighboring schools, residential areas, and other structures of public occupation.  Programs 1 and 2 apply to facilities that pose no or limited risk to the off-site receptors while Program 3 requires additional requirements to effectively monitor and create response controls.  Triggers for these programs exist based on risk, population density, SIC code, five-year accident history, PSM applicability, and if the facility exceeds threshold quantities of listed chemicals.  Facilities that maintain inventories of regulated chemicals in excess of threshold quantities, as defined in 40 CFR 68.130, are required to develop a Risk Management Plan and submit to the USEPA, as well as state and local agencies.\n\nKinder Morgan Delta Terminal Services operates a bulk liquid storage terminal in Harvey, Louisiana.

The drums are filled and sealed to be loaded onto van trailers for transport.  The amount of TDI stored in storage tanks and at other stationary sources in the facility exceeds the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe maximum quantity of TDI in the largest tank, 300-1, is 11,500,000 pounds.  The maximum is intended inventory is 21,300,000 lbs. \n\nModeling\n\nRMP*Comp\u00bf, a modeling program developed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), was utilized to perform the OCA calculations required under the RMP regulation.  The primary result is the calculation of a distance (in miles) to an endpoint for each release scenario.  The distance to an endpoint is the distance a fire or explosion, from the point of an accidental release, will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  Endpoints are defined in 40 CFR 68.22. \n\nA second aspect of the modeling is to determine if off-site receptors are located within the distance endpoint.  Landview 6, a mapping system that includes database extracts from the EPA, the Bureau of Census, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other federal agencies was utilized.  Additionally, USGS topographic maps were reviewed to identify potential environmental receptors as required in 40 CFR 68.33.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis\n\nRMP development requires the completion of a Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis.  In order to maintain consistency from facility to facility, 40 CFR Part 68.25 defines various parameters needed to conduct a worst-case release analysis.

The flexible transfer hose has a nominal inside diameter of 2-inches.  The rate of the transfer pump is 300 gallon/minute.  \n\nRMP*Comp\u00bf calculated the release rate of TDI through a 2-inch opening as 0.176 pounds/minute.  This scenario was modeled using a release duration of one (1) minute, based on an estimate to allow facility personnel to identify the failure and to implement actions to stop the release.  At this rate, 3,052 pounds of TDI would be released.  RMP*Comp\u00bf modeled the distance endpoint for the release of 3,052 pounds of TDI as 0.1-mile.  The hazard endpoint 0.1 does not extend offsite.  \n\nConclusion\n\nA worst-case release of 11,500,000 pounds of TDI from the facility may affect up to 365 persons within 0.3 miles from the tanks or dike.  A reasonable TDI alternative release scenario is the failure and/or release from hose connections and process valving at transfer points.  Under this scenario, 3,052 pounds of TDI would be released.
