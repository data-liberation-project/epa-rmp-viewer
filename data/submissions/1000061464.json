The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Hamilton are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Hamilton Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry and liquid fertilizer for direct application as a crop nutrient. This facility also handles grain, pesticides, feed, seed and farm supply. Anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks are filled in Gallatin, MO and stored at this facility for the farmers to pick up, and to be delivered.\n\n\n\nThere could be as many as 25 nurse tanks parked at the facility at any one time.  This facility does not transfer anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1999\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has;\n\n\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\n       Standard, 29"

Local emergency responders will be notified to control any\n\n           release.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. Currently the facility is evaluating the requirements of CGA 2.1, 2014 and Process Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and will make the required upgrades needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    12/12/16\n\n"
