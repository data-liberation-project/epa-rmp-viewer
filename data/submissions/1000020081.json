The Facility started up in 2004 and was purchased from Hawkeye Renewables, LLC by FHR in February 2011.  The Facility RMP was updated and resubmitted in October 2009 and January 2011.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nFHR is committed to worker and public safety.  FHR management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety is the number one consideration in the handling of regulated substances; our goal is to prevent accidental releases through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel.  The Facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices based on company and industry experience developed over the years.  FHR's practice is to implement the controls necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained plant personnel will respond to help control and contain the release within their training and qualifications.  The local Fire Department will be contacted for additional response. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The Facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the presence in excess of threshold quantities of Anhydrous Ammonia, which is used as a pH buffer to the mash at the slurry tank  and Denaturant (natural gasoline), which is considered a flammable mixture, is used to make the ethanol an undrinkable mixture.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nFHR is subject"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Facility regularly conducts audits of the provisions of RMP and PSM to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standards are adequate and are being followed.  A compliance audit of each program is conducted every three years.  The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Facility management for resolution.  Findings and corrective actions taken in response to each finding are tracked until completion.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Facility include hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The PSM Program elements summarized previously apply to the Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant processes.  Collectively, these program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.  In addition to PSM, the Facility has instrumentation and equipment to detect, contain, and reduce the consequences of a release, including:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection \r\n-\tRoutine operator rounds\r\n-\tDaily Environmental checklist\r\n-\t24-hour Site Security\r\n-\tAmmonia detectors with alarms\r\n-\tMonitoring equipment to detect density, temperature, level, and pressure changes\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control \r\n-\tAtmospheric relief devices\r\n-\tValves to permit isolation of the process\r\n-\tAutomated shutdown systems\r\n-\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e., uninterruptible power supply for the process control system)\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation \r\n-\tContainment to contain liquid releases\r\n-\tFire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n-\tTrained emergency response personnel\r\n-\tEmergency response equipment located on-site\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR AC"

The Facility has developed an employee participation program as part of the PSM program.  Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\r\nThe PHA was last updated in October 2009.  The PHA is revalidated at least every five years.  The controlled copy of the PHA is maintained at the Facility and details the study methodology used, items reviewed (hazards of the process, facility siting, etc.), study team composition requirements, and the system used to address study findings and recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe Facility maintains documents describing process safety information (PSI), including material safety data sheets.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Training\r\nFacility Management is responsible for developing and implementing written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the PSI.  The operating procedures that have been developed have been prepared as a guide for those involved with initial start-up, normal operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown of the process.

After the contractor has been selected, the FHR representative conducts a contractor orientation meeting with the contract employer representative.  At that time, FHR reviews known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards that are related to the contractor's work and the covered process.  The contract employer representative is also informed of the applicable provisions of the emergency action plan, conditions regarding entrance to the process and the applicable safe work practices that must be followed in order to work at the site.  Because contractors may work on or near the process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, and are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\nAs part of the MOC process, whenever a modification to the existing chemical process is planned, either temporary or permanent, a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is required.  The PSSR confirms that, prior to putting into service, the construction and equipment being used is in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate training for each involved employee has been completed.  A PSSR includes field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nA mechanical integrity program has been developed as part of PSM that defines requirements for ensuring the integrity of process equipment.

A permit is required in process areas for cutting, welding, spark-producing equipment, etc., except in designated areas.  The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Facility has a Management of Change (MOC) program that reviews proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.

The programs consist of procedures for responding to releases, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address emergency response (including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures), evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, FHR has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions on the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training on performing their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or emergency response procedures.  \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSafety practices are continually reviewed.  Equipment and maintenance programs are monitored on an ongoing basis.  No immediate changes are scheduled at this time."
