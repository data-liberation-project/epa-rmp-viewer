Implementation of this policy shall be through the elimination of accidents and by establishing through our activities, safety and health management among the highest corporate priorities.  This policy applies to all employees and contractors at PolyOne Corporation.\n\nEnsuring the safety of all personnel is everyone's concern and requires a constant sense of awareness and attention to detail.  The development of safety awareness can only come through each person's acceptance of his responsibility for safety in conjunction with adequate job orientation, training, recognition and communication of the hazards associated with each work situation.  Everyone must believe that all accidents are either preventable or avoidable.\n\nEffective management of our process safety is critical in maintaining the integrity of our operations.  All necessary equipment, tools, technologies, procedures, and training will be provided to assist everyone in operating our processes and performing their jobs safely.  At PolyOne every job and operation must be managed safely.\n\nSafety performance will be a key element of each employee and contractor's performance evaluation.  Excellence in safety performance is a condition of employment at PolyOne.\n\nThe prevention of accidents while off the job is equally important.

It is assumed that the entire contents of the sphere are released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the release quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nUsing the equations for calculating over pressure from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAG).  \n? The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure equals 0.76 miles. \n\nUsing Fire Radiation Table 22, page 70 of OCAG.\n? The distance for radiant heat dose of 5 kW/square meter is 0.85 miles.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn overpressurization of a tank rupture disk or relief valve results in a release of 12,000 pounds of vinyl chloride.  The entire contents of the tank are released over 2 minutes.  Unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit (LFL).\n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the LFL for the alternative scenario is less than 317 feet or 0.06 miles.\n\nUsing Exhibit C-2, page 100 of OCAG.\n? LFL of VCM is 92 mg/l\n\nUsing Reference Table 21, page 66 of OCAG.\n? Distance to LFL for 6,000 pound/minute release rate is <0.06 miles (<317 feet)\n\n\n PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nPolyOne Corporation has in place a prevention program encompassing elements consistent"
