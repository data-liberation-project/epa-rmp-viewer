As a municipal agency, plant personnel work closely with appropriate agencies in the City of Bethlehem to assure safe operation of the plant, and expedient response in case of an emergency.\n\nDescription of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Bethlehem operates a water treatment plant located in Northampton County, Pennsylvania.  The toxic substance maintained as a part of the City of Bethlehem's Water Treatment Plant operations is chlorine.  It can be used for pre-chlorination and/or post chlorination.  The facilities include a Chlorine Storage Room, Chlorine Feed/Control Room and a Chlorine Scrubber Room.  The Chlorine Storage Room provides an area to store up to twenty (20) one-ton cylinders.  Under normal operating conditions the facility stores twelve (12) one-ton cylinders in the Chlorine Storage Room.\n\nA maximum of eight (8) one ton cylinders could be manifolded to the chlorine supply at one time.  There are four (4) cylinder scales used to keep track of inventory by weight loss (each shared by a pair of containers).  The cylinders are connected to the manifold header by means of a valve and yoke assembly along with a flexible connector.  Under normal operating conditions, six (6) cylinders are connected to the system.  The remaining six cylinders are stored unconnected in the Chlorine Storage Room. \n\nGaseous chlorine, which is under the pressure in the ton cylinder, flows to vacuum regulator check units located on each cylinder.  From the vacuum regulator check units, chlorine flows under vacuum conditions by means of a remote eductor that uses the flow of motive water to produce a vacuum.  A loss of vacuum will automatically close the va"

      "SummaryText": "cuum regulator check units on each cylinder.  The vacuum regulator check units supply chlorine to the automatic remote vacuum switchover unit.  The throttling action of the gas check valve reduces the varying chlorine supply pressure to a constantly regulated vacuum.  A pressure relief valve is located on each switchover device.  If pressure were to develop, a pressure relief valve would open to release gas to the atmosphere.  The automatic remote switchover unit provides continuous chlorine feed by automatically switching to the alternative chlorine supply when the supply in service is exhausted.  There are four cabinet mounted chlorinators located in the Chlorine Feed/Control Room to meter the chlorine flow.  Two chlorinators are dedicated for pre chlorination (one operational and one spare) and two chlorinators dedicated for post chlorination (one operational and one spare).\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility approaches release prevention by assuring that its containers, feed lines, valves and other mechanical apparatus in the chlorine supply system adhere to applicable ASTM and ANSI standards, as well as providing training to its employees which allows them to safely and efficiently carry out their duties.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases during the five year period from June 2004 through June 2009.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThere are three chlorine gas detectors, one located in each room.  These detectors continuously monitor for chlorine in these three locations.  A chlorine level warning will sound at 1 ppm and a chlorine alarm will sound at 3 ppm.  If there is a leak of chlorine detected in the Chlorine Storage Room above 3 ppm of chlorine, the chlorine scrubber system will be activated.  When this system is activated the ventilation system will shut down and the air will be drawn out through the scrubber.  The scrubber utilizes sodium hydroxide to react with the chlorine, r"

The scrubber system can also be activated manually by activating one of the scrubber activate buttons located in the Chlorine Storage Room or on the loading dock. \n\nBecause the facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC 1103, it is exempted from compliance with the emergency response program requirements at 40 CFR 68.95.  Instead, in the event of a release, the Site Emergency Coordinator (SEC) on duty will be notified.  Facility personnel will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  Instead, the personnel on duty will activate the chlorine scrubber and notify other personnel at the WTP.  If a release is not contained within the facility, the SEC on duty will immediately notify the Northampton County Emergency Management Agency and the local Lehigh Township Fire Department.  The fire official will act as the incident commander coordinator, and will assume responsibility for monitoring the release, assessing the impact on the area, and keeping a detailed log of all activities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are no physical changes planned to improve safety.  All recommended changes identified during the hazard review portion of the RMP have been implemented.  "
