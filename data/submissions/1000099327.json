      "SummaryText": "o involves a release of all in process quantities of gas to be released in a ten minute time span.  It will be further assumed that all active process equipment would fail in this scenario.  This event would release approximately 8,000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas from the 4 manifold cylinders that were online assuming they were full.  Based on tables supplied by USEPA, the affected area would encompass approximately a 2.7 mile radius around the facility.  The affected population would be approximately 50,000 people based on the 2010 census. This would also include several schools, nursing homes, shopping areas, and two local hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe selected worst case scenario involves chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas being released through a one quarter inch hole in a single one ton cylinder.  Such a release would occur with the loss of a fusible plug due to excessive heat, which would cause a pressure increase in the cylinder.  The fusible plug is designed to release chlorine gas in a controlled way when extremely high temperatures cause excessively high pressure in a tank.   The plug would then give way, avoiding a catastrophic release.  Based on the USEPA table, the effected release radius would be approximately 0.1 miles.  Increasing the diameter of the hole, simulating the breakage of a discharge valve would increase the radius potential to 0.2 miles.  This scenario would have a potential off site impact on 29 nearby residence with approximately 120 occupants.  It should be noted that the 29 homes within the 0.2 radius are located at a significantly higher elevation than the chlorine storage.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and would collect in the low areas.  All homes are located to the east and northeast of the facility.  If the wind direction is not from the south or southwest the residential area could experience little or no impact from a release. Consideration must be noted that the temperature and pressure changes will affect the release rate."

      "SummaryText": "As the gas leaks, the evaporation will cause the liquid to cool, reducing gas pressure.  The reduction of both temperature and pressure will cause a decrease in the release rate.\r\n\r\nThere have been no chlorine gas releases during the past five (5) year period.  The KRMA Facility also has a very good safety record with regards to lost time accident. \r\n\r\nThe Contingency Plan for a chlorine emergency involves contacting both the fire and police departments of the City of Kankakee, and the Village of Bradley.  Also, notifying and accounting for all facility personnel, and evacuating the plant if necessary.  The local fire departments and hazmat units will resolve the chlorine emergency.  These special units are trained, and are proficient in the use of the B Repair Kit for one ton chlorine cylinder leaks.  Both the Kankakee and Bradley Police Departments will respond to any off site emergency, and will assist in any public notification and evacuation if necessary."

      "SummaryText": "The Kankakee River Metropolitan Agency (KRMA) Wastewater Treatment Facility services the metropolitan areas of the City of Kankakee, the Village of Bradley, the Village of Bourbonnais, and the Village of Aroma Park.  The primary responsibility of KRMA is to provide wastewater treatment to the Kankakee River Valley in accordance with state and federal regulations.  \r\n\r\nThe treatment process, which is a biological nutrient removal (BNR) sludge system, includes screening, grit removal, primary clarification, anaerobic digestion, sludge disposal (land application), anoxic zone aeration, secondary clarification, disinfection (chlorine gas), and de-chlorination (sulfur dioxide).  The chlorine facility stores up to twelve (12) 1- ton chlorine cylinders and twelve (12) 1-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide during the chlorination season (May 1st thru October 31st).  Eight (8) cylinders are manifold on a pressure feed system (4 feeding, 4 on standby), and the other 4 are available to swap out the empties. The chlorine/sulfur dioxide facility is equipped with chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak sensors connected to audible, visual and pager alarms.     \r\n\r\nKRMA has increased safety of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide facility by housing all equipment in a concrete block building, which includes Purafil Emergency Gas Scrubbers. The gas scrubbers have chlorosorb media that removes contaminant gases by means of adsorption, absorption and chemical reaction of any chlorine gas releases.  Standard operating procedures call for 8 cylinders to be manifold at all times, with 4 online and 4 in the standby mode for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine is fed by use of an automatic switchover system.  The chlorine feed rate is controlled by SCADA to maintain a set point.  The automatic switchover system allow one bank of cylinders to switch to another depending on pressure. The system function is accomplished with an internal programmable logic controller.  If needed, local manual override is convenie"

      "SummaryText": "ntly available for operator control to maintain continuous operation. There are safety features unique to the automatic switchover system; these features reduce or eliminate the probability of operational problems occurring, and give the highest levels of safety for personnel and plant. The sulfur dioxide feed system is controlled by dual automatic change-over vacuum regulator for automatic control. Each vacuum regulator is equipped with a vacuum actuated, manually reset, three position, status lever marked reserve, operating, and empty. When the operating tanks are exhausted, its status lever moves to empty and the reserve tanks status lever moves to the operating position. This provides an automatic changeover of gas feed from the exhausted to the full gas supply container.  \r\n\r\nThe systems are also protected by a Halogen Valve System. During an emergency the actuator will close the ton container valve when triggered by a gas leak detector, remote switch, or any combination of automatic or manual switches.  The Halogen Valve System is used for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The Halogen Valve System has been approved for chlorine service by The Chlorine Institute.  \r\n\r\nThe cylinders are delivered by flat bed truck and are unloaded by an electric hoist system.  After full cylinders are positioned, the empties are loaded on the truck and taken from the site.  The cylinders operating valves are protected by steel dome covers which are removed only when cylinders are put online.  The contracted chemical supplier is responsible for the safe delivery, transportation, and integrity of all cylinders.  They are also required annually, prior to chlorination season, to conduct chlorine safety training with a trainer certified by The Chlorine Institute, demonstrating the proper use of the B Kit for the KRMA staff.   \r\n\r\nThe 112&reg; requires that the Risk Management Plan contain both a Worst Case Scenario, and an Alternate Case Scenario.
