We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP regulation\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA RMP rule\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nOur facility produces a number of products that include propylene oxide (P0), tertiary butyl alcohol, propylene glycols, propylene glycol ethers, and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. These units/processes use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nTOXICS\nPropylene Oxide (P0): Approximately 35.4 million lbs are produced, stored and used on-site. P0 is the major product of the facility and is also a feed stock for the propylene gylcols and propylene gylcol ethers.\n\nFLAMMABLES\nPropylene: Approximately 1,800,000 lbs are stored and used on-site. Propylene is a primary feed stock for the three P0 Units.\nPropane: Approximately 325,000 lbs ar"

Isobutane is a primary feed stock for the three P0 Units.\nIsobutylene: Approximately 4,000,000 lbs are stored and used on-site. Isobutylene is a product of the facility.\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\nEPA\u00bfs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility. The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nREGULATED TOXIC CHEMICALS\nWorst-case Scenario - Propylene Oxide\nThe worst case scenario for propylene oxide (P0) assumes the complete rupture of the largest P0 storage tank releasing 13,400,000 pounds of liquid P0 into a containment dike, leading to a vapor cloud release. This release would impact off-site public receptors.\nCredit was taken for the containment dike (passive mitigation). The entire contents of the tank were contained, reducing the amount of P0 released to the atmosphere.\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propylene Oxide\nThe alternative release scenario for propylene oxide assumes failure of a 6\u00bf loading hose or loading arm. This release scenario also assumes the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and all active safety systems fail including the emergency shutdown. The total release would be 20,700 pounds of P0, the vapor cloud would extend past the fence line and impact adjacent industrial sites.\nCredit was not taken for safety systems in place that would minimize the release. These systems include:\n- Emergency shutdown switch"

The overpressure would extend past the fence line and impact industrial and residential neighbors.\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propylene\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables assumes a flange separation on an 8\u00bf propylene recycle line. This release scenario also assumes the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and all active safety systems fail. The total release would be approximately 163,000 pounds of propylene, leading to a vapor cloud explosion and overpressure. The overpressure would extend slightly past the fence line and could impact the nearest industrial facility at the fence line.\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis: A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or change to existing processes at the design stage to identify and mitigate potential safety, health, and environmental issues before the process is installed and operated.

Operating procedures are based on process hazard/risk reviews. The procedures include emergency shutdown and safe start-up methods.\nOperator Training/Certification Program: The plant has a training and testing program which provides operators with the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process. Operator recertification is required.\nMaintenance Procedures: The plant has specific procedures for maintaining process equipment so that it operates safely. Plant and unit specific procedures for servicing operating equipment are in place, including preventative maintenance and reliability programs.\nMaintenance Training: The plant trains and tests mechanics and craftsmen who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipment and inspections on operating equipment to ensure they have the required knowledge and skills.\nMechanical Integrity Program: Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are periodically tested and inspected to ensure safe operation of process equipment, following recognized standards and/or government requirements.
