This facility conforms with the laws and regulations of the state of Missouri.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has four anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  Two tanks have 18,000 gallons water capacity each and two tanks have 12,000 gallon water capacity each.  The four storage tanks, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks and applicators, risers for filling nurse tanks, electric panels, lighting and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  Though the facility is manned throughout the year, anhydrous ammonia is sold to farmers only during the spring and fall use seasons.  This facility operates with normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes two ammonia release scenarios, identified as \" Worst Case Scenario \" release and \" Alternative \" release scenarios.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \" Worst Case \" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure to the largest storage tank releasing the entire 85000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes.

      "SummaryText": "ff-site consequences were calculated using TFI's DEGADIS Model.  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \" F \" atmospheric stability class.  A rural topography was selected as typical.  The distance to endpoint was 0.9 miles.  It is estimated that 4300 citizens would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \" Alternative \" release scenario assumes a hose breaks during transfer and releases 7200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3 meters per second with a \" D \" atmospheric stability class was used for this scenario.  Using urban topography, because the release would be confined to the area within the city, with TFI's DEGADIS Model, the toxic endpoint is 0.46 miles.  The population within that area is estimated to be 3900 citizens.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because the equipment, excess flow valves devices and human intervention will stop the release.\n\n\nLincoln County Farmers Cooperative has had no significant accidental release of anhydrous ammonia within the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or property damage at the facility, nor, to our knowledge has there been any significant accidental release resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.  Even though the company has had no release it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nLincoln County Farmers Cooperative is in compliance with the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61 \", published by the American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia \".

The company has also provided state and local authorities with the Emergency Action Plan and Community Right to Know information as required under SARA Tittle lll  ( EPCRA ).\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  Changes are made when necessary or when required by regulation changes.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this facility at this time."
