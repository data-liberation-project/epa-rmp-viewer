This policy is to be enforced through strict compliance with applicable regulations, physical safeguards, rigorous training, and deployment of adequate resources.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response are given the highest priority.\n\nThe Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to formulate regulations for managing and reducing the probability of release of highly hazardous chemicals.  On June 20, 1996, EPA promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) requiring any stationary source utilizing greater than a specified threshold quantity of a regulated substance to develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) to regulatory authorities on or before June 21, 1999.  Regulated substances include 77 air toxics and 63 flammable gases or liquids.\n\nMCAS Cherry Point has one process subject to EPA RMP regulations:\n\n\u00b7Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the water treatment plant (WTP)\n\nChlorine is used in excess of their threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton containers and used in the treatment of drinking water at the WTP.  \n\nThis RMPlan summarizes the primary components of the RMP in place at MCAS Cherry Point to correspond with specific EPA RMP requirements, including:\n\n\u00b7Management \u00bf A separate document, the \u00bfCompliance Management Plan for Clean Air Act Section 112(r) Risk Management Program\u00bf details specific requirements for a management system under 40 CFR 68.15.\n\u00b7Hazard Assessment \u00bf The Hazard Assessment assessed a WCS and ARS with the only active mitigation being excess flow values.  Thus a true worst-case scenario was represented.  Additionally, there have been no chlorine accidents at the WTP since it was built ov"

The Fire Department is the first responder in the event of a release \u00bf WTP employees do not respond to chlorine releases.  The ERP also includes communication with regulatory and other response agencies as well as first aid information.\n\n\u00b7Planned Changes to Improve Safety \u00bf Resulting from Cherry Point\u00bfs most recent PHA (conducted 8/15/2002), the WTP plans to investigate many options to improve safety, including posting an SOP for inspection of delivery truck and providing a chlorine alarm downhill from the chlorinator room.\n\n\u00b7Certification; and\n\n\u00b7Registration and RMP*Submit data elements."
