This plan complies with the policy of providing a safe work environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors.  It extends to the design, training and implementation of a comprehensive emergency management program that saves lives and reduces property damage in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nPrevention is the primary goal.  However if an emergency should ever occur, the immediate goal is to contain the emergency and its effects within facility boundaries, mitigate the incident as quickly as possible and prevent any threat to the general public and neighbors.  It is EOTT Energy Liquids policy to operate in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with environmental knowledge, policy and regulation that best serves the needs of the employees, community and the company.  Life preservation is the prime consideration, so all procedures will be carried out in a manner to minimize risk to employees and emergency response personnel.  Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions. \n\n\nThe EOTT Energy Liquids facility stores Ethane, Butylene, Butane, Iso-butane, Natural Gasoline and mixed hydrocarbons in underground storage wells.  \n\nThis facility has no substantial amount of any toxic materials that are covered by this regulation. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nA worst case scenario is designed to be a theoretical exercise which calculates the potential impact on the community based upon extreme conditions prescribed by the EPA.  The worst-case scenario involving a flammable stored in a salt dome is a 10-minute release through the largest diameter of the wellhead, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  Weather conditions are assumed to be the least favorable possible, existing s"

      "SummaryText": "afety systems and procedures can not be considered, and trained emergency personnel are assumed to stand idly by.  These assumptions make the worst-case scenario highly unlikely.  The \"endpoint\" for an explosion is defined by the EPA as the point where overpressure has decreased to one pound per square inch.  At a one pound overpressure, you could experience being knocked down to the ground if caught outside.  Buildings could experience some minor damage such as broken windows.  Persons and buildings inside this \"endpoint\" distance would experience greater effects.  The worst case scenario for this facility involves the shearing of a 20\" wellhead resulting in a 10-minute release of butane.  The butane vapor is assumed to form a vapor cloud, which then explodes.  The explosion would cause a one pound overpressure extending to offsite areas.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nScenarios that are more realistic or alternative release scenarios were also developed to better model a real world event.  The alternative release scenarios allow a facility's safety systems to work and apply typical weather conditions.  These scenarios may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.  The alternative release scenario for EOTT Energy Liquids is a 10-minute release of iso-Butane from a 1\" pipe rupture followed by a flash fire.  The end point distance for a flash fire is defined as the point where the concentration of flammable material in the air is low enough not to ignite.  In this case, the endpoint distance  extends to offsite areas.\n\n\nEOTT Energy Liquids follows Department of Transportation and Texas Railroad Commission regulations that are appropriate to pipelines and underground storage facilities.  These regulations include DOT 195, Railroad Commission of Texas Statewide Rules and Railroad Commission of Texas Barbers Hill Special Field Rules.  In addition, EOTT Energy Liquids follows other health, safety and environmental regulations appropriat"

      "SummaryText": "e to a chemical storage facility.  By Corporate policy, we operate safely and with concern for the environment.  We take this responsibility seriously.  The plant is designed following recognized design practices and procedures.  Detailed operating procedures and training assure that the facility will be operated safely during normal and emergency situations.  A sophisticated control system monitors the operation of the plant and if necessary an emergency shut down system will accomplish a safe and orderly shut down.  EOTT Energy Liquids has conducted process hazard analyses to determine the risks that exist in our process and opportunities to reduce those risks.  EOTT Energy Liquids uses modern maintenance practices, tools and systems to keep equipment operating reliably and detect repair needs in their early stages.  To improve equipment reliability, EOTT Energy Liquids conducts mechanical integrity inspections and failure analysis to determine the root cause of failures.  Qualified personnel who have been trained in plant maintenance procedures maintain the plant.
