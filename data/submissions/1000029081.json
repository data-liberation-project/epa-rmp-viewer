This Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR 68.155.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Oklahoma City Utilities Department implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including inspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide immediate corrective response to any accidents.\n\nThe Lake Draper WTP staff are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response to accidental releases is also coordinated with the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Lake Draper WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the drinking water treatment process.\n\nChemical Name\n\nStationary Source\n\nMaximum Inventory\n\nChlorine\n\n2, 30-ton storage tanks\n\n120,000 pounds\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\n8,000 gallons (2, 4,000 gallon tanks)\n\n41,200 pounds\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazar"
