The faclity is located on the Stockton West, California U.S.G.S. 7.5 minut Quadrangle map.\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is delivered by truck to the facility, and is stored in a 15,000 gallon tank to the west of the turbine-generator, on the west side of the site located on the south side of W. Washington St.,  from which it is vaporized and distributed to each of the two fluid bed boilers in order to remove NOx (oxides of nitrogen) in the exhaust gas stream.  Storage Pressure is 90-140 psig, and Storage Temperature is ambient."
