The Niklor Chemical Company (Niklor) Carson Facility also uses chlorine as part of its product manufacturing process.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The Niklor facility takes all possible safety measures to prevent the accidental release of chlorine as well as mitigating the impacts of any chlorine release to the atmosphere.  Niklor facility has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\nThe Niklor facility chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n7 General facility and regulated substances information.\n7 Offsite consequence analysis results.\n7 Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n7 Five-year accident history summary.\n7 Emergency response program summary.\n7 Planned changes to improve safety.\nThe above information for the Niklor facility Chlorination System is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Niklor facility accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management practices.

Niklor has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for handling chlorine to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Los Angeles County Fire Department). Niklor facility has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Niklor facility is located at 2060 East 220th Street in Carson, California.  The Facility is situated north of Interstate Highway 405, and approximately 2 miles west of Interstate Highway 710, between Wilmington Avenue and Alameda Street.  The facility covers an area of approximately 1.5 acres.  The facility currently stores and uses anhydrous chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  The Niklor facility has two basic product lines, both of which utilize chloropicrin manufactured form the chlorine. The first line produces Chloropicrin (PIC) for shipment to distributors, while the second product line produces PIC/methyl bromide mixtures for use as a soil and structural fumigant. Anhydrous chlorine used as part of the process is received at the Facility in 90-ton rail tank cars.  One chlorine rail car is unloaded at a time at only one location at the Facility.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at Niklor facility at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and Ca"

A chlorine leak sensor is also provided in the chlorine processing area.  In case of a major chlorine leak, the chlorine rail car can be isolated by the emergency shutoff valve located on the piping downstream of the rail car manway.  There are emergency shutdown switches located near the rail car, in the chlorine processing area and in the main office control room. The alarms are annunciated at the main office as well as throughout the facility.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to terminate the chlorine leak. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided in the chlorine unloading area, in the chlorine process area and in the adjacent PIC manufacturing building.\n\nAccess to the facility is restricted by a gated chain link fence that is six feet and/or 12 feet in height.  An alarm system is used to protect the office.  At night the area is locked and the buildings are lighted externally.  A patrol service checks on the facility during nighttime hours.  When railcar shipments are made at night an operator remains at the plant until the shipment is complete.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the "

The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (77 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected involves the release of chlorine from the monel flexible hose connecting the railcar to the chlorine process.  This scenario can occur if the operator uses a flex hose, which is worn or has a defect and results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine from the railcar.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16 inch) diameter.

Toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3 ppm.  EPA suggested typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meter per second, average air temperature of 77 deg F, and average relative humidity of 50 percent.
