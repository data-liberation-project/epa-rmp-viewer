      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis is to inform all interested person, including employees, that Ralphs Grocery Company\u00bfs Riverside Facility, located at 1500 Eastridge Avenue, Riverside, California, has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 and California Title 19.\n\nI.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRalphs has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety by operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accident release prevention program and emergency planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect he environment.  These programs include OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (Process Safety Management or PSM) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP).  In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\nII.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nRalphs\u00bfs Riverside Facility operates both a distribution center and a manufacturing plant.  Accordingly, there are two separate and distinct refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  One system provides refrigerated warehousing of perishable foods and contains an ammonia charge of 49,534.  The other system provides refrigeration for manufactured fluid milk and other beverages and contains an ammonia charge of 14,830 pounds.\n\nIII.\tWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \u00bf Process 1 (Perishables Refrigeration)\n\nThe worst-case release scenario associated with the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at the facility would be a failure of the Perishable high suction accumulator.  Thirty-five thousand (35,000) pounds of ammonia would be instantaneously release, and it is assumed that the vessel would be emptied in ten minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the ammonia released is estimated to be 2.6 miles from the facility.  The"

      "SummaryText": "anhydrous ammonia would be release inside a building, which acts as a passive mitigation for the release.  According to analysis tools obtained from the US Census Bureau, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  A credit for an administrative control limiting the volume to eighty percent (80%) of capacity was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSpecific systems to prevent or mitigate this scenario include an ammonia gas detector and alarm systems, a sprinkler system, pressure relief systems, and security surveillance.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \u00bf Process 2 (Fluid Milk Manufacturing)\n\nThe worst-case release scenario associated with the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at the facility would be a failure of the Ice Builder Evaporator.  Four thousand seven hundred (4,700) pounds of ammonia would be instantaneously release, and it is assumed that the vessel would be emptied in ten minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the ammonia released is estimated to be 1.3 miles from the facility.  According to analysis tools obtained from the US Census Bureau, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u00bf Process 1 (Perishables Refrigeration)\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a leak in an ammonia loading hose.  This scenario leads to a release of 1,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in ten minutes.  Although active mitigation measures do exist, no active measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  According to analysis tools obtained from the US Census Bureau, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\n\nSpecific systems to prevent or mitigate this scenario include a manual emergency shutdown system, an ammonia gas detector and alarm systems, a sprinkler system, and security surveillance.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u00bf Process 2 (Fluid Milk Manufacturing)\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a leak in an ammonia"

Overall, the PSM/RMP prevents accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoids physical property damage.\n\nV.\tGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur RMP/PSM enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Overall, the PSM/RMP prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur RMP/PSM prevents accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern the individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to an accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nOur RMP/PSM contains the following elements:\n\n-\tProcess Safety Information\n-\tProcess hazard Analysis\n-\tStandard Operating Procedures\n-\tTraining\n-\tMechanical Integrity\n-\tManagement of Change\n-\tPre-Startup Safety Review\n-\tCompliance Audits\n-\tIncident Investigation\n-\tEmployee Participation\n-\tHot Work Permit\n-\tContractor Qualifications\n-\tEmergency Response\n\nVI.\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years there has been one (1) documented accidental release of ammonia from a covered process which resulted in on site injuries.  The release occurred on September 11, 1999, and it resulted in 7 minor to moderate onsite injuries.\n\nVII.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nOur facility has an in-house"

Training on emergency response procedure is provided to maintenance engineers upon hiring and refresher courses are provided annually.  In the event emergency health services are required, trained responders are equipped with basic first aid knowledge and will assist the Fire Department emergency medical personnel..\n\nThe emergency procedures provide directions for the facility occupants on proper notification of agencies, announcement of an emergency and evacuation of the buildings.\n\nVIII.\tPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe facility is designed and constructed in accordance with the appropriate building and safety codes as well as relevant fire codes.  Any improvements or requested changes to the facility have been addressed prior to startup and worker safety procedures are in place.  Currently, there are no planned changes to safety.\n\nThe Distribution Assistant Manager and Creamery Plant Engineer are the program coordinators with the overall responsibility to ensure that program goals and objectives are met and appropriate resources are available.  The Safety Manager serves as the program advisor and provides guidance and support to the program coordinators.  The program coordinators will review and update the PSM/RMP as necessary.  Copies of the written program may be reviewed by request to one of the coordinators."
