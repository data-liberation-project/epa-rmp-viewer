The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Magee Facility is coordinated with the Simpson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Mr. Glen Jennings is the contact for the LEPC (601/847-3434).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Magee Facility has around-the-clock communications capability.  Trinity River Energy Operating, LLC operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Trinity River Energy Operating, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Magee Facility for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Magee Facility inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe process of the compression and dehydration of natural gas and removal of condensate and natural gas liquids occurs in the following way.\r\n\r\nProduced natural gas is routed from the surrounding wells to the Magee Facility. Natural gas is routed to the compressor and then to the amine unit to remove CO2. The gas is then sent to the glycol dehydrator to remove entrained water. The gas is then sent to the JT unit prior to entering the sales pipeline. This unit is used for both dew point suppression and to recover NGL's without fractionation. Any liquids recovered by the JT unit are sent to the pressurized storage tank and then loaded onto pressurized tank trucks. Produced water is routed to the facility from the surrounding wells to one of the 500 barrel fixed roof atmospheric storage tanks. Any entrained oi"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nTrinity River Energy Operating, LLC used the Safety Analysis Checklist (SAC) technique to perform this evaluation. The analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Hazard Review team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Magee Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

Training of affected personnel helps ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nTrinity River Energy Operating, LLC promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard reviews and hazard review revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Trinity River Energy Operating, LLC periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted on a periodic basis.  Both hourly and staff personnel par"

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \r\n\r\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Magee Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Magee Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Magee Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1.\tTanks are gauged\r\n2.\tTanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\r\n3.\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1.\tBerms around tanks\r\n2.\tProcess relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere to prevent vessels from rupturing\r\n3.\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a vent header to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n4.\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\r\n5.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\r\n6.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation \r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1.\tTrained emergency response personnel\r\n2.\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\r\n3.\tSPCC Plan\r\n4.\tFire extinguis"
