Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nSparkle Pool Service (also \"SPS\") stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  SPS has Emergency Response Procedures at the site and in the office, which includes procedures for reporting any hazardous chemical accident or release and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  SPS also has Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures, which is a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as Emergency Escape Mask Procedures, which details how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of an accidental  release.  \n\n\n\nSPS's Emergency Action Plan is contained within Section N of its PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees have available safety goggles/glasses, gloves and escape masks.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A verbal notification system is in place to alert personnel about chlorine leaks.  A posted Emergency Telephone List identifies who to call in the event of a release, which includes calling 911.\n\n\n\n2.

The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools.  The facility operates five days a week (M-F), eight hours per day, approximately 33 weeks per year.\n\n\n\nThe Fill Yard is used for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \n\n\n\nThe Fill Yard houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the building.  Signs are posted indicating a restricted area.  Container handling and storage is per local, state and federal regulations.\n\n\n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months  are the busiest swim times of the year.  The quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. SPS stores a maximum of 10,300 pounds of chlorine.  This amount includes the contents of 3 one-ton containers, 111 twenty-pound cylinders, and the (1) one-ton container in the repackaging process.   The Federal threshold of 2,500 pounds is exceeded as the maximum on site at any given time is 10,300 pounds of chlorine.\n\n\n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The one-ton containers, up to a maximum of 4, are stored and/or used in the Fill Yard.\n\n\n\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist or a lift gate.  The one-ton containers are placed on a concrete slab in the Fill Yard.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location and chocked to prevent movement.

The company has administrative procedures in place that limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 4 one-ton containers and 111 each twenty pound cylinders for a total of 10,300 maximum pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 10,300 pounds.\n\n\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine is directed into a liquid caustic absorption tank.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in accordance with the maintenance procedures in the PSM.  \n\n\n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.  The major components of the chlorine system are:  the one-ton DOT aproved cylinders, the proprietary transfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity DOT approved cylinders, the scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine absorption system.\n\n\n\nA proprietary tube assembly is attached to the lower (liquid level) angle valve on the operating one-ton container and an empty service cylinder is brought into place on a scale and attached to the other end of the transfer assembly.  Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, the cylinder valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.  After filling, which is indicated by weight on the scale reaching the desired value, the cylinder valve is closed, the ton supply of chlorine is closed, and the transfer tubing is evacuated into the chlorine"

Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacutate the facility and await the arrival of local emergency responders at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  SPS's Emergency Response Plan is located in the office area as a quick reference for how to handle an emergency. \n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSPS's Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) was recently updated and some changes were recommended to be implemented on site by June 15, 2015.   Current applicable codes and regulations were reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process system."
