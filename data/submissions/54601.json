Among the processes required for proper treatment of potable water is the chlorination process.  The chlorination process adds chlorine gas to process water to reduce bacteria. Chlorine is received in ton containers. The chlorination process has a designated area for storage and process activities.  The process has been designed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes and requirements. The process has a gas detection system that alarms should the concentration of chlorine reach 1.0 parts per million. The chlorination process is maintained and operated by personnel certified by the State of Wisconsin as Surface Water Treatment Plant Operators.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: the facility maintains a compliance program to meet the requirements of WI. Comm 32.27 (OSHA's \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\") for the chlorination process.  Compliance with this regulation, and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps to prevent the release of chlorine from this process.  Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release. The facility continually reviews safety practices and procedures, resulting in improvements such as the recent installation automatic shut-off valves for the chlorination process that would be initiated through the chlorine detection system.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:There have been no accident or injuries related to the chlorination process during the previous five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM"

Input from these sources is addressed as quickly as possible."
