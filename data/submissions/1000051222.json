Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nTurk Power Plant complies with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. All employees\r\nare informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous\r\nsubstances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has\r\nprocedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a\r\nhazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and\r\nresponse procedures.\r\n\r\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nTurk Power Plant is located in Fulton, AR. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous\r\nammonia, is used in a supply system for emissions reduction. In order to protect its employees,\r\nthe public and the environment, Turk Power Plant has an integrated safety management program\r\nto prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific\r\nPrevention\r\n\r\nThe Turk Power Plant facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for\r\na release of ammonia from the storage system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any\r\nleak is easily detected. The tank area is provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if\r\nammonia is detected. The storage system is designed so that major components can be isolated\r\nby closing selected valves. Further, system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable\r\nin the safe operation of the storage system. In case of a release that could travel off the plant\r\nproperty, calls would be made to the Fire Department and the County Disaster Services\r\nCoordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n4. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Planning and Response\r\n\r\nThis facility has procedures in"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nTurk Power Plant expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of the\r\nPSM/RMP program. All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to\r\nimprove the safety performance of the ammonia storage process. Turk Power Plant expects to\r\nevaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those\r\nrecommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of\r\nan unintentional release."
