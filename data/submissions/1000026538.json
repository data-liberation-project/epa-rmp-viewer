Employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and in possible response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.  The plant has developed a Hazardous Materials Team made up of plant employees who are trained to respond in the event of an ammonia release on site.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nLand O' Frost is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore, under the EPA Risk Management Rule, the plant is a Program 3 facility with a Program 3 Prevention Program. The OSHA Process Safety Management /EPA Prevention Program consists of facility management policies and procedures which promotes and recognizes process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, and process hazardous chemical materials. The procedures address all aspects of plant activities including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, maintenance, safe work practices, incident investigation, audit, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process that could result in accidents.\n\n\n\nLand O' Frost adheres to the requirements of Process Safety Management and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of Process Safety Management and EPA Prevention Programs.  The Prevention Program consists of several elements and policies which are briefly outlined below: \n\n1.

Process Hazard Analysis - Process hazard analysis and review are conducted by employee teams to identify and correct any perceived hazards.  These reviews are updated regularly, or when change indicates the necessity of additional review.\n\n4.    Operating Procedures - Operating procedures are in place for all aspects of operation including emergency operation and shutdown, limits and methods to correct or avoid deviations from limits, safety and health considerations of operations and the chemicals involved, and safety system operation and function.\n\n5.    Operating Training - All operators are trained initially in the process and its operating procedures and receive refresher training not less than every three years.  In reality, operator training is a continual and ongoing process.  Operator training includes on the job training with more experienced operators and classroom type instruction.\n\n6.    Contractors - Contractor selection includes review of safety performance and programs.  Contractors are oriented to known hazards in the facility, the emergency plan, and are required to adhere to facility safe work practice procedures.  Contractor performance is periodically evaluated as necessary to assure work is completed in a safe and correct manner.\n\n7.    Pre-startup Safety Review - A safety review is conducted on any significant modification of the facility to assure that equipment is installed in accordance with design, all necessary procedures including safety procedures are in place, training is completed, and that all requirements of management of change are completed.\n\n8.

Periodically, the plan is practiced in a table top, classroom type setting, and also drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Ammonia\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur. The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of a tank. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n\n\nIt should be emphad that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is so low as to be non-existent.  Many identical and similar tanks are in existence all over the world and have been in service for many years.  We are aware of no such failure of these tanks nor, even lesser failures of a nature that would provide for an accidental release of quantities less than indicated above.  Analysis of this scenario is required by the rule, and, as such, was completed.\n\n\n\nAlternate Case Toxics - Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses. Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures. This alternate release scenario consists of a valve leak, which discharge"

The Land O' Frost plant has had no significant releases in the past five years.  During this same period they have upgraded approximately 90% of the mechanical refrigeration system to meet both personal safety and food safety goals.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant, facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs. Land O' Frost has contracted with third party contractors to assist with implementation Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously, as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
