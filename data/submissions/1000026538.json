This facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan submission must include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \r\n\r\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Land O' Frost, West Point, NE.\r\n\r\nFacility Snapshot\r\nThis facility, constructed in 1940, was owned and operated by Ocoma Foods prior to Wimmers acquisition of the plant in 1957.

Periodically, the plan is practiced in a table top, classroom type setting, and also drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Ammonia\r\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur. The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of a tank. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphad that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is so low as to be non-existent.  Many identical and similar tanks are in existence all over the world and have been in service for many years.  We are aware of no such failure of these tanks nor, even lesser failures of a nature that would provide for an accidental release of quantities less than indicated above.  Analysis of this scenario is required by the rule, and, as such, was completed.\r\n\r\nAlternate Case Toxics - Ammonia\r\nMore likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses. Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures. This alternate release scenario consists of a valve leak, which discharge"

The Land O' Frost plant has had no significant releases in the past five years.  During this same period they have upgraded approximately 90% of the mechanical refrigeration system to meet both personal safety and food safety goals.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\r\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant, facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs. Land O' Frost has contracted with third party contractors to assist with implementation Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously, as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
