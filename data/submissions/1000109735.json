Due to the more remote location of the refinery, however, close mutual aid ties have also been made with the Fire and Police Departments of the town of Krotz Springs as well as other parish emergency response resources through the St. Landry Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness.  Emergency planning meetings are held with the Mayor, Fire Chief and Police Chief of Krotz Springs.  One to two representatives from the St. Landry Office of Emergency Preparedness also participate.  Through these meetings, well defined communications protocols between Krotz Springs Refinery and the town and parish have been established.  In addition, a new community alert signal, evacuation and shelter in place protocols have been put into place. Annually, the Krotz Springs Fire Department trains with the Emergency Response Superintendent to provide a better understanding of the Krotz Springs Refinery.\n\nTraining for All Employees in Relevant Procedures\nEmployees receive training primarily through regular emergency response drills composed to simulate conceivable unplanned events that either could or have happened in the refinery.

Examples of others include: lock, tag and try procedure, trenching and excavation, Safe Line Breaking, blinding, etc. \nThese procedures and others along with proper training of employees and contractors ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change Authorization\nThe refinery's written Management of Change Authorization (MOCA) procedure provides a system to thoroughly evaluate a process change as it relates to chemicals handled or processed, design or technology employed equipment use or maintenance, procedures for operation, and changes to ancillary facilities affected by the process. \nAll changes (except for replacement in kind changes) are routinely evaluated and the complexity is also assessed to determine whether a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is required, or if a more in-depth Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) is appropriate. \nThis procedure assures that all information involved in all elements and aspects of PSM and RMP are managed and kept current.  Through this system, all necessary documentation is updated, temporary changes are tracked, approvals are obtained and all responsibilities for each MOCA are assigned to individuals and tracked to completion.\n\nIncident Investigation\nA written Incident Investigation and Reporting Safety and Health Guideline (S&HG #9) has been developed and implemented by refinery management. This guideline formalizes the process by which an accident must be reported and can be investigated by employees (and contractors when appropriate) to determine the direct and contributing causes of an incident.

As an integral part of our Management of Change Authorization procedure, a PSSR ensures that operability, design parameters, environmental concerns and safety issues are met prior to commissioning the change.  It also ensures that all employees and contractors affected by the change are notified and/or trained prior to commissioning the change.  Where necessary, field verification occurs to ensure that actual construction meets the design standards specified in the Management of Change.  If the change were determined to be too extensive or complex for a PSSR, a PHA would be performed in addition to a PSSR.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\nKrotz Springs Refinery has practices and procedures in place to ensure that equipment has been designed, constructed, installed and maintained to contain the chemicals in the process. Any equipment or system used to store, process and handle highly hazardous chemicals is included in the mechanical integrity program.  Also, any other process equipment, safety equipment and backup safety systems used to minimize the impact of a release are included in the program. \nMechanical components and systems including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, piping components, relief systems, vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, safety equipment, monitoring devices, pumps, etc. are maintained through the Mechanical Integrity program.\n\nHot-Work/Safe Work Permit Practices\nKrotz Springs Refinery has many safe work practices in place to safely perform job task in or near refinery process areas"

Operating manuals are available in hard copy format at the respective control rooms and throughout the refinery on the computer network.\n\nTraining\nKrotz Springs Refinery has a comprehensive training program in place for employees involved in operating a process.  This program is designed to address the needs of new employees and experienced operators.  New employees receive basic safety and process operator training before being assigned to a process area.  The basic training consist of classroom lectures, videos, hands-on process training on live process models, Computer Based Training, and testing of all course material.  After successfully completing the basic training, a new operator is assigned to a process unit and paired-up with an experienced operator until certification is completed for that unit.  Experienced operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that knowledge is maintained at an acceptable level.\n\nContractors\nContractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialized work on or adjacent to a covered process must meet certain training and safety performance requirements.

All of these documents are readily available to employees on a daily basis and are utilized in initial and refresher training of company employees and contractors. These documents provide technical information including materials of construction, electrical ratings, design codes and standards, relief system and safety system design.   These technical documents combined with written and implemented maintenance and inspection procedures performed by highly trained personnel assist in assuring that equipment is installed and operated as designed.\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses\nKrotz Springs Refinery utilizes PHAs to ensure that controls are in place to minimize, manage and control hazards that may potentially affect both on-site and off-site personnel and the environment. By reviewing hazards associated with anticipatable changes in the process, PHAs are designed to assist in identifying operability problems, safety issues and environmental concerns, and the associated causes, consequences, safeguards and risks.  In addition to performing PHAs that are triggered by changes, PHAs are also performed to revalidate unit PHAs at least every five years. \nOperating Procedures\nKrotz Springs Refinery has a fully developed set of operating procedures for all processes within the refinery.
