There have been no accidents in the past 5 years.\n\nB.\t Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program\nThis facility strives to meet or exceed compliance with state and federal anhydrous ammonia regulations. Training is provided for each new hire, re-hire employees, also every three years as required by OSHA or when a change to equipment or procedures. The anhydrous ammonia tank(s) and associated equipment are inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. The plant was constructed to comply with current industry standards for the storage of pressurized anhydrous ammonia.  CGA G-2.1-2014 is the standard that our facility strives to comply with.\n\nC.\tEmergency Response Policies and Programs\n\nEach employee is trained to be familiar with the emergency response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other safety meetings. This facility has an Emergency Action Plan which covers accidental releases, natural disasters, security incidents and other emergency response practices and procedures. The Emergency Action Plan for this facility is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of a comprehensive review process. The Emergency Plan for this facility includes specific instructions for the employees regarding the response procedures to an emergency.

Worst-case scenarios have been shared with the county LEPC in planning for a catastrophic event. \n\nE.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its employees as a result of the RMP covered process. In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of anhydrous ammonia with off-site consequences during the entire operation period. Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain this record.\n\nF.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nManagement of this company and facility continuously strives for ways to enhance the safety of this location. Periodic safety inspections are conducted which result in corrective actions: annual equipment inspections are also conducted.  Farmers Cooperative Association will strive to meet any new published currently accepted industry standards for the storage of pressurized anhydrous ammonia.  The company is also in the process of installing a pipe fence along the entrance of the facility that may be locked during non-operating hours to prevent unauthorized vehicles from entering around the perimeter.\n\nG.\tSummary\n\nThe employees of this company are extremely proud of our safety record and vast improvements made in both environmental stewardship and safety. We believe with our programs and policies in place and with the continued efforts of our personnel, we will maintain our safety record and our safe facility environment for the public, our customers and our employees for years to come. Crossland Construction is one of the areas of concern that have been considered as part of the community response plan for this anhydrous ammonia process."
