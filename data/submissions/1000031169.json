These resources include safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process at the East Toyah Gas Processing Facility (East Toyah) and training of operations personnel and contractors.   EagleClaw implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. EagleClaw  places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel.  Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release, and prevent or mitigate any off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nPecos, located in Reeves County, Texas, is owned by EagleClaw.  East Toyah is a natural gas processing plant comprised of natural gas liquid recovery, natural gas liquids fractionation, and natural gas treatment and compression equipment.  Produced gas and liquids are delivered to Pecos from gathering systems and pipelines.  The natural gas liquid recovery equipment is designed to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  East Toyah produces natural gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate.  The East Toyah equipment operates to separate, stabilize, treat (as necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide), compress (gas), dehydrate (gas), store (natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate), and transfer gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate to sales.  Natural gas is transported by pipeline from East Toyah and natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate are transported by cargo "

No toxic substances are present in the process.  Pecos complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements and Program 1 requirements of the U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP). \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nImplementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards in the process ensures the safety of workers and the surrounding community.  The East Toyah process has been designed using current equipment design codes and standards with appropriate safety controls.  The process design includes control systems to maintain operating parameters, such as temperature, pressures, flow, and level within allowable limits.  \n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures for the process are developed, maintained, and periodically reviewed for safe operations.  Personnel operating the process are trained on the operating procedures to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable safety and operability limits and steps to correct deviation from normal operating parameters.  Additionally, EagleClaw has developed maintenance procedures to maintain equipment integrity.   \n\n\n\nEagleClaw has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety at Pecos.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened; (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequa"

These procedures, along with training of involved personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n    \n\n    Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHazards in the process at Pecos are continually managed to ensure safe operations.  The accident prevention program is applied throughout the RMP covered process at Pecos and covers all individually listed flammable substances and regulated flammable mixtures.  The prevention program is designed and implemented to prevent accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.  Safety features are incorporated into the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of East Toyah to help prevent, quickly detect, and control a release, and to reduce the consequences of a release.  \n\n\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\nProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and combust releases.\n\nValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\nAutomatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters. \n\nContainment areas to contain liquid releases.\n\nDual mechanical seals on hydrocarbon liquid pumps, where feasible. \n\nTotal plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system.\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\nPortable fire extinguishers. \n\nPersonnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\nPersonal protective equipment.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nEagleClaw has an excellent record of accident prevention.

Changes to the emergency procedures are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Pecos is coordinated with the Reeves County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Coordination includes periodic meetings to communicate Pecos operations, contact information, and response activities. EagleClaw has 24/7 communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Reeves County LEPC Chairman, Reeves County Sheriff and Pecos Fire Department).  The LEPC would assist the Pecos, as requested, to notify the public, control traffic, and facilitate response to an incident.  EagleClaw provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated flammable substances in Pecos.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll EagleClaw personnel, employees, and contractors are encouraged to notify their supervisor of any changes or modifications to Pecos that could result in improved safety.  EagleClaw tracks and resolves all process hazard analysis recommendations.  Plans to improve safety include evaluating the operation for any additional safety needs and considering installation of process area detection systems.  \n\n"
