Markets Refrigerated DC is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process solution equipment at the facility. \r\n\r\nStater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Stater Bros.

The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 55,000 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs.\r\n\r\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nThe Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) has been developed by Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC and is included as Appendix B in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document which is maintained at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n-  To save lives.\r\n-  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n-  To protect the environment.\r\n-  To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Stater Bros. Markets Refrigerated DC facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated incident commander for the facility and the Security Department at a minimum.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\r\n\r\nThe Stater Bros.

These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\r\n\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
