This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.  \r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant is located in St. Mary parish, Louisiana.  The plant is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing LLC, and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L. P.  \r\n\r\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\r\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n* Emergency Response Programs\r\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Ogden Terminal that are regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant receives a natural gas mixture stream feed from two separately operated pipelines, which are referred to as \u00bfA Side\u00bf and \u00bfB Side\u00bf.

These purified streams are then processed into three products:  residue gas, de-methanized natural gas liquid, and condensate.  Residue gas is routed back to their respective feed pipeline for distribution and sales; condensate is transported via tank truck to outside consumers, and natural gasoline liquid is transported via pipeline to the Enterprise Pro-Mix Fractionation Plant at Napoleonville, Louisiana for additional processing.    \r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  \r\n\r\nListed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant are rich/lean oil, raw make (flammable mixture), propane, and natural gas.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the ARP program. \r\n\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results  \r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary, but rather is reflected in the data components.

Employee involvement will help insure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.  \r\n\r\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  \r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  \r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity \r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Calumet Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  \r\n\r\nEnterprise incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.
