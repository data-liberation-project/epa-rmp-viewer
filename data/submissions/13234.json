Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Silver Lake Reservoir Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n7 General facility and regulated substances information.\n7 Offsite consequence analysis results.\n7 Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n7 Five-year accident history summary.\n7 Emergency response program summary.\n7 Planned changes to improve safety.\nThe above information for the Silver Lake Reservoir Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses"

The Silver Lake Reservoir Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Silver Lake Reservoir Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\nThe Silver Lake Chlorination Station is located at 2543 Armstrong Avenue in Los Angeles, California.  The plant is bounded by West Silver Lake Drive on the west, Armstrong Avenue on the northeast, and Silver Lake Boulevard on the southeast. This facility chlorinates public drinking water at three different feed points for the Los Angeles area. The station consists of a chlorination room and a control room.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. The Silver Lake facility stores chlorine in a 25-ton bulk storage tank that is connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine. There is additional space for four one-ton containers which are stored and used only when the 25-ton bulk tank is being serviced. The 25-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line.

It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Silver Lake Reservoir facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\nIn normal operation, liquid chlorine is withdrawn from the 25-ton bulk tank to supply pressurized chlorine to the evaporators.  The bulk tank is equipped with Midland actuators on the valves that will stop the flow of chlorine when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected by the chlorine detectors.  \nIn the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is vaporized into gaseous chlorine in a water bath. Downstream of the evaporators, the gaseous chlorine travels through two pressure regulators, which lowers the pressure of the chlorine before reaching any of the four chlorinators.  A backup system of gaseous chlorine is also connected to the bulk tank with a Midland actuator and allows gaseous chlorine to bypass the evaporators and feed the chlorinators directly.  The chlorinators serve to regulate the flow of chlorine. \nFrom the chlorinators, the chlorine travels under vacuum to three injector locations where chlorine is drawn into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is then routed to the any of six different feed points on the reservoir, as well as, two reservoir outlet pipelines. \nFive chlorine leak detectors are provided to detect chlorine leaks.  The detectors signal an alarm by activating a flashing red light over the entry door to the building, as well as an audible alarm within the chlorination room and activating an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar. \nProcess control is by a progr"

Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residuals. \nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.  A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to"

The chlorine release rate to the atmosphere was defined to be 5,000 lbs./min. No passive mitigation systems were considered in determining the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere.\nEPA and CalARP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.  Since the chlorine cloud formed during the worst-case release scenario would be denser-than-air, the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model was used for performing the air dispersion modeling analysis.\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (1120F), and average humidity (61%) were used for the dispersion modeling analysis.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the worst-case scenario has offsite impacts. \nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the hazard review.

This scenario can occur if the hose, which is worn or has a defect, cracks during the withdrawal of chlorine from the bulk tank.  Once a leak develops and 10 ppm of chlorine reaches the chlorine detectors, the Midland actuators will automatically close the valves on the bulk tank, stopping the flow of chlorine from the tank.  The only chlorine that could leak from the hole would be the liquid chlorine in the line between the tank valve and the evaporators and the hold-up chlorine inside the evaporator. The length of this run of 1-inch hose and piping is approximately 48 feet.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16 inch) diameter.  The leak would last for a duration of approximately 100 seconds after the Midland actuator closes the tank valve.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine leak by the chlorine monitors installed at the chlorination facility at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.  It is assumed that approximately 60 minutes would be required for an operator or emergency response team to respond. No passive mitigation systems were considered.  Two active mitigation systems considered were the actuation of a chlorine detector and the actuation of the valves on the bulk tank.  The amount of chlorine released is 122 lbs, at a rate of 73.3 lb/min for a duration of 100 seconds.\nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint was also estimated using the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model.
