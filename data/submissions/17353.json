      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nAt Claiborne Energy, we handle flammable substances considered hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling flammable substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle flammable substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Claiborne Energy are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mexia Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nClaiborne Energy fractionates liquefied petroleum gas into natural gasoline, n-butane, iso-butane, and propane.  Transfer pumps are used to transfer feedstocks and product between the storage tanks and truck transports.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  However, a trucking company is co-located on the same property as the facility.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at Claiborne Energy are n-butane, iso-butane, and propane"

      "SummaryText": ".  The maximum quantity of n-butane that can be stored at this facility is 510,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of iso-butane that can be stored at this facility is 390,000 pounds and the maximum quantity of propane that can be stored at the facility is 480,000 pounds. \n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nClaiborne Energy's worst-case flammable release scenario would result in a release of 230,000 pounds of n-butane.  To evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp, the EPA recommended software.  Based on 230,000 pounds of n-butane released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.5-mile from the location of the storage tank.\n\nAccording to RMP regulations, analysis is required on one flammable substance with the greatest distance endpoint.  RMP*CompTM results indicate a worst-case release of 130,000 pounds of iso-butane has a hazard endpoint distance of 0.4-mile and 120,000 pounds of propane has a hazard endpoint distance of 0.4-mile.  Therefore, analysis is only required on n-butane since the endpoint distance is greater than iso-butane and propane.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as"

      "SummaryText": " a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is the failure of a flexible transfer hose while transferring n-butane between a truck transport and a storage tank.  The flexible transfer hose has a nominal diameter of 3-inches.  Excess flow valves would function to stop the flow of n-butane between the truck transport and the storage tank, thereby limiting the release to the contents contained within the hose.\n\nIn this alternative release scenario, 110 pounds of n-butane would be released.  RMP*Comp, modeled the distance endpoint for the release of 110 pounds of n-butane to no longer pose a hazard to the public as 0.02-mile. \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nClaiborne Energy observes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with applicable state codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nClaiborne Energy maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the regulated processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure the hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a \"What if\" checklist.  The studies are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n Operating Procedures\n\nClaiborne Energy"
