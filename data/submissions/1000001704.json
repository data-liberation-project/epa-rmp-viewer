Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly, a copy of which is provided to local responders.\n\nAir Products facility has hosted open houses as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety, and has an active Community Advisory Panel which meets quarterly.  Air Products makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility provides high purity chemicals to the semi-conductor industry.  The regulated process involves storage and shipment of the covered substances.  The regulated substances are hydrochloric acid (37 wt.%) and ammonium hydroxide (29 wt.%).  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.airproducts.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Based on our analysis u"

There were no specific administrative controls considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  \n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  The USEPA requires that the results of the alternative-case release scenario analysis be reported for each toxic present.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenarios for hydrochloric acid and for ammonium hydroxide could potential impact offsite public receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or active mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distances reported.  A spill in an enclosed building was considered as a passive mitigation measure in the alternative-case analysis for hydrochloric acid.  The passive mitigation measure considered in the alternative-case analyses for ammonium hydroxide is also storage in an enclosed building.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.

Our employees regularly undergo extensive training in emergency response actions and methods.  Our facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, gain familiarity with our operations, and participate in joint emergency drills.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.\n  \nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facilities continually evaluate and implement employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from hazard reviews.  We make changes to improve reliability and safety based on information developed within our organization and industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement, process re-design, and formulation substitution.
