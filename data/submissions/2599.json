Sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent prior to discharge to the environment.  This is considered to be a single, continuous process.  The gasses are delivered, stored, and drawn from one-ton containers. The Emergency Response Plan has been in existence since 1991 and is coordinated with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\n    The worst case scenario assumes the Environmental Protection Agency mandated elements as defined in 40 CFR 68.  The basis for the calculation is the release of one ton (2000 pounds) of chlorine or sulfur dioxide ( greatest quantity held in a single vessel) at 0 feet elevation, 100 degrees Fahrenheit, 10 minutes duration, with an atmospheric stability class F.\n\n    The Alternative scenario assumes the same quantity, a break in the gas withdrawal tubing at the tank connection, a temperature of 77.33xF (the mean monthly maximum, at the closest reporting station, for 5 years 1992 to 1996), and an atmospheric stability of D.
