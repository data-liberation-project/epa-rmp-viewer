The plant consists of 2 tanks, one 12,000 gallon and one 8000 gallon bulk tanks.  The total capacity of the facility is 87,400 pounds of ammonia.  The facility is designed and maintained with strict accordance with all local, state, and federal standards.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant each year and we comply with their request for facility if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The worst case scenario for our facility would have a toxic gas release of 53,000 lbs with a distance to endpoint of 1.75 miles and has the potential to affect approximately 224 residents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The employees who work in the ammonia plant are trained in safety information, hazards, operating procedures, and most importantly the maintenance pratices of our anhydrous ammonia plant.  Employees always wear safety goggles and use appropriate gloves when filling nurse tanks. "
