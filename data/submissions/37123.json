      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility:\n\nIn this gas processing plant, we handle natural gas, propane, butane, and natural gasoline.  Because the Company recognizes that these substances are flammable and potentially dangerous, we assign the highest priority to protecting the safety and health of our employees, the community and the environment.  Our policies follow the recommendations of the applicable industry recognized Codes and Standards, as well as the regulations of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the US Environmental Protection Agency.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle our products, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur Process Safety Management Program emphasizes that safety and protection of the environment supercede production goals.  The plant is designed with safety features that protect the plant from operational upsets and allow it to be safely shut down if necessary.\n\nWe have conducted operability studies to insure the safety of the process and manage changes in the process as they become necessary.  Monthly safety meetings are held with our employees as well as prior to both planned and unplanned maintenance activities.  We also have written procedures for maintenance that insures the isolation of potentially dangerous sources of energy.\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances we handle:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to separate liquefiable hydrocarbons (propane, butane, and natural gasoline) from natural gas (methane).  Our feedstock (natural gas) enters and leaves the plant via pipeline.  The plant separates the products from the gas stream, which are stored in pressurized tanks until customers travel to the plant and transport them via tank truck.\n\nThis plant recovers these pro"

Gas flowing into the plant is chilled using a propane-based refrigeration system, and then counter-currently contacted with the lean oil stream.  The \u00bflean oil\u00bf is a light hydrocarbon (a liquid at ambient conditions) that has an affinity for the products, particularly at low temperature.  After the natural gas contacts this oil it leaves the plant via pipeline.\n\nThe \u00bflean oil\u00bf is now termed \u00bfrich oil\u00bf because it now contains our products.  They are separated from the oil by heating it \u00bf the lighter hydrocarbons are \u00bfboiled off\u00bf and captured under pressure, the oil is then once again \u00bflean\u00bf and the process is repeated.  The mixture of our products is then directed to our fractionator, which separates the mix (or \u00bffractions\u00bf) into our final products \u00bf propane, commercial butane, and natural gasoline.  The fractionator takes advantage of the different boiling points of our products, and uses a series of tall towers that sequentially separate the products.  The maximum quantity of each product that can be stored at this plant is: propane, 800,000 lbs.; butane, 920,000 lbs.; and natural gasoline, 550,000 lbs.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nThe \u00bfworst case scenario\u00bf accident has been established as the rupture of our largest propane storage tank.  The tank has a maximum capacity of 300,000 lbs., but is limited by written operating procedures to 90% full, or 270,000 lbs.  It is assumed that this entire quantity is released as vapor, that it contacts an ignition source, and that 10% of the released quantity participates in the resulting explosion.  Under this scenario, the distance to the endpoint of a 1.0-psi pressure wave is calculated to be 0.50 miles.  There are public receptors within this distance from the tank.  These assumptions and calculations were made using EPA guidelines and the EPA\u00bfs"

These hoses are equipped with \u00bfexcess flow valves\u00bf that shut off the flow of product in the event that the hose ruptures.  This will limit the quantity of the release to 34 lbs. of propane.  The contents of the hose would vaporize.  For this scenario, it is assumed that the vapors ignite.  The estimated distance to the lower flammability limit is less than 0.10 mile.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.  These calculations were done following the same guidelines described above.\n\nOur general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nOur facility is subject to the provisions of OSHA Regulations (Standards \u00bf 29 CFR) Standard Number 1910.119, \u00bfProcess safety management of highly hazardous chemicals\u00bf.  Under this Standard, we have invested significant effort in developing, implementing and continually reviewing several programs designed to insure a safe working environment and minimal risk of a release.  These programs include a written plan to include employee participation, compilation of written process safety information including information pertaining to the highly hazardous chemicals present, and written operating procedures for normal, temporary and emergency conditions.  We also maintain current piping and instrument diagrams and maintain the integrity of the relief system.  We have conducted a process hazards analysis that we review a minimum of every five years and have in place a Management of Change Program and a documented employee training program.  We also maintain a Mechanical Integrity Program that tracks the condition of our equipment.\n\nProcedures are in place for incident investigations"

This plan is reviewed with our employees on a regular basis.  We hold monthly safety meetings that cover current topics as well as regular review of the fire extinguisher and respirator use.  Safety meetings are also held prior to both planned and unplanned maintenance events.  Our plan has been reviewed with the LEPC and the local volunteer fire department.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe continually monitor our industry for information on how to conduct our business more safely.  This includes changes in risk management philosophy as well as improved equipment designs and controls.  Continual training of our employees also leads to improved safety."
