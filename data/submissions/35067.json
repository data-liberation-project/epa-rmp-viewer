      "SummaryText": "Somerset Water Service Water Treamtent Plant, located at 5400 South Hwy 27, Somerset, KY, has one (1) independent chlorine injection system.  The chlorine storage and chlorination processes are located inside the chlorine process building.  The system has one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on-line and one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on standby at any one time.  The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine.  There is a vacuum regulator/check unit (Wallace & Tiernan 500 lb/day capacity) which automatically shuts off the container in the event of a break in the vacuum line.  The chlorine supply system can automatically switch between the on-line and standby chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.  The facility has a chlorine detector to monitor leakage in the chlorine storage/chlorinator room with a chlorine sensor located  about twelve inches above floor level.  The detector will automatically alarm at the facility and at themain control room panel.  The facility normally stores a maximum of three (3) one-ton containers at the site at any one time.  All containers are stored indoors in a building with doors, which seal.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and the containers are taken off the truck via the facility's hoist/crane and placed upon the dock.  Normally, the chlorinator room is secured with doors that remain closed and locked except when the system is being inspected.  Inspection takes place daily.  All chlorine containers are stored indoors.  If a chlorine leak is detected, the chlorine alarm will sound and the operator will notify the plant supervisor and appoint a standby operator.  The operator and standby will don the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and the operator will then investigate the cause of the alarm.  The exhaust fans will be activated from the exterior of the building.  The air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn into the build"

The operator and the standby are trained in chlorine safety and emergency procedures.  The operator will shut off the chlorine container.  If the leakage is not stopped, the Hazmat Team will be contacted.  The exhaust fans will be turned off.  The facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine from this covered process in the five years prior to submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP)."
