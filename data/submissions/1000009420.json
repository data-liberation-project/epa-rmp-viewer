Introduction:\r\n\r\nThis facility produces a variety of agricultural fertilizers as well as industrial chemicals.  Agrium North Bend Nitrogen Operations (NNO) produces nitric acid, ammonium nitrate solution, aqua ammonia solution, and UAN solution.  Additionally, NNO ships anhydrous ammonia without being processed.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia is the precursor chemical for most of the processes that take place on site.  Anhydrous ammonia is brought to the site either via rail or by barge and stored in an atmospheric pressure tank.  The ammonia is vaporized and oxidized over precious metals gauze at high temperatures and pressure.  This creates NOx gas that is then absorbed into water in two absorbing towers acting in succession.  The NOx absorbed into the water creates nitric acid.  The nitric acid is sold out of the facility in a number of different grades depending on customer specifications.  \r\n\r\nSome of the nitric acid is used in making ammonium nitrate (AN) solution.  This process mixed nitric acid with anhydrous ammonia vapor in the Neutralizer and the reaction forms AN solution.  This solution is mainly sold for further refining, by other companies, into explosives.  \r\n\r\nAqua ammonia (aqua) is made by absorbing anhydrous ammonia into water.  This aqua is used in many different applications.\r\nNNO also produces urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution.  This solution is manufactured by dissolving granular urea and granular AN into a solution for use as a fertilizer. The facility also has the capabilities to receive UAN via barge. Upon receipt of this product, it is then diluted down with water to lower concentrated product. Some of the AN solution produced at the site is used in the manufacture of the UAN.\r\n\r\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention and Record:\r\n\r\nNNO has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors since it was construct"

There has been one RMP reportable release of toxic chemicals in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n* In case of a reportable chemical accident, information in the RMP will be updated within six (6) months of the date accident occurred.\r\n\r\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\r\n\r\nAs part of the management system for Process Safety Management, a plant wide computer system is utilized which incorporates maintenance and process safety. Computers located in strategic locations are used to access plant files for P&ID drawings, operating procedures, Management of Change (MOC) documents, and other pertinent documents.  This system is used to provide our employees with the necessary tools and records for process safety requirements.  It plays an integral part in the safety efforts of this plant. In addition, plant personnel and full time contractor personnel routinely participate in monthly safety meetings.\r\n\r\nNNO believes safety and protection of the environment must be second nature to all employees and full time contractor personnel.\r\n\r\nEach plant employee and permanent contractor is trained to be familiar with the Emergency Response policies and procedures through safety reviews and plant safety meetings. The Emergency Response Plan is reviewed on an annual basis as part of the employee and full time contractor safety meetings to ensure refresher training.  The corporate environmental policy is also reviewed yearly.\r\n\r\nNNO requires the Emergency Response Plan be followed in the event of an emergency. The emergency alarm system is tested twice each month and an emergency drill is held four times a year.\r\n\r\nLocal LEPC and Miami Township Fire Department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Response Plan each time it is revised.  In addition, they are furnished copies of the Tier II document showing the chemicals stored o"

      "SummaryText": "NNO has a comprehensive MOC system to manage changes to the processes.  This system requires that process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards.  The MOC system verifies that existing controls have not been compromised.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all effected personnel receive training on the change.\r\n\r\nD. Worst Case Scenario:\r\n\r\nThis information was removed from the executive summary in accordance with (40 CFR 68.190 (b) (6).\r\n\r\nE.  Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Scenario: \r\n\r\nSeveral alternative release scenarios were evaluated by NNO.  The most likely release scenario would involve a release of hot anhydrous ammonia from a pressure relief valve on the ammonia vaporizer bottle in the nitric acid plant.  This part of the process involves anhydrous ammonia under elevated temperatures and pressures.  This alternative scenario could result in offsite consequences.  As part of our PSM System, NNO has in place inspection and other measures intended to ensure the integrity of our process.  Specifically, the process equipment is inspected on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nF.  Aqua Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario: \r\n\r\nSeveral possible aqua ammonia release scenarios were evaluated but the diked loading operation was selected as the scenario since it involves use of hoses and truck connections.  This alternative scenario could result in offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nG.   Nitric Acid Alternative Release: \r\n\r\nThis facility brings 98% concentrated nitric acid in by truck or rail cars.  The 98% acid is immediately diluted with product acid when unloaded to a maximum of 83-84%.  No acid is stored above 85% strength in any of the facilityA\u00bfs storage vessels.  The unloading operation was selected as the alternative scenario because this is the only time 85% or higher strength acid is in the plant.  Standard"
