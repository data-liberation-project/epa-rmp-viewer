      "SummaryText": "The Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) Linden Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) Storage Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in risk management programs, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of processes.  The policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable accidents. However, if an accidental release does occur, PSE&G gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release and contact outside responders, as needed.\n\n1.0 Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant is located in the city of Linden, New Jersey. It is situated in the northwest section of 40 acres of property. It was established in 1974 as an ancillary unit to the Synthetic Natural Gas Plant that was closed in 1989 and demolished in 1998. Operations at the facility can be classified using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 4925 or North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 22121 (Mixed, Manufactured, or Liquefied Petroleum Gas Production and/or Distribution).\n\nOperations at the plant consist of LPG storage tanks. The Linden LPG Storage Plant only occasionally has truck deliveries for filling and removal of LPG.  The only operations that occur at the Plant involve the storage and transfer of LPG.  LPG is composed of primarily propane (>90% by weight) as detailed in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS.  Therefore, all references to LPG or propane refer to the same substance unless otherwise specified.\n\n2.0 Prevention Program\n\nThe elements presented in the following section incorporate the required elements as presented in 40 CFR 68 Subpart D.\n\n2.1 Process Safety Information (40 CFR 68.65)\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant maintains several of technical documents used to promote safe operation of the process.

Specific personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Due to the nature of operations at the facility, minimal documentation is needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\nLPG-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  The plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  \n\n2.2 Process Hazard Analysis (40 CFR 68.67)\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the LPG storage and transfer process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant has used the What-If? / Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This technique has been deemed appropriate based upon the selection process presented in Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures (Center for Chemical Process Safety, 1992).  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\n2.3 Operating Procedures (40 CFR 68.69)\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutd"

The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\n2.4 Training (40 CFR 68.71)\n\nPSE&G implements an initial and refresher training program for all personnel assigned to operations at the Storage Plant.  The program includes technical training using plant-specific process information and operating procedures, as well as technical publications from the LP gas industry.  Operators are required to successfully compete competency testing including classroom and observed field operations prior to being qualified.  Refresher training for all assigned operators is provided via detailed review and simulation of operating procedures at the Storage Plant.  Operator refresher training is completed and documented at least every three years.\n\n2.5 Mechanical Integrity (40 CFR 68.73)\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing and/or implementing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n2.6 Management of Change (40 CFR 68.75)\n\nThe Linden LPG Storage Plant has a system to manage changes to the LPG storage process.
