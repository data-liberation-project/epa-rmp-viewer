Additionally, the facility has had no ammonia related accidents in its operational history beginning December 1990.\n\nThe facility will constantly strive for improved performance and reliability from all its processes. As specific process and safety improvements are identified, they will be evaluated by staff for application and implementation.\n\nThe facility has completed a Risk Management Plan and is actively implementing the RMP. The facility is in full compliance with all provisions of its RMP."

      "SummaryText": "OLS Energy-Agnews\nRMP for Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nOLS Energy-Agnews, Inc. of San Jose generates electric power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine. As part of its emissions control it injects diluted ammonia vapor into the turbine exhaust, and thus reduces NOx emissions.  The ammonia is stored in anhydrous form in a 12,000gal. storage tank, which is well anchored to prevent earthquake damage. However, per administrative controls, the facility only utilizes 85% of the storage capacity, which equates to a maximum storage of 10,200 gallons.  The ammonia is piped from there in liquid form to a vaporizer where it is turned into gas.  From there it goes to an accumulator.  From the accumulator it is mixed with air and injected into the turbine exhaust stream in the heat recovery steam generator.\n\n The facility has good preventative maintenance procedures and emergency response planning.  As part of the emergency response planning the facility has an Emergency Action Plan, which addresses every type of emergency or release the facility could expect.  The release of ammonia is specifically covered in the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP for ammonia contains all emergency contact numbers as well as operator safety and mitigation procedures.   As part of the facilityA\u00c2\u00bfA\u00c2\u00bfs accidental release prevention, training is conducted annually for employees on Hazardous Material Handling, Hazard Communication, Emergency Response, Spill Prevention, safe operation, maintenance, and emergency procedures.  There is a specific procedure for delivery and handling of anhydrous ammonia, which includes specific operational guidelines as well as emergency actions.\n\nThe facility has carried out a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  As a result or the PHA some safety improvements were made to the ammonia system and procedures.  These improvements are as follows:  1) Installation of relief valves between isolation valves on the piping between the unloading rack and the tank,"
