Modeling was performed using RMP*Comp assuming rural conditions and a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec. Rural conditions were deliberately chosen to create a more conservative approach as was the F class stability. Public impact includes, schools, residences, hospitals, recreation areas, and major commercial offices or industrial areas. Environmental impacts include state parks and wildlife sanctuaries, preserves or refuges.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios - RMP regulations require that at least one alternate release scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic chemical present. A scenario that is more realistic than the worst case scenario was selected as the alternate release case.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario simulates an ammonia railcar transfer line rupture. The event is assumed to release 6,840 pounds of ammonia during a twenty (20) minute period at a rate of 342 pounds per minute. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l) is 0.3 miles. This scenario was modeled using the RMP*Comp and assumed a complete rupture of the liquid transfer hose during railcar unloading. The loss was assumed to be for a twenty (20) minutes duration with a manual response to close the railcar unloading valve and did not account for the excess flow valve in place on the railcar in order to keep the model conservative. The estimated residential population within the area is ~4500. Public impact includes parks and recreational areas, and major commercial offices and industrial buildings. The institutions, parks, and recreational areas within the 0.3 mile radius from the release source were located using WNY street maps from Map Works, Inc. No environmental contacts were impacted. This scenario did not take into account any of the automatic devices installed in the unloading system, and is therefore considered conservative. The actual response time should be l"

On August 14, 2013, a reportable quantity of ammonia was released and reported to the proper agencies. The primary cause was a valving error which allowed steam to increase the pressure in the storage tank. The pressure relief valve lifted releasing the ammonia. The site initiated emergency response procedures and identified the cause. Proper actions were taken to mitigate the release.
