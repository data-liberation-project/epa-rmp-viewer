      "SummaryText": "wn system to notify large numbers of people within the vunerability zone.  This program and the corresponding Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which has been in effect at KAWC since May 1993, are intended to prevent and to minimize the impact of the accidental release of chlorine and ammonia.  KAWC developed the PSM and this RMP to include full associate participation in this program.  Associates who are involved in working with covered chemical processes have been involved in all aspects of these programs including the process hazard analysis.  All affected associates have received training relative to performing their job as well as the technician level of hazardous waste operator training.  Associates involved included both union and management personnel from all areas of expertise including risk management, water quality, production and maintenance.  The following positions were instrumental in the implementation of both the PSM and the RMP: Director Loss Control, Director Water Quality, Kentucky River Station Water Quality Specialist and Operations Supervisor, Richmond Road Station Water Quality Specialist and Operations Supervisor and union operating/maintenance personnel.  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for all treatment chemicals utilized by Kentucky-American Water Company.  The operating procedures for the hazardous chemicals in this plan, chlorine and ammonia, include steps to perform during normal and emergency operation limits, consequences of limit deviations, means to avoid such deviations, safety and health considerations (precautions, controls and equipment) and safety systems.  On April 25, 1996, Kentucky-American participated in a Special Needs Meeting that was coordinated through the Fayette LEPC.

      "SummaryText": "Kentucky-American Water Company operates two water treatment plants in Fayette County, Kentucky.  The water treatment plant at the Richmond Road Station uses chlorine and ammonia along with some other less hazardous chemicals to disinfect and to produce 25 million gallons of water per day.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that is stored at the Richmond Road Station is 20,000 pounds, with an average quantity of 12,000 pounds.  We have the ability to store a maximum quantity of 26,800 pounds of ammonia, with an average quantity of 14,000 pounds.  The distance to endpoint before the chemicals would be dispersed would be 3.0 miles for chlorine and 1.50 miles for ammonia. It is the intent of Kentucky-American Water Company (KAWC) to protect its associates as well as the communities it serves from the dangers that are associated with hazardous chemicals.  In order to achieve this goal at KAWC, specific controls, policies and procedures are in place to prevent and/or to minimize the risk to the community.  The Company communicates its goals and provides the locals emergency planning committee and the fire department with information pertaining to the chemicals that it uses.  Fire department personnel and employees from the City of Lexington, Division of Environmental and Emergency Management periodically visit the treatment plants to become familiar with the processes and the chemicals used, in order to respond to chemical emergencies.  A chlorine scrubber has been installed at the Richmond Road Treatment Plant to prevent the release and exposure to the Company's associates as well as to the general public.  In the event of a release, Water Company personnel would attempt to close valves and take other steps in accordance with the established Company policies and procedures.  If a leak cannot be contained, personnel will begin a notification process, which would include the notification of Company, local and State personnel.  The City would activate the City Watch ring do"
