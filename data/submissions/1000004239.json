Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\nLord Corporation operates a Saegertown Operation manufacturing facility in Saegertown, PA.  \n\nBy policy, Lord Corporation is committed \"to operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects\n\nthe environment and the safety and health of our employees and the public\".  In pursuit of our corporate \n\npolicy, the Saegertown manufacturing facility has evaluated every Risk Management Planning listed \n\nchemical onsite and developed individualized risk reduction plans as follows:\n\n\n\nA? Bromine - improved passive mitigation to prevent offsite consequences.\n\nA? Chlorine - reduced onsite storage below threshold quantity so that only general duty\n\n compliance is required.  Chlorine detection and alarm system is in operation.\n\nA? Toluene Diisocyanate - converted from bulk storage tank to drum storage so that no reasonable release \n\nscenario exceeds threshold quantity so that only general duty compliance is required.\n\nA? Hydrochloric Acid - uses from purchase through disposal do not exceed the compliance \n\nconcentration of 37 percent.   \n\n\n\nOur commitment to protect our employees and the public from accidental releases includes safety\n\nreviews, alarms, emergency training, active mitigation, and passive mitigation.  Both plant and corporate \n\nemergency teams are available to respond to an emergency release.  Equipment available to team \n\nmembers includes pagers, cell phones, hand held radios and laptop computers.  Personal protective equipment available \n\nincludes chemical resistant suits and supplied air respirators. \n\n\n\nAccess to the site is restricted (24 hour site security) to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  Bromine is the only substance handled at this facility that exceeds the threshold quantities of covered substances regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule. The maximum amount of bromine that can be stored at this facility is 52,000 lbs. (26,000"

The same properties that make bromine valuable as a reactant at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling bromine to prevent human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle bromine combined with (1) the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, (2) the safe handling procedures that we use, and (3) the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the requirements in OSHA's Employee Emergency \n\nPlans (29 CFR 1910.38) and Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation \n\n(29 CFR 1910.120). The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders, County and State agencies and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nAn up-to date Off-Site Emergency Response Plan for Lord Corporation - Saegertown, PA Operations is \n\nmaintained with the Crawford County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) Director and is an integral \n\npart of the Environmental Emergency Response Plans for the Lord Saegertown Operations (which is also \n\nmaintained by the Crawford county OEM, PADEP-Meadville Office, and the Saegertown Volunteer Fire \n\nDepartment).\n\n\n\nCopies of the Bromine Emergency Response Plan for Lord Corporation have also been distributed \n\nand reviewed with the Crawford County HAZMAT team and Saegertown VFD.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plans have been reviewed and coordinated with the Crawford County \n\nOEM, Crawford County Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT), and the Saegertown VFD.  \n\nThe above agencies tour our facility periodically and are familiar with our \n\noperations."

Lord Saegertown produces chemical specialties commercially defined as adhesives and coatings, plus several rubber chemicals.

We also manufacture industrial adhesives which are used by industry in the manufacture of laminated roll goods and structural adhesives for many manufacturing oriented applications.  Additionally, Lord Saegertown manufactures a line of urethane coatings which provide corrosion resistant painted surfaces for heavy industrial use, as well as coatings \n\nfor vinyl sheet and tile flooring applications found in the home or in institutions.\n\n\n\nBromine is one of the reactants required to manufacture two intermediate products which are eventually \n\nblended with other materials to produce several of our products.  \n\nThe processes covered by this RMP include Brominated Intermediate #1 Manufacturing and \n\nBrominated Intermediate #2 Manufacturing.  \n\n\n\nBrominated Intermediate #1 and #2 Manufacturing Processes\n\nThe Saegertown plant has handled bromine safely for more than 30 years.
