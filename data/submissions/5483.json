Lone Pine Acres, Inc is the corporate name of the farming enterprise of Lloyd A. Wulfkuhle.  Lone Pine Acres, whose corporate headquarters are in close proximity to the anhydrous ammonia tank, employs 5 full time people.\n1.  The Facilitly Policy \n    The owners, owners employees, and  management  of Agriculture Adventure are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or Local Emergency Preparedness Team, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facilitly Information.\n    The primary activity at the faciliy is the storage and filling of anhydrous ammonia tanks to be used by the six farmers only, that are in the joint venture.\n    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n   The State Environmental Agency does a yearly inspection of our anhydrous ammonia facility\n   The maximum quantity stored would be 76500 lbs in our one 18,000 gal storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a Truck tanker holding 48000 lbs.\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n   a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 76500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\n   b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of"

The accidental release prevention program.\n   The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupaional Safety and Healt Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n   a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydours ammonia in the past five years that:\n   -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant propert;y damage at the facility; nor\n   -  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,        \n      property damage, or environmental damage.\n6.  The Emergency Response Plan Program\n   - The facility has:\n   a.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38;\n   b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information \n        as required under SARA Title III  (EPCRA).\n   c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, \n        including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additonal specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nLloyd A. Wulfkuhle\nOwner/Manager"
