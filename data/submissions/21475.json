Propane is used by our customers as a fuel. Propane is received by transport truck and pipeline, and stored in underground caverns. Propane is distributed to wholesale customers by bobtails, transport trucks and rail cars. This facility has specialized equipment for unloading and loading propane. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility is propane. \n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this facility is 26,203,200 pounds. \n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario\n\nInformation concerning the Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario for this facility are contained in the appropriate Sections of the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\nEmergency Response Plan, Accidental Release Program and Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nThis AmeriGas propane and butane storage and distribution facility complies with the EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association\u00bfs Certified Employee Training Program (CETP). The worst-case scenario and alternative scenario have an extremely small chance of occurring. Our propane storage tanks are designed for propane and butane service and may remain in service indefinitely. Our preventative maintenance program ensures that our bulk storage tanks are structura"
