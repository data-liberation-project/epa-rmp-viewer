Some of the key elements are as follows:\n\n\n\nFor each covered process, associated process safety information is maintained, multiple layers of protection are in place including safe design of equipment, emergency and control devices and instrumentation, safe operational procedures, monitoring equipment, back-up systems, maintenance and inspection programs and an established training system for all employees. All of these mechanisms are in place to prevent an accidental release.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThere were no incidents at the facility in the past five years that meet the definition of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) reporting requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\n\n\nLubrizol maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) at its facility located at 155 Freedom Rd., Painesville, Ohio 44077.

      "SummaryText": "mergency response organization (ERO) in place twenty-four hours a day consisting of an incident commander and trained emergency responders. There are also certified hazardous material technicians, EMT's, rescue squad and paramedics on staff. The ERP is documented within Lubrizol Painesville's Intranet web site and is accessible to all Lubrizol-Painesville employees. The Plan includes procedures for the notification of local fire authorities and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), both groups have copies of the ERP. The Lake County Emergency Management Agency maintains a public notification and alert system capable of notifying the surrounding community as needed. There is continuous training of Lubrizol's ERO personnel on and off site and in conjunction with the local emergency responders. The ERP is updated as changes are needed.  The Lubrizol-Painesville Emergency Response & Security Superintendent is part of the County committee that revises the community emergency response plan.  A large scale drill was conducted in October 2018 with Lake County Hazmat Team, EMA, and local fire departments.  A tabletop exercise related to the facility's ERP is being planned with the LEPC. \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nAn environmental, health and safety corrective action and preventive action system exists to address all odors, spills, injuries and near misses at the facility. This system documents the incident and includes information on the root cause & mitigation measures and the individual responsible for implementing the corrective and preventive actions. A system is in place to review progress towards completion of the corrective and preventive actions and to check the effectiveness of these actions.\n\n\n\nSafety meetings and training are held on a regular basis to review these incidents to update employees on topics that will improve the overall environmental, health and safety of our facility and surrounding community.

      "SummaryText": "es are in place to help guide employees to complete tasks appropriately.     \n\n\n\nAll the RMP covered processes undergo a process hazard analysis (PHA) on a routine basis to identify any potential hazards. If there are recommendation actions from these analyses, projects are initiated to address the recommendations as part of the facility's capital improvement process.  Past projects related to RMP regulated processes have included upgrades to fire suppressant systems and distributed control systems (DCS), level transmitters on vessels, replacement of liquid and vent piping, installation of safety barricades surrounding storage vessels, installation of sensors to detect a chemical release, replacement of metering devices on material feed lines and installation of additional emergency equipment.\n\n\n\nThese are some examples of Lubrizol's philosophy of responsibly maintaining a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community.\n\n"
