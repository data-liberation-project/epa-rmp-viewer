Facility Policy\n\n                The owners, management, and employees of Sunrise Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with Wakeman fire department or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimze the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n                -The primary activity in the spring of the year is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers\n\n               - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n               - The maximum quantity stored would be 123,600 pounds in one 18,000 gallon tank and one 12,000 gallon tank.The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario\n\n               a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 74,160 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .91 miles.\n\n               b. The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .56 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n                  The facility has implemented the provisions of saftey requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA.\n\n5 The five year accident history.\n\n               a. There have been no accidental releases of anhy"

A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n             b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and coummunity right-to-know information as required under SARA title III (EPCRA).\n\n            c. a written emergency response, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve saftey.\n\n            Safety improvement is an on-going process at the Clarksfield facility as well as at all other Sunrise locations. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. At this time there are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations."
