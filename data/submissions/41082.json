              "Description": "We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: *Process Safety Information  * Process Hazard Analysis  * Operating Procedures   *Training           * Mechanical Integrity  * Management of Change  * Pre-startup Review  * Compliance Audits  * Incident Investigation  * Employee Participation\n* Hot Work Permits * Contractors\n As part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention Steps:  1.  A Process Safety Management program under 29 CFR 1910.199 the Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.    2)  Ammonia refrigeration systems designed, installed and maintained in accordance with International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR consensus standards).    3)  Training, Preventive Maintenance, and other specific programs within the context of the PSM rule and IIAR recommended practice.                                                                                                                       These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meetting our own high standards for accident prevention.",

Individual responsibilities are shown and described in our RMP Oranizational Chart and RMP Management Duties.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides activities that we have designed and implemented including:  1)  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.   2)  An overview of our emergency response program.  5) An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\n2.0   STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  \nThis Corporation processes poultry.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the refrigeration equipment to keep the poultry cool or frozen during processing or storage.  Anhydrous ammonia has been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Our facilities quality as risk management program 3 facilities because we also are covered by OSHA's process safety management rule (29 CFR 1910.119).  \nTOXICS: \n Anhydrous ammonia is a toxic gas regulated by EPA under the clean air act section 112 R Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  Fieldale Farms Corporation has anhydrous ammonia in various interconnected vessels, piping and equipment which make up our ammonia refrigeration system. Our refrigeration system contains in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold quantity and is required to comply with 40 CFR 68 in addition to 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our accidential release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effec"

Worst-case and alternative release scenarios for regulated flammable chemicals are not applicable \n5.0   FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  \nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facilities.  Within the past five years, Fieldale Farms Corporation Further Processing, has had one accidental release involving anhydrous ammonia that required evacuation or sheltering in place.  Several people went to the hospital for evaluation by a doctor, none were treated for ammonia exposure, all employees returned to work.  There were no accidental releases that caused deaths, property or environmental damage.  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  \nWe maintain an intergrated plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during an emergency response.  In the event of an emenrgency involving ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to notify the National Response Center, the State of Georgia EPD and by dialing 911for the local emergency responders.  We request the local agencies to respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire deparments and members of the fire departments have been invited to visit our facility.  \n7.0   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  \nNone."
