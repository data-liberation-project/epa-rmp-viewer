      "SummaryText": "alifornia Highway 41. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of wine products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses approximately 92,600 pounds of ammonia in its two ammonia refrigeration systems.  They are connected by piping, and are therefore considered one process. The Front (West) System has an ammonia charge of approximately 60,100 pounds; the Back (East) System has an ammonia charge of approximately 32,500 pounds. The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products.  \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\r\n \r\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\r\n- Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\r\n- In depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\r\n- Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\r\n- Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and ref"
