This Policy is implemented by our facility through specific programs designed to assure safe and responsible handling of all chemicals throughout the manufacturing process.\n\n\nRegulated Substance\nThe covered process is the chlorine storage building.  The storage area is a separate building located away from other processes on the north side of the facility site on the west side of the warehouse.  It can hold up to nine partially full one ton chlorine containers.  We have a contract with a chemical supplier to partially fill one ton chlorine containers not to exceed 1400 lbs of chlorine.

The storage area is a three-sided enclosure isolated from other structures to reduce potential fire hazards, with no sources of energy associated with the building.\n\nWorst Case\nAFTOX dispersion modeling predicts that the worst case release of 1400 pounds over 46 minutes would adversely affect an areas extending 2.29 miles from the release.

No release scenario is predicted to affect any environmental receptors.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Protection\n\nThe chlorine process area has been regulated by OSHAs Process Safety Management\n(PSM) since 1994.  The facility has successfully implemented all fourteen elements of\nthe PSM program for the covered process.\n\nThis facility has developed written operating and safety procedures for the storage and\nhandling chlorine containers.  Employees working with these containers are routinely\ntrained annually in forklift safety and chlorine handling.\n\nThe handling of chlorine is routinely reviewed by operating staff.  A process hazard\nanalysis must be preformed at least every five years and in the event of specific process\nmodifications to identify process concerns and develop solutions for them.  In addition,\nall fourteen elements of the PSM program are reviewed every three years to ensure the\nprogram is in compliance with all OSHA PSM requirements.\n\nThe EOM facility has 41 operators that are trained under the Hazardous Waste\nOperations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) 40-hour operations level.  This\nprogram requires that operators be trained in the hazardous chemical awareness and\nemergency response procedures.  These individuals are trained to respond to\nhazardous chemical releases and implement proper responses to minimize any affects\non human health and the environment.  All HAZWOPER operators receive an annual\neight-hour refresher training to maintain their certification.\n\nIn addition, the operators in the facility undergo an annual evaluation for their specific\nduties.
