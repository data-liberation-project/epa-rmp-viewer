We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n7A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's \nRMP regulation\n7A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite \nconsequences from accidental chemical releases\n7An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n7A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals \nregulated by EPA's RMP rule\n7An overview of our emergency response program\n7An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent \naccidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our \nemployees, the public, and the environment\n7The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide for \"Program 1\"\n\n\n2.STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED \nSUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces Lubricating Oils and Greases using a variety of chemicals and processing \noperations. Lubricating oil products are blends of petrolium base oils and additives into finished product that do not involve the ues of  RMP regulated substances. The manufacturing of certain grease products performed in a continuous manufacturing process do involve the use of Toluene 2,4 diisocyanate. No other Regulated chemicals are used in this activity.\n\nToxics\nToluene 2,4-diisocyanate  \n\n3.KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \nSCENARIOS\n\nThe following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information \nabout the key administrative controls and mitigation m"

The estimated exposure distance of travel does not reach any public receptors.  (Note: The RMP*Submit data section (2.6 - Release Rate) will not accept .0027 lbs./min.  The next lowest release rate, and the one we used was 1.0 lbs/min.)\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency \nresponse plan and the community emergency response plan address all \nreasonable contingency cases.\n\n4 \tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE \nPREVENTION PROGRAM AND \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place include over 70 site specific Environmental Safety Fire and Health procedures.   Most of these procedures address accident prevention and are reviewed by all employees in a three-year rotation. Several are scheduled every month for review, and employees are tested for compentancy.\n\nAdditionally our plant Incident Prevention Subcommittee reviews potentials for releases in the plant and recommends proactive corrective action. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nOur company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to \nensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HIS"

      "SummaryText": "TORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur \nat our facility.  There were no reportable accidents involving TDI at our facilty in the last 5 years.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of TDI we are prepared to conducted a formal incident \ninvestigation to identify and correct the root causes of the event.\n\n6\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the \nvarious federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency \nresponse planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and \ntraining for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment \nduring emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plans and response with the Chevron Chemical/Clark Refining ER Mutual Aid Co-op. \n\n7\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA review of TDI release specific response actions is undertaken annually.\n\n8\tCERTIFICATIONS     (signed original provided with submittal)\n  \nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified \nendpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario all processes at \nour facility is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor:\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has  had no accidental \nrelease that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR \n68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite \nimpacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a \nrelease of a regulated substance from the process(es), entry within the \ndistance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public \nemergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should \nnot enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact \nindicated in the RMPlan.
