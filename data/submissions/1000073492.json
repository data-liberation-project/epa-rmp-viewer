(WPX) at the Howling Wolf Production Pad.  This report provides the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the recovery skid system, pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. EPA RMP rule.\r\n\r\nThe system is designed to remove liquids from gas at the wellhead, having an inlet pressure between 150 and 400 psi.  The J-T valve system can generate temperatures as low as -20\u00b0F.  The leasing company uses this system to remove liquids from flared gases.  The portability of the unit allows it to easily be moved from site to site when flaring ceases.  The NGL storage tanks have an 18,000 gallon capacity. The leasing company will have four tanks onsite and the maximum fill for each tank is 14,400 gallons. The 57,600 gallons is equivalent to 328,896 lbs. of flammable liquids.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. This facility is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMP plans must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130. For flammable liquids, the threshold is 10,000 lbs.  This site can store approximately 328,896 lbs. of NGL and exceeds 10,000 lbs. threshold, thus the facility is subject to the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention r"

The population within a circle centered at the point of release and a radius equal to the distance to the flammable endpoint should be estimated to two significant digits. In addition, all types of public receptors (schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas or arenas, major commercial or industrial areas) and environmental receptors (national or stat"

The survey showed that no population is within the 0.6 mile impact radius for the worst case release. The impact area on a map is demonstrated in appendix A. The types of public receptors and environmental receptors identified within the impact area are listed in Table 2-2.  Google Earth was used to find the public receptors within the impact radius. Additionally, no environmental receptors are impacted by the worst-case release scenario."
