      "SummaryText": "Carolina Solite operates a lightweight aggregate manufacturing operation on an approximate 690 acre parcel of land, located in Norwood, NC.  The facility operates 4 rotary kilns and associated raw and finished material crushing operations in the production of lightweight aggregate.  Raw material is mined on site and processed in a series of crushing and screening operations in preparation for sale or for the production of lightweight aggregate.\n\nAn approximate 2.28 acre parcel of land wholly contiguous to the Carolina Solite facility is occupied by a fully permited RCRA waste fuel storage tank facility.  This facility, including the storage tanks and associated unloading and pumping equipment, is owned and operated by Giant Resource Recovery, Inc (GRR).  Waste fuel is received at the Giant Resource Recovery faciity via tanker truck from off site and pumped into one of several waste fuel blending tanks.  The waste fuel is blended to meet burning specifications for use as fuel at the adjacent Carolina Solite faclity for the production of lightweight aggregate.\n\nThe GRR facility consists of 6 storage tanks and associated ancillary equpment.  Waste fuel is transferred to the Carolina Solite facility via pipeline.  The GRR storage tanks are interconnected via pipelines and are also considered co-located within the tank farm and therefore, for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR Part 68, the Carolina Solite facility is considered to have one regulated process, the GRR tank farm storage facility.\n\nThe threshold quantity determination performed at the Carolina Soltie facility used several conservative assumptions as outlined in the EPA RMP guidance docuement for warehousing (1/99).  From this threshold determination, the facility developed a list of regulated substances that could potentially (although unlikely) be present in the regulated process above the applicable threshold quantity.  An off-site consequence analysis was then performed in accordance with EPA guidance to "

In addition, the facility has not had any reportable accidents under RMP and therefore, the facility is subject to the RMP Program 1 requirements.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that although the facility is subject to the Program 1 requirements of RMP (and is reporting accordingly), it has implemented an internal Risk Management Program using the Program 2 Prevention Program requirements as guide, to address all potential hazards and comply with the general duty clause of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nIn addition, Carolina Solite and GRR, as RCRA interim status and permitted facilities, respectively, have developed and implemented Contingency Plans in accordance with the Federal RCRA regulations at 40 CFR Parts 264 and 265.  These plans are maintained on site and have been coordinated with the local emergency response agencies."
