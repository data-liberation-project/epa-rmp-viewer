Another Responsible Care Code is the Process Safety Code, which is designed to prevent fires, explosions, and accidental chemical releases.  The code requires safety audits, inspection and maintenance programs, and safety training for employees and contract workers.  Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems. \n \nThe AlliedSignal Orange plant is a polyethylene wax manufacturing facility that currently employs 100 personnel with an annual payroll of $5 million.  In addition, the plant purchases in excess of $34 million worth of raw materials, supplies and services from local vendors.  The Orange plant pays approximately $1 million annually in local and state taxes.   Major uses of the polyethylene that the facility manufactures are as additives into plastics, polish, textiles, rubber, paper, paint, cable filler, inks, adhesives, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, agricultural, and wax blends.  The facility's manufacturing process involves polymerizing ethylene, with the introduction of vinyl acetate and acrylic acid into the process, to produce a variety of polyethylene waxes.   Two of these chemicals, vinyl acetate and ethylene, are on the EPA list of chemicals regulated by the RMP regulation.\n \nThe following seven elements describe policies, activities and information at the AlliedSignal Orange plant which are consistent with and support the requirements of the RMP rule.\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  \n\nIt is the policy of the AlliedSignal Orange plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, and environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improv"

This is accomplished by checking materials compatibility requirements, proper sizing and selection of equipment, providing procedures for monitoring key process conditions, employee training, conducting equipment inspections and preventive maintenance, maintaining communications systems, and observing plant security and safety rules.\n\nThe AlliedSignal Orange plant's emergency response policy involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of plant emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment, the coordination with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community.\n \n2.  The stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe AlliedSignal Orange plant operates 24 hours per day and uses two RMP regulated chemicals, vinyl acetate and ethylene, as raw materials in the manufacture of various grades of polyethylene wax. \n\nVinyl acetate is stored in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule. Vinyl acetate is purchased from an outside vendor and is delivered to the Plant via tank truck on an \"as needed\" basis.  The tanker's contents are unloaded by plant operators into an above ground bulk storage tank identified as RC-835 which is located on the east side of the plant.  The maximum capacity of the storage tank is 10,000 gallons.  Vinyl acetate is pumped from the storage tank through a piping system into the production area where it is fed into the polyethylene wax"

The plant's stationary source of ethylene consists of three reaction vessels. Ethylene is brought into the plant from either of two outside vendors via one pipeline on a continuous basis.  Ethylene is transferred through an enclosed piping system into the production area where it is fed into the three reactors in the polyethylene wax unit.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program requires the Orange plant to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of the chemicals covered by the RMP regulation. EPA defines a worst case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel. EPA also assumes that the release takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate. In addition, the release must be assumed to take place during the worst possible weather conditions. For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.\n\nIn addition, the Orange plant is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario. The alternative scenario involves a technical evaluation of a more realistic accidental release that could cause off-plant impact.  In this scenario, safety control systems are assumed to operate as designed.\n\nThe AlliedSignal Orange Plant has two chemicals that are currently subject to the RMP rule: vinyl acetate and ethylene.  Vinyl acetate is classified as a toxic substance and ethylene is classified as a flammable substance under the RMP rule. For the Orange plant, the RMP rule requires modeling the worst case scenario for one toxic (vinyl acetate in this case), the worst case scenario for one flammable (ethylene in this case), and one alternative release sc"

All active safety control systems are assumed to have failed and no emergency response takes place after the release.  The methodology recommended in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document was used to determine the impact of the release.  Under these unlikely assumptions, the vaporized vinyl acetate would reach offsite public receptors. \n\nThe worst case scenario analysis for ethylene assumed the failure of the three reactors and the release and explosion of 15,000 pounds of ethylene. Using the EPA selected endpoint, a 1 psi overpressure, for such a release, there would be would an impact at a neighboring industrial site but none on any residential population.\n\nb) Alternative Scenarios \nThe alternative release scenario for vinyl acetate involves a leak in a three-inch transfer hose during the unloading of vinyl acetate from a tank truck into its storage tank. The standard operating procedure for vinyl acetate unloading requires the operator to remain at the unloading facility throughout the unloading process, so a 15-minute response time was factored into the calculations. The vinyl acetate is spilled onto concrete and following the spill, 3,500 pounds of vinyl acetate would evaporate. The cloud formed by the evaporating vinyl acetate would impact a neighboring industrial facility but it would not impact any residential population.\n\nThe alternative scenario for ethylene involves a technical evaluation of an accidental release which could cause off-plant impact.  In this scenario, safety control systems are allowed to operate as designed.  In this alternative scenario three reactors fail venting 7,500 pounds of ethylene in the form of a vapor cloud which finds an ignition source.  Using the EPA selected endpoint"

The plant's general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n \nThe general accidental release prevention program at the AlliedSignal Orange Plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.  Also described within each of these elements are associated chemical-specific prevention steps, where applicable.\n\n4a. Process Safety Information\n\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for the manufacturing process including vinyl acetate and ethylene.  This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes.  The information compiled includes data on the safe use and handling of the regulated chemicals (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., Process Flow Diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates and storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of exceedances), and data on the equipment used in the process (e.g., Piping & Instrument Diagrams, materials compatibility, energy ratings and classification, control devices and emergency systems, ventilation systems, design basis including conformance to applicable codes and standards).  The process safety information is adequate to show compliance of the process design with generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n4b. Process Hazard Analyses\n\nProcess hazard analyses for the manufacturing process have been completed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) (OSHA Process Safety Management).  These process hazard analyses are updated and revalidated in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e), and are retained on plant for the life of the process.\n\nIn general, one or more of the following methodologies are used to complete each process hazard analys"

The Orange plant's emergency response program:\n \nThe AlliedSignal Orange plant has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility.  The plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to an accidental chemical release.  The Plan provides for both internal plant and external community emergency alerting.  The Plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the plant's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and with the local Fire Department which would direct all offsite community response activities.  The AlliedSignal Orange plant relies upon the local Fire Department and Mutual Aid (an association that makes available emergency response equipment and expert assistance in extreme emergencies) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental chemical releases. Annual in-house drills of the plant's emergency response system are performed.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n \nThe Orange plant completed a process hazard analyis for vinyl acetate in May, 1997 and for ethylene in August, 1994. As a result of these systematic safety reviews, several action items were identified and implemented to improve upon the existing safeguards and to further reduce the potential for accidental release.  The process hazard analysis for the vinyl acetate and ethylene will be reviewed and revalidated every five years.\n\nCurrently, a new tank, U-33, is being installed to replace the existing vinyl acetate storage tank, RC-835.  The new tank will sit on a solid concrete base within a concrete walled dike designed to conta"
