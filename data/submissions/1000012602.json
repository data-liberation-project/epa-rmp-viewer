The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Association (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original construction and during system modifications.  Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the"

The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses, residential development, and small agricultural properties.  The site is bordered by \"F\" Street to the northwest, 5th Street to the northeast, industrial businesses and residential development to the southeast and southwest. FTP 1 is approximately one mile east of Highway 99 and one quarter mile west of Golden State Boulevard.\n\nThe facility was originally constructed in the late-1950s.  The refrigeration system was remodeled in the mid and late-1980s.  Foster Farms purchased the plant from Butterball Turkey Company in July 1999.  Operations at the facility consist of the slaughtering, storage, processing, packaging, and distribution of poultry products.  The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and is staffed by a refrigeration operator or mechanic 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The system provides cooling for production areas, product, and water chilling.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  There have been no reportable accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years. \n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure"

The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A computerized preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.  The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  Many of the mitigation measures suggested by the process hazard analysis team have already been implemented.  Others will be implemented during the next several months. \n\nFoster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly and is scheduling completion of proposed actions.  Management responses and support will be consistent with Foster Farms' commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\n\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility.  As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farms continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community.
