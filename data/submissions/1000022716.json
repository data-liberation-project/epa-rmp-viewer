This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained refrigeration personnel are coordinated with the Lexington County Fire Department which provides emergency response expertise.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the baking, storage and distribution of bakery products.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  Information pertaining to the off-site consequences is located within the Risk Management Program at our facility.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program "

The analyses are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Otis Spunkmeyer maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\nOtis Spunkmeyer has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nOtis Spunkmeyer carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Otis Spunkmeyer to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, e"

Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established process are conducted as a regular practice at Otis Spunkmeyer. The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nOtis Spunkmeyer conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nOtis Spunkmeyer promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nOtis Spunkmeyer believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
