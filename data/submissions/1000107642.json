The Emergency Response Program:\nCarteret Facility's written emergency response program is based upon the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and health Administration and Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire and police authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. This plan has been submitted to and approved by the respective regulatory agencies and is reviewed on an annual basis.  The facility is subject to regular annual inspections by each of the aforementioned governmental agencies.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure that employees are adequately trained and prepared to respond to emergencies, they receive training in Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER), Emergency Action and Fire Prevention, Accidental Release Prevention, Environmental Awareness, and Terminal Safety Systems.  Employees also attend fire school and HAZWOPER refresher training.\n\nFinally, the facility prepares for emergencies by conducting evacuation drills; annual drill exercises, and participates in area-wide drills that are conducted by governmental agencies.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThis facility complies with applicable governmental and industry standards. Kinder Morgan has a commitment to continuous improvement of our safety program.  As such, periodic reviews of the affected programs will be conducted."

      "SummaryText": "bstances in excess of their identified threshold quantities,\n\nVAM\nCarteret Facility receives, stores, and distributes VAM, a liquid at room temperature, to both retail and wholesale customers.  VAM is used as a raw material for manufacturing polyvinyl resins, such as those used in latex paints, paper coating, adhesives, textile finishing and safety glass inter-layers. VAM is identified as a toxic liquid in the RMP and TCPA rules. VAM is received by ship, railcar predominantly, stored in atmospheric storage tanks throughout the facility, and distributed through truck and railcar. VAM operations at Carteret Facility only involve storage and transfer; no chemical reactions take place.\n\nButane\nCarteret Facility receives butane by truck and directly blends the butane into atmospheric gasoline storage tanks as it is being offloaded at various locations throughout the facility. Butane is identified as a flammable gas (specifically, a liquefied petroleum gas [LPG]) in the RMP and TCPA rules. No dedicated butane storage vessels are in place at the facility and the only butane present is the volume remaining in piping after unloading the trucks. The Butane Blending Process is dispersed throughout the facility in approximately 11 independent locations. It is highly unlikely that a release in one location will impact other locations however, in this RMP submittal, the independent butane blending locations are reported as a one collocated single process to simplify the documentation and the auditing process for the NJ-TCPA .\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable API and NFPA standards.  All affected employees have been thoroughly trained in accordance with 40 CFR 68.\n\n4.
