Incident investigation procedures are in-place to ensure any potential future release is thoroughly investigated to determine the root cause of the incident and to ensure appropriate corrective action is implemented quickly and efficiently.

The first compliance audit will occur within 2-3 years of the date of this Risk Management Program. \r\n\r\nThe facility has a detailed emergency response program to handle fire, ammonia releases or natural disasters. All employees receive training during new hire orientation sessions and periodic refresher training to ensure they understand the facility emergency response procedures. Attachments to Part 6 of the Process Safety Management Plan provide detailed coverage of potential ammonia release scenarios and the appropriate actions in response to those scenarios. In the event of an ammonia release, the employees are provided information over the facility public address system as to the nature of the release and instructions where they should assemble.

Policies and procedures are in-place to assist the staff with compliance with applicable hazardous materials rules and regulations. The Process Safety Management (PSM) Team at the facility is responsible to ensure appropriate procedures and safety measures are in-place to protect our employees and the surrounding community. The PSM Team is comprised of the Distribution Center Director, Maintenance Manager and Refrigeration Technician with assistance from the Senior Director Facility Services Engineer, Corporate Environmental, Health & Safety Manager, MDV Safety Coordinator and from the outside refrigeration contractor.\r\n\r\n\tThe facility is located in a commercial area located off of Interstate 35 south of Oklahoma City, OK. The facility consists of a two warehouses located on each side of Hattie Avenue north of SE 59th Street. The dry side warehouse is located on the west side and the perishable/frozen warehouse is located on the east side of Hattie Street. The perishable/frozen facility contains the ammonia refrigeration system and is approximately 111,000 square feet in . The property is approximately 11 acres in .  The areas around the facility consist primarily of commercial businesses and some open space. The terrain is mostly flat prairie type terrain. The site is characterized by paved areas of asphalt and concrete as well as some grassy areas around the facility. \r\n\r\n\tSpartanNash Oklahoma City receives and stores grocery product for eventual distribution to military commissaries in the Oklahoma City area, Oklahoma as well as other nearby states.

Headcount at full capacity is estimated to be approximately 125 associates (warehouse staff and drivers).\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration for this part of the facility is provided by an ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia system contains approximately 12,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. In this system, ammonia is the heat transfer medium that is compressed, cooled through the use of evaporative condensers and distributed to cooling evaporators throughout the ammonia refrigerated parts of the facility to maintain appropriate temperatures for the products stored in each area.\r\n\r\nBecause of the use of hazardous materials on-site, the facility is regulated by federal and state hazardous material rules and regulations. The ammonia, lead and sulfuric acid (used in powered industrial truck batteries) are regulated under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68). The facility has also registered with the Department of Homeland Security since its ammonia quantity exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for registration (6 CFR Part 27).\r\n\r\nFrom an occupational safety and health perspective the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard which covers the management and use of the anhydrous ammonia on-site and is required to have an emergency response plan.
