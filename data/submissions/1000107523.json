This event occurred in August of 2020, and a shelter in place was ordered, with no deaths or injuries occurring as a result of the release. The initiating cause of the event was an equipment failure allowing for unintended reaction. The second resulted in 90 lbs. of a hexane and titanium tetrachloride mixture being released in November of 2022. During this event a shelter in place was ordered, with no deaths or injuries occurring as a result of the release. The initiating cause was equipment failure due to overpressure.\ne) The site emergency response program meets the requirements of the EPA Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance. The plan defines the response organization, coordination with the local emergency response committee, equipment, response procedures, training, notification procedures, and drills. The plan is updated according to the recommendations from the system deficiencies uncovered by periodic drills and incident reports.\nf) Planned changes to improve safety \u2013 To improve the emergency response capabilities of the site, operations and other select personnel have received enhanced emergency response trainings, including basic fire brigade, hazmat, confined space rescue, and CPR/first aid/AED training. New operating buildings on the site have been built with safety features including foam suppression and water curtains. A new quick attack response vehicle was recently added to the site to further increase the on-site response capability."
