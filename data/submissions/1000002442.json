      "SummaryText": "SOURCE\nThe Jennie-O Turkey Store, Inc. facility in Barron, Wisconsin is a processing facility consisting of the slaughter, boning, cooking, packaging and shipping of turkey.  The Barron facility is subject to the USEPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for turkey processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 69,420 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 31,000 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent fill volume.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping are located outdoors.  \n\nProcess Description\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Barron facility is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The low side (i.e., low pressure) is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side (i.e., high pressure) is intended to refrigerate the product.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves (SRVs), engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  SRVs protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, accumulators, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with over-pressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the vessels.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Barron facility has carefully considered the poten"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\nThe development of an employee participation program, which includes Barron facility employees from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance). \nThe development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\nThe performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a \"What-If\" Analysis.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system. The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\nStandard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\nRefrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes o"

In addition, these contractors are periodically evaluated to ensure that they continue to work safely.\nA Jennie-O Turkey Store, Inc. refrigeration system computer preventative maintenance program is utilized at the Barron facility. This includes regular inspection and calibration of liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications. Also included is the regular inspection of major powered equipment, including compressors, pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure.\nFormal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\nEvents that might cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\nPrior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\nPlanning with the local fire department and County LEPC to ensure a rapid response to potential incidents with the system or external even"

The ERP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of anhydrous ammonia.  The ERP includes:\nCoordination with the local fire department and with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC);\nEmergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments;\nProcedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate;\nProcedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed;\nWhat personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available;\nThe preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies;\nNames of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under the plan;\nDesignation and training of a sufficient number of persons to assist in the safe and orderly evacuation of employees;\nThe names of personnel:  (1) responsible for maintenance of equipment and systems installed to prevent or control ignition, and (2) responsible for control of fuel source hazards;\nRefers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\nJennie-O Turkey Store will continue to conduct operator training, and coordinate emergency response drills with the local fire department to improve ammonia safety and emergency response."
