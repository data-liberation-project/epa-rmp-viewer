This facility is surrounded by both commercial businesses and residences. Approximately 240 people from the surrounding community are employed full-time by Henkel. The facility and its immediate neighbor were previously owned by National Starch and Chemical (NSC), a single entity. When the facility was sold, it was divided into two discrete companies - Azko-Nobel (now operates as Nouryon Surface Chemistry) and Henkel Corporation. Henkel owns the portion containing adhesives (called Unit H) and electronic adhesives manufacturing.\n\nIt is the policy of Henkel Corporation to meet all requirements established by applicable Federal, State and local safety, health and environmental regulations - this includes those set forth in the EPA's RMP Program (40 CFR Part 68). Salisbury has always put safety first and works to maintain a safe environment for its employees, environment, and the surrounding community. \n\nHenkel does not store any RMP chemicals above the corresponding threshold quantities on its portion of the site; the 10,000-gallon bulk vinyl acetate storage vessel that supplies chemical to Henkel's batch reactors (R-81 and R-82) is owned by and maintained by Nouryon, as well as on the edge of Nouryon's property. Henkel has one process that uses vinyl acetate (CAS no. 108-05-4) - this chemical may be present in a quantity greater than the 15,000-lb. threshold quantity for inclusion in the RMP program.\n\nHenkel currently maintains an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) programs for vinyl acetate. Henkel (and prior owner, NSC) has previously analyzed hazards associated with this process, developed emergency response plans for responding to potential incidents, and coordinated external emergency response resources with Rowan County Emergency Management.
