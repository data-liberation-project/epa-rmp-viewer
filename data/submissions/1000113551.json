      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nKinkaid Area Water System (KAWS) is a regional supplier of potable water to approximately 26,000 consumers.  The water plant is northwest of the City of Murphysboro, County of Jackson, in the State of Illinois.  The regulated substance is chlorine gas.  KAWS uses one ton chlorine gas cylinders for disinfecting and oxidation of contaminants found in the water source.  KAWS can have up to 10,000 lbs. of chlorine gas on site.\r\n\r\nKAWS approach to safety is an ongoing process. We give each operator a protective chemical suit, boots, and a half mask particle respirator at time of employment.  Collectively, each operator has access to full-face particle respirators; full-face shields, emergency shower and eye wash station and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).  Training and uses of the equipment is given during their six-month probationary period and annually. Safety data sheets (SDS) and operation and maintenance procedures are also provided at this time.  Periodically, refresher courses are provided.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for a one ton chlorine gas cylinder using EPAA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants, Reference Tables or Equations is three (3) miles.  This is based on the following parameters.  Quantity released: 2,000 lbs., Release rate: 200 lbs./min., Release duration: 10 minutes, Wind speed: 1.5 m/sec., Atmospheric Stability Class: F, and Topography: rural.  The estimated population within distance to the endpoint is 774.  It is difficult to conceive that the worst case scenario will occur at the water plant.  The alternate scenario is offered as a more likely occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe alternate case scenario uses the EPAA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants when there is a ruptured disk or relief valve failure with the following additions. We equipped the chlorine building with an Acute 35 chlorine gas detector system with dual sensors.  Wallace & Tiernan, In"

      "SummaryText": "c manufactured the Acute 35 chlorine gas detector system.  On the chlorine cylinder, we attached an automated chlorine shut-off valve manufactured by Powell Fabrication & Manufacturing, Inc.  This valve works automatically in conjunction with the Acute 35 chlorine gas detector system, or there is an emergency shut-off push switch on the outside of the chlorine building.  A vacuum type regulator-check unit manufactured by Wallace & Tiernan, Inc regulates the chlorine. This additional equipment and the alarm setpoint of the Acute 35 chlorine gas detector system at one (1) PPM will provide no off-site consequences.  When chlorine gas is detected at one (1) PPM the Powell automated shut-off valve closes, audible and visual alarms activate, and an exhaust fan turns on at a rate of 2082 CFS. With the above equipment in place and an ongoing maintenance schedule that is adhered to, KAWS has not had an accidental release of chlorine gas within the past five years.  \r\n\r\nThe theory of operation for the vacuum regulator-check unit is as follows.  Chlorine gas under pressure enters the vacuum regulator.  The gas pressure is reduced to less than atmospheric pressure as the gas passes through two valves that will not open unless the minimum operating vacuum is produced.  If the first valve passes chlorine gas when a vacuum is not present, the second valve will remain closed and contain the pressure in the vacuum regulator-check unit that is designed to contain full gas supply container pressure.  In the extreme unlikely event that the second valve also passes gas, a pressure relief valve will permit this gas to pass out the vent.\r\n\r\nKAWS operators will handle any incidental releases that do not involve off-site consequences. Even though the chlorine gas will be below 3 PPM, the operators will still be wearing chemical resistant suits and SCBA equipment as a precaution.  KAWS operators have been shown the basics of the Kit B chlorine repair kit (for ton cylinders).  If there is a m"

Our operator would have to tell the 911 dispatcher that Kinkaid has a major chorine leak and that the Jackson County EOC (emergency operation center) should be activated. The Jackson County Emergency Management Agency has developed chain-of-command and emergency guideline procedures for all emergency contingencies in Jackson County. The County fire departments are to respond to any hazardous-material control. If there were a major chlorine release at Kinkaid Water Plant, the Ava Fire Department would be notified first since KAWS is in their district.  The Ava Fire Chief would be the Incidental Commander (Fire Chief in charge) and would inform the EOC (emergency operation center) of the status of the disaster at the scene.  He can also call in any assistance as needed.  The Ava Fire Department has visited our chlorine facilities and is familiar with our equipment and operation.  Under the direction of the Incidental Commander, the EOC would coordinate any evacuation, emergency medical services, public notification, and etc procedures.  KAWS has submitted all information required under EPCRA (Emergency Planning and Community Right- to-Know) Act of 1986 to the Jackson County Emergency Management Agency.  This information includes but is not exclusive to the MSDS for chlorine gas and evacuation plans."
