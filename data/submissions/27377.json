FACILITY POLICY\n     THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF THE OTTAWA COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT,  AND DOUGLAS COUNTY  LEPC AND OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE TO THE PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONOMENT.\n\n     2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION AS A NUTRIENT FOR CROP PRODUCTION. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 241,400 POUNDS IN THE STORAGE TANK AND NURSE TANKS. \n\n     3. WORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n     A. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS GAS OVER A PERIOD OF 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 132,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS. THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION AT 200 PARTS PER MILLION (PPM) ) IS 2.5 MILES.\n     \n     B. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO, A 3 INCH TRANSFER HOSE IS USED AS AN ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOLLOWED BY THE RELEASE OF AMMONIA FOR 2 MINUTES BEFORE AN AUTOMATIC EXCESS FLOW VALVE INTERVENES OR REMOTE MANUAL SHUT OFF IS CLOSED AND STOPS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 11,908 POUNDS. THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION OF 200ppm) IS .83 MILES. THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT, WOULD BE A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 1 INCH TRANSFER HOSE SCENARIO FOLLOWED BY RELEASE OF AMMONIA FOR 2 MINUTES BEFORE AN AUTOMATIC EXCESS FLOW SHUT DOWN INTERVENES OR REMOTE MANUAL SHUT OFF IS CLOSED AND STOPS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WITH THIS SCENARIO WOULD BE 2,901 POINDS THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT (POINT OF"

THIS FACILITY IS ALSO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE KANSAS FERTILIZER LAW. THE OSHA STANDARD IS REFERENCED IN THE RMP REGISTRATION FORM IN SECTION 8.3 (b).\n     THERE ARE MANY HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. WE REQUIRE THAT EACH EMPLOYEE THAT LOADS AMMONIA BE TRAINED EVERY THREE YEARS AT A STATE SPONSERED TRAINING SCHOOL AND YEARLY TRAINED IN OPERATING AND SAFETY PROCEDURES AT A GIVEN AMMONIA PLANT. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO INSPECT THE AMMONIA PLANT BEFORE FILLING PROCEDURES AND BEFORE USE DO A VISUAL INSPECTION OF ALL HOSES AND VALVES TO MAKE SURE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FAILURE OF EQUIPMENT SINCE THE LAST TIME IT  WAS USED. EMPLOYEES ARE REMINDED TO FOLLOW START UP PROCEDURES BEFORE FILLING AND DURING FILLING OF  NURSE TANKS.\n\n     5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY, NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAS THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES RESULTING IN OFF SITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. THERE WAS A RELEASE OF LESS THAN 100 POUNDS OF AMMONIA FROM A LEAKING FITTING ON 09/30/2002. LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE CALLED AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND THE KANSAS STATE BOARD OF AG. SINCE THE LEAK WAS VERY SMALL AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR PERSONAL DAMAGE NO FUTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN.\n\n     6. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n     A. A WRITTEN ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910-38.\n\n     B. PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\n     C. IF A LARGE RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMM"
