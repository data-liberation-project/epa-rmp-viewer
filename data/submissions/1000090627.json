Beginning in 1994, this prevention program for processing of natural gas was formalized to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements. Program 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment. Our Program 3 prevention program, which applies to this plant, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\n1. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nWe provide for participation by our employees in all aspects of our process operations. Employees are actively involved in the maintenance of our process safety programs.\n\n\n\n2. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nWe maintain a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of our processes. These documents address:\n\n\n\na) Physical properties of hazardous substances handled\n\nb) Operating parameters of the equipment- The engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process. The available information includes:\n\n\n\n1) Operating parameters\n\n2) Simplified process flow diagrams\n\n3) Maximum intended inventories\n\n4) Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure or flow\n\n5) Consequences of deviations from established operating limits\n\n6) Design basis and configuration of equipment\n\n7) Piping and instrument diagrams, including materials of construction\n\n8) Electrical classification\n\n9) Safety systems\n\n10) Applicable design codes and standards\n\n11) Design basis for relief and , if applicable, ventilation systems\n\nc) Design basis and configuration of the equipment\n\nd) Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, including regula"

MSDS for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the Plant's MSDS book so that personnel have ready reference to this information. The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\n\n\n1) Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n\n2) Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n\n3) Reactivity and corrosivity data\n\n4) Thermal and chemical stability data\n\n5) Hazards of mixing substances in the process.\n\n\n\n3. PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The HAZOP and What-If?/ Checklist analysis techniques are the primary tools used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and company corporate management for resolution. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results at least once every 5 years.\n\n\n\n4. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThis facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as curr"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n5. TRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, this facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. To ensure training is adequate and serves the safety of employees, operators are consulted with on the type and frequency of their training.\n\n\n\n6. CONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n\n\na) perform their work in a safe manner\n\nb) have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n\nc) are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n\nd) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n\ne) understand and follow site safety rules\n\nf) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards they find during their work This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, we evaluate contractor safety programs and their past performance before selection of a contractor is made. Facility personne"

PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\n\n\n\nA PSSR is conducted at this facility for any major facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\n8. MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThis facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems and safety systems in a safe operating condition. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the MI program is quality assurance. Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\n9. SAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\n\n\nThis facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.\n\nExamples of these include; control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances"

Affected hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\n11. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nIncidents are promptly investigated that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. The final resolution if each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner. Facility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions. Local fire departments will be responsible for extinguishing fires that have gone beyond the incipient stage.  Therefore, this plan is limited to providing guidance for our employees to evacuate the facility and notify the appropriate authorities. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary, to perform their specific emergency plan duties. The emergency plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other facilities. The emergency plan changes are administered through the Plant Supervisory approval process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES to IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nWe are committed to operating this facility in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment. Our personnel utilize auditing processes to ensure that this facility complies with safe operations of its processes. Improvements to safety are a continual process at the plant and safety policy and procedure modifications are constantly evolving. Our focus now is on completing Mechanical Integrity inspections for all pressure vessels, rotating equipment and control devices to ensure no loss of containment."
