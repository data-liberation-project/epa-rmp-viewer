Save A Lot operates many reatil grocery stores throughout the East that are supplied through a distribution and transportation complex located in Wiliamsport, MD. Save A Lot's Wiliamsport Distribution Center employs oer 180 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in Storage.  Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemcials. Save A Lot's Wiliamsport Distribution Center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected nearby residenst or the environment. \n\nPursuant to RMP Regulations (40 CFR 68)and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations Save A Lot has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and teh surrounding community from exposure  to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA)for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What-If Checklist Analysis developed  through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using refrigeration contractor that operates the system and onsite operations staff from the Williamsport facility as well as experinced facilitators from outide engineering firm and corporate staff. The PHA was revalidated to meet both PSM and RMP requiremenst in August 2009. \n\nSave A Lot's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia.  The plans include preventative maintenance programs (Mechanical Integrity)for the ammonia refrigeration system, and a program for pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approa"

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.\n\nSave A Lot is commited to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Williamsport DC. Facility management is involved in the design, operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. Save A Lot's employee's have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management is committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Save A Lot should be addressed to Save A Lot's Environmental Affairs Department. "
