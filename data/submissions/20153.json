Our KEEP management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through KEEP.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe David City Terminal is one of many facilities operated by KOCH Fertilizer Storage & Terminal Company (Koch) along a 2,500 mile pipeline supplying ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used as fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance and propane is the only flammable substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the David City Terminal.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  At the terminal we receive anhydrous ammonia from a central pipeline and store it until it is loaded on trucks for distribution.  In addition to ammonia, propane is stored and used at the terminal as a fuel source for the flare and the warehouse.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide informati"

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals would be the loss of all of the ammonia in our largest vessel within 10 minutes.  In the case of the David City Terminal, this would involve our 200 ton ammonia storage vessel.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that ammonia vapors could travel, in this hypothetical case, would be 11 miles from our facility.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, and others) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  The alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario that could involve an offsite exposure to ammonia vapors, is calculated to reach 1.5 miles from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario.  Once again, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this alternative release scenario.  We selected the alternative release scenario based on our ammonia storage vessel being overfilled when ammonia is being delivered by pipeline into the facility.  If such an incident occurred, three relief valves on top of the vessel would be activated during the filling process.  These valves ensure that the entire vessel does not rupture and only a minor controllable release results.  The 2.5 inch diameter valves could release the am"

We measure the level of liquid ammonia in the vessel on a continuous basis.  If this level becomes too high, the motor-operated valve on the inlet pipe to the vessel is automatically closed.  If higher levels are then detected in the vessel, an additional reverse check valve will automatically be closed on the inlet pipe.  High pressure in the ammonia storage vessel will similarly result in the check valve being closed.  The presence of these active mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur.\n\nOur worst case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the propane in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the David City Terminal, this would involve our 30,000 gallon propane vessel.  Using the EPA OCA methods, the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.4 miles (approximately 2,100 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  The alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite damage, is calculated to reach approximately 0.2 miles (approximately 1,050 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario.  No credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  We selected the alternative release scenario based on a release of propane due to a transfer hose failure during truck unloading.

Also, an excess flow valve is positioned on the vapor return line that will shut off the line to prevent a release of propane from the vessel in the event of a vapor hose rupture. The presence of these active mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur.   \n\nWe have discussed these potential ammonia and propane releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Butler County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe David City Terminal has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1992.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n7\tWe require a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the transfer hose is properly disconnected.\n7\tWe installed continuous pilots in our flares in order to ensure no interruption in the combustion of ammonia vapors, even during high winds.\n7\tWe have a backup connection to a second power grid to ensure flares operate with minimal interruptions.\n7\tWe have ammonia detectors in our process area to ensure that an ammonia release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n7\tTank level, ammonia detection systems and equipment failure alarms are monitored 24 hours a day by Koch's Control Center in Wichita, Kansas.\n7\tWe provided truck drivers with personal protectiv"

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\t\n\t\n\tEmergency Response Program\n\t\n\tWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the David City Terminal with the David City Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response would be the Butler County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the Butler County Hospital, Utility Company, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the Nebraska State Highway Patrol.  The David City Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\t\n\t\n\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\t\n\tDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the David City Terminal.
