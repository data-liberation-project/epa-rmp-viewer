Cotton seed is prepared for planting by chemically removing lint from the seed using anhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCL) gas.  The delinted seed is treated with preservatives and other treatment chemicals and packaged for distribution.  Monsanto is dedicated to performing these activities safely and complying with all regulations regarding use of HCL, including requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Program and the EPA Risk Management Program.  The Eloy facility operates from September through May of each year and shut down for the summer months.\n\nMonsanto has not had an accidental release of HCL in over 10 years.  To protect employees and the local community from any HCL release, D&PL has developed an incident prevention program.  Elements of the prevention program include:  hazard analysis and identification, engineering design of the HCL system, operating procedures, emergency response procedures, employee training, preventive maintenance, and incident investigation.  \n\nHazard analysis identified piping leaks as the most probable cause of HCL releases.  The use of only one cylinder at a time from the cylinder trailer limits the potential release amount.  The engineering design of the HCL piping system includes excess flow detection and automatic shutoff valves.  Check valves are also installed between critical points in the HCL system to prevent backflow in case of a line rupture.  These automatic systems are backed up by manual shutoff valves.\n\nAlthough the engineering design of the system will reduce or eliminate any accidental releases of HCL, administrative controls are also used to prevent releases.  Specific personnel are trained to follow the operating procedures developed for the delinting system and on-the-job training is used to assure"
