Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe Owners, management, and employees of Helm Fertilizer Terminal, Inc. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to\n\nfarmers and co-ops.\n\n\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 18,940,000 pounds in our main storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a barge holding 5,000,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nButane \n\n\n\nButane is received, stored, and re-distributed under contract with a local refinery.  The maximum quantity stored is 16,742,318 pounds in our storage sphere.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding approximately 41,727 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our main storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 18,940,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 25 miles.  The alternate release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a trans"

The distance to the endpoint (estimated distance to 1 psi\n\noverpressure) is 2.1 miles.\n\n\n\n4.    The Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or butane in the past five years that:\n\n\n\na.    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor\n\n\n\nb.    to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.    The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\n    The facility has:\n\n\n\na.    a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Plan        Page - 2 -\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nHelm Fertilizer Terminal, Inc.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee   38113\n\nJuly 10, 2002\n\n\n\n\n\n"
