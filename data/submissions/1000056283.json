This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  This facility, commissioned in August 1988, was designed and constructed utilizing generally accepted industry codes and recommended practices such as ANSI American National Standard Institute, ASME American Society of Mechanical Engineers, TEMA - Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association, and API American Petroleum Institute.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plans have been developed to control and contain such a release.\n\n    \n\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe Willard CO2 Separation Plant is located in a rural area four (4) miles North of Denver City, Texas.  Denver City has a 2000 census population of approximately 3900.  Denver City is located in West Texas approximately 90 miles South of Lubbock, Texas and 90 miles North of Midland, Texas.  The plant processes a wet (H20) carbon dioxide rich (83% CO2) gas stream to produce a dry CO2 rich (86% CO2) natural gas stream for use in tertiary oil recovery projects in the immediate area.  Natural gas liquids (NGLs), sulfur, and hydrocarbon condensate oil are also produced from this process.  The plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.  The propane storage is the most significant volume.  The Willard CO2 Separation Plant current capacity is 160 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).  \n\n\n\n\n\n        ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\n        The Occidental Permian Ltd.

      "SummaryText": "llard Plant (WUCRP) is committed to operating maintaining all of our process (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention safeguards and programs and emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public, and the protection of the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, WUCRP personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  The document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.     \n\n    \n\n    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWUCRP is a Program Level 1 and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.  \n\n\n\n        FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Willard Plant has not had any RMP recordable incidents over the past five years.  Nor have there been any incidents with offsite consequences.\n\n\n\n(e) Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWUCRP maintains a written emergency action plan to control and contain an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provides first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  We have coordinated our emergency response activities with the Denver City, Texas emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n1.  We will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing any WUCRP incidents.\n\n2.  We will continue to develop and sha"
