      "SummaryText": "It is the intent of Environmental Management Corporation and The City of Evansville to protect our employees and the surrounding community in the event of an accidental chemical release. The Hazardous Communication Program has been incorporated into the Risk Management Program to help evaluate the needs of our facility. Informational training sessions with employees on response to an emergency has prepared them to respond in a safe manner. Our facility is a wastewater treatment plant and the wasewater is chlorinated for disinfection. One ton cylinders of chlorine are used in this process and there are usually between six and eight cylinders on site. Four cylinders are manifolded at one time. With one in use with the other cylinders on stand-by. The worst case scenerio at this facility would be the release of a one ton cylinder. Vacuum check regulators are cleaned and inspected every six months for compentency. Our system includes chlorine leak detectors on are telemetry system both inside and outside. There has never been a chlorine release that could not be routinely handled. The employees at the treatment facility have been trained to respond to leaks and are knowledgable of the emergency agencies to notify if a leak cannot be contained immediately. Mock drills will and have been conducted for all personel and community notification will be done with the cooperation of the Evansville Fire Department and Local Emergency Management Agency. Environmental Management Corporation and the City of Evansville will continue to monitor the chlorine process and take all necessary measures to prevent any accidental release. The safety of our employees and the community we serve is our number one priority. The wastewater treatment facility is installing a new security entrance gate with a card reader that will be monitored through a computer system. We will have the capability of knowing who has entered the facility and at what time."
