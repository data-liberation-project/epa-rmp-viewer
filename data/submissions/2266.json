Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n\n The management and the employees of the Norfolk  plant of Royster - Clark, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Ammonia from Anhydrous Ammonia and 44.8% Nitrogen Solution at the Norfolk facility. If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel are prepared to work with the Chesapeake City LEPC and the Chesapeake Fire Department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulatory substance handled;\n\nThe primary activity at the Norfolk facility of Royster - Clark, Inc., is the manufacture of fertilizer for sale to the agriculture user (farmer).\nAnhydrous Ammonia and 44.8% Nitrogen Solution (containing 25.2% ammonia) are received, generally by Railroad Tank Cars or occasionally by tanker trucks, stored, and used from the storage tank in the manufacture of mixed-grade fertilizers for plant nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored at this facility would be 290,000 pounds (130,000 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank filled to 80% capacity, which is a facility policy and 160,000  pounds contained in a loaded Rail Tank Car). The maximum quantity of 44.8% Nitrogen Solution stored at this facility would be 196,000 pounds in 2- 11,500 gallon storage tanks. This would be a total of 339,300 pounds of ammonia. This maximum storage would only happen in rare circumstance.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario;\n\na. The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the contents of Anhydrous Ammonia from a fully loaded Railroad Tank Car released as a gas in a ten minute period. The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia released would be 160,000 pounds, which is the capacity of the Railroad cars ordered and supplied by the vendors.

      "SummaryText": "lizer Institute's model - Degadis is  1.22 miles. This release would  affect 5,500  residents and schools. The possibility of this Worst-Case Scenario occurring is extremely unlikely as the Railroad Tank car is parked in an isolated area of the facility and these Railroad Tank cars are periodically inspected according to Department of Transportation requirements.\n\nb. The Alternate Release Scenario based on the most likely potential incident, is a release of Anhydrous Ammonia from a break in a 2\" transfer hose , during the unloading procedure, with the release discontinued in 2 minutes. The calculated quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia released would be 11,900 pounds.  The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's model Degadis is 0.56 miles. This release would  affect 500 residents.  The possibility of this Alternate Release Scenario occurring is extremely unlikely as Norfolk  personnel periodically inspect, repair, and replace involved equipment according to standard  operating procedures.\n\n4. The General Accidental release Prevention Program;\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\nof  Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc.; The standard of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard, and recommendations of Storage and Handling of Nitrogen Solutions as supplied by vendors.  \n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History;\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases of  ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or property damage on site, or has resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response program;\n\nThis facility has:\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance"

A written response program, in accordance with the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training\nThis facility's Emergency Response Program has been discussed with and reviewed by The Chesapeake Fire Department.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety;\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the effectiveness of safety practices and the proper maintenance of the facility. There are no additional specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
