      "SummaryText": "Technical Propellants, Inc. has been in business since 1964 producing aerosol proepllants for the aerosol industry.  In 1993, we built a new state of the art manufacturing facility in Grundy County.  We built this plant according to all Federal, State and Local requirements, and with strict compliance to NFPA #58, #70 and #15 specifications.  We are committed to ourselves, our employees, the public and the enviroment to operate our facility in a safe manner.\n\n1.  When we designed our plant, all of the requirements of NFPA #58 to control accidental release were built into it.  We have always strived to keep up with changing requlations for the products that we handle, and also any new safety devices that help insure that we do not have a chemical release.\n\nTechnical Propellants, Inc. takes a very responsible attitude toward safety.  Proper emergency planning and response are important elements of any safety and health program to help minimize employee exposure and injury.  We have had emergency response policies in effect at our facility since we opened,  with a copy on file with the L.E.P.C.  Since the inspection of RMP we have updated them to include written instruction to alert our employees, the L.E.P.C., and required responders in case of an emergency.  We have also included safe distances, and places of refuge, site security and control, evacuation routes and procedures.\n\n2.  Technical Propellants, Inc. is located in rural Grundy County.  Our office building is located 1,300 feet off the road.  Our tank farm which consists of 21 steel ASME pressure tanks that contain our products is North of the office building.\n\nWe are a manufacturer of aerosol propellant.  We receive raw LPG; ie - Propane, Isobutane, Butane, into our plant by rail and by trucks.  We process this material through molecular sieves that take out the impurities.  It is then stored in tanks for shipment.  We also receive into our plant Dimethyl Ether, Difluoroethane and Pentanes.  Per our customer"

      "SummaryText": "s specifications we load these materials by themselves, or blend them together into our tank trailers for shipment to our customers.\n\n3.  Our worst case release scenario would be the release of Porpane form our largest storage tank which can hold a maximum of 54,000 gallons.  According to EPA guidelines for figuring worst case release, it has to be assumed that the entire contents of the tank would be released and that all safety valves would fail and none of the manual valves could be closed.  Also, the weather condition would be such that none of the gas would dissapate into the air.If these conditions were to ever happen, using EPA RMP Comp. Version 1.06, the estimated distance to the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion would be .5 miles, which would cause an offsite impact.\n\n4.  An alternative release scenario is one that would be the most likely to happen.  This would be the rupture of a transfer hose.  This scenario is also figured to EPA guideline that all safety valves would fail and the release would last five minutes before an operator could shut off the flow of product.  In this case, using EPA RMP Comp. Version 1.06, the estimated distance to the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion would be .1 miles, there would be minimal offsite impact.\n\n5.  Technical Propellants, Inc. complies with regulations such as OSHA, PSM and NFPA #58 which have guidelines for mandatory safety equipemnt that we have installed in our facility to avoid any accidental release.  We have always, and will continue to keep up with any new and improved measures that will help us maintain the highest standards possible for safety.\n\n6.  We have not had any accidental release at our facility in the past 5 years.\n\n7.  Our emergency response program is coordinated with the LEPC, Coal City Fire Department, and the Grundy County Sherriff's Department.  Our personnel is trained react to any emergency situation that may develop in the handling of our products. Should there be any accidental re"
