Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by the EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Ajinomoto Windsor to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n1.10  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSafety at Ajinomoto Windsor is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with maintaining mechanical integrity and appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n1.20  Facility Description and Substances Handled\r\n\r\nAjinomoto Windsor is a frozen food manufacturing facility that processes, stores, and distributes frozen ready-to-eat foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n\r\nThe reg"

      "SummaryText": "ulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  In September of 2010 Ajinomoto Windsor completed the installation of second ammonia refrigeration system to accommodate production freezing requirements of a new process line.  Ajinomoto operates two ammonia refrigeration systems, which are referred to as the Frick and Mycom systems, respectively. The ammonia inventory of the Frick system exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity that triggers RMP requirements. The Mycom system contains less than 10,000 pounds of ammonia. However, the two systems are considered as a single process because they are interconnected and co-located. They are interconnected because a portion of the relief system and some of the refrigeration controls are common to both systems. They are co-located because a single event could reasonably cause a release from both systems due to the proximity of some Frick and Mycom system components.\r\n\r\nThere is no standby make-up inventory kept on site.\r\n\r\n1.30  Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nWorst-case release and alternative release scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp, a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  OFfsite receptors were defined using ESRI ArcMap 10.1 in conjunction with Goggle Maps, and Census block population data (2010).  Area weighted calculations were used to determine the total population affected by each release scenario.\r\n\r\n1.40  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nAjinomoto Windsor complies with EPA  Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published codes and standards recommended by the industry or governmental organizations.\r\n\r\nAjinomoto Windsor's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.

This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by Ajinomoto Windsor's management.\r\n\r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating the refrigeration system has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any system adjustments are handled by these qualified operators.\r\n \r\n1.50  Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents at Ajinomoto Windsor since the startup in 1992.\r\n\r\n1.60  Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAjinomoto Windsor has a written Emergency Response Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.

If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:  incident command center, emergency alarm and communication system, safe rooms, evacuation plans and assembly points, and personal protective equipment.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Ajinomoto Windsor that employees shall not take offensive counter-measures to control or contain an uncontrolled or major ammonia release.  These situations are emergencies and employees shall only take the following actions: 1) identify a release, 2) notify plant supervisory personnel, 3) evacuate as directed, and 4) isolate or contain the release from an uncontaminated or safe location.  Only in the event of a minor release (e.g. small valve packing leak, draining of compressor oil, or maintenance tasks) shall Ajinomoto Windsor employees enter a contaminated area.  These situations are not classified as emergencies.  Vapor level concentrations shall be monitored and respirators with ammonia cartridges shall be worn.  No entry shall be permitted to the area with concentration levels above 300 ppm.\r\n \r\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Portland Fire and Rescue, including the Portland HazMat Team 6.
