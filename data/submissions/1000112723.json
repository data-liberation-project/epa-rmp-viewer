This Washington Department of Labor and Industries (WA L&I) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule are required by the Clean Air Act Amendments and are outlined in Washington State Regulation WAC 296-67 and Federal Regulation 40 CFR Part 68, respectively.  This RMP/PSM was originally prepared by Lance Environmental Services, 17211 NE 95th Street, Redmond, Washington 98052.  It is intended to aid American Water Services CDM, as contract operator of Seattle Public Utilities\u0092 (\u0093SPU\u0094)  Tolt Treatment Facility, in their efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace and possibly to the surrounding community. This Program will ensure full compliance with Regulations WAC 296-67 and 40 CFR Part 68 and should serve to enhance SPU\u0092s and American Water Services CDM\u0092s relationship with our neighbors in Duvall and Carnation.\nThe major objective of the RMP/PSM for highly hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards. An effective RMP/PSM plan requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, worst-case scenario, alternate scenarios, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that impact the unit processes, were all considered in our evaluation.  The various lines of defense that were incorporated into design and operation of the Seattle Public Utilities Tolt Treatment Facility (Tolt) to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals were re-evaluated, enhanced and are we"

Containers will be stored in an enclosed building with a chlorine scrubber and gas containment provided by the building.  The facility is equipped with gas detectors that will activate the scrubber system in the event of a chlorine release.  The facility is staffed 24 hours a day by at least one licensed Water Treatment Operator.  During normal business hours there may be other employees, contractors, and/or consultants engaged in work at the facility.  The chlorine storage area at the facility is a secured zone and all access doors will be locked at all times unless authorized personnel are present.   American Water Services CDM and SPU are committed to protecting employees, the public, and the environment from the release of chlorine gas.\nNOTE:  American Water Services-CDM, Inc. will no longer have responsibility for the operations and maintenance  SPU\u0092s Tolt Treatment Facility  when its services agreement  with SPU ends sometime between January 2025 and no later than February 2026.  SPU will take over the operations and maintenance responsibility for the facility and will have the responsibility for the Rick Management Plan and the Process Safety Management"
