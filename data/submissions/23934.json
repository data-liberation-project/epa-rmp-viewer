Employees receive training on an annual basis.  The facility will notify the fire department in the event of an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEmmber Foods believes that safety improvement is an on-going process at the faciltiy.  Improvements to the program will be made as the opportunity arises."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Emmber Foods are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of ammonia.  Emmber Foods' policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in order to 1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, 2) reduce the threat to employees' health, and 3) reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\n\nSafety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used, the training of personnel, and the manner in which an accidental release is handled.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEmmber Foods Processing Plant processes beef for the food industry.  There is one regulated process at Emmber Foods, the use of anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration at the Emmber Valley Plant (total of 35,000 pounds of ammonia).  There are also two anhydrous ammonia systems at the facility which are not regulated because they are below the 10,000 pound threshold, they are the East Plant (6,000 pounds) system and the West Plant (3,500 pounds) system.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\nEmmber Foods used the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration to determine the worst-case release scenario.  Failure of the largest vessel would release 7,330 pounds of ammonia over a ten-minute period.  This vessel is located outside, therefore, no passive mitigation was considered for the worst-case release.  From the EPA guidance document, it is assumed that the release will last for ten minutes and reach an endpoint of 200 ppm a distance of 1.0 mile.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nEmmber Foods used the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration to calculate an alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario evaluated was the failure of a transfer hose.  Failure of a liquid ammonia transfer hose connected to a service valve with 1/4 inch pipe threads cou"
