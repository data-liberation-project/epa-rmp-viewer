The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Receiver\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the high pressure receivers is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration system. The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration and are also used to supply high pressure liquid to the oil cooler on the screw compressor. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. Each high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulator\n\n\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in"

Each main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulators contain low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nLiquid Transfer Vessels\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessels is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receivers. The liquid transfer vessels receive liquid from the main suction accumulators. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessels reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and activating the transfer pump which moves the liquid to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel and transfer pump can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tube"

As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver/thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nOil Cooler\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the oil cooler is to remove heat from the oil being circulated through it. The oil cooler receives liquid from the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid and vapor exits the oil cooler and is returned to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions, the oil cooler contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nAmmonia Detection System\n\n\n\nThere are three standalone ammonia sensors installed at Yosemite Cold Storage, LLC. The detection system is interlocked with the refrigeration system controls as follows:\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm, a visual and audible alarm will be activated. In addition, the PLC will notify facility personnel;\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm, the emergency ventilation will be activated and additional horn/strobe alarms outside the machinery room will be activated.\n\nThere are two ammonia detection sample systems installed at Yosemite Cold Storage LLC. Each sample system is equipped with an ammonia detector, vacuum pump, and tubing which extends to the rooms where air is sampled. The vacuum pump is used to draw air through the tubing into the detector. On intervals, the system toggles from one sample point to the next. The sample systems provide ammonia detection to non-machinery rooms as summarized below:\n\nNorth Sample System\n\nCold Storage Rooms 1-5\n\nPre-cooler Rooms A-D\n\nHallway\n\nSouth Sample System\n\nCold Storage Rooms 6-9\n\nPre-cooler Rooms A-F\n\n\n\nIf the sample system detects an ammonia concentration exceeding 25 ppm, the system will activate an alarm and also notify plant personnel of the situation through the auto-dialer.\n\nEmergency Control Box\n\n\n\nThe Emergenc"
