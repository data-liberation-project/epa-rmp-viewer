For information on chemicals, the manufacturer supplier will be contacted to obtain Material Safety Data Sheets. These forms describe the hazards that a chemical may present, list precautions to take when handling, storing, or using the substance, and outline emergency and first-aid procedures.\r\n\r\n3.2.2  Emergency Response Team employees.  The Emergency Response Team consists of the Plant Manager and two alternates.  These employees must remain behind to care for essential plant operations until their evacuation becomes absolutely necessary.  This may include monitoring plant power supplies, water supplies, and other essential services that cannot be shut down for every emergency alarm.\r\n\r\nBonded Chemicals  Mike Davis    Primary\r\n                  Roy Bevard    Alternate\r\n                  Stephan James Alternate\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n3.2.3  Emergency evacuation.  For emergency evacuation, floor plans or work place maps show clearly the emergency escape routes and safe or refuge areas to meet during an evacuation.  All employees will be trained on what actions they are to take in the emergency situations that may occur in their work place.  A minimum of four drills a year, one quarterly shall be performed and documented at each location. \r\n3.2.4  Plan revision.

Emergency Response Teams are the first line of defense in emergencies.  Before assigning personnel to these teams, it must be determined if employees are physically capable of performing the duties that may be assigned to them.  The type and extent of the emergency will depend on the facility plant operations and the response will vary according to the type of process, the material handled, the number of employees, and the availability of outside resources.  Critical Plant Operations should be trained in the types of possible emergencies and the emergency actions to be performed yearly.  They should be informed about special hazards, such as storage and use of flammable materials, toxic chemicals, radioactive sources, and water-reactive substances, to w"

It is important to determine when not to intervene. \r\n\r\nFor example, team members must be able to determine if the fire is too large for them to handle or whether search and emergency rescue procedures should be performed.  If there is a possibility of members of the Emergency Response Team receiving fatal or incapacitating injuries, they should wait for professional firefighters or emergency response groups.  Depending on the  of the facility there may be one or several teams trained in the following areas:\r\n\r\n  7.1  Use of various types of fire extinguishers.\r\n  7.2  First aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\r\n  7.3  Shutdown procedures.\r\n  7.4  Evacuation procedures.\r\n  7.5  Chemical spill control procedures.\r\n  7.6  Use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)\r\n  7.7  Search and emergency rescue procedures.\r\n  7.8  Natural disaster operation procedures.\r\n\r\n8.

The emergency plan will be reviewed periodically and updated to maintain adequate response personnel, and program efficiency.  Performance evaluation criteria will be developed and used to measure the effectiveness of periodic drills.  Drills will incorporate the use of different types of scenarios such as releases of toxic gases, chemical spills, fires, explosions, natural disasters, and personal injury. \r\n\r\n10.  Personal Protection Equipment.  Effective personal protection equipment is essential for any person who may be exposed to potentially hazardous substances.  In emergency situations our employees may be exposed to a wide variety of hazardous circumstances, including:\r\n\r\n* Chemical splashes or contact with toxic materials.\r\n* Falling objects and flying particles.\r\n* Unknown atmospheres that may contain toxic gases, vapors or mists, or inadequate oxygen to sustain    life.\r\n* Fires and electrical hazards.\r\n* Safety equipment is extremely important and our employees must be adequately protected in these situations.  Some of the safety equipment may be used includes:\r\n* Safety glasses, goggles, or face shields for eye protection.\r\n* Hard hats and safety shoes for head and foot protection.\r\n* Proper respirators for breathing protection.\r\n* Whole body coverings, gloves, hoods, and boots for body protection from chemicals.\r\n* Body protection for abnormal environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures.\r\n\r\n10.1 Equipment selection.
