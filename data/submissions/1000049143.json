Alliance Midstream, LLC is committed to maintaining the high levels of safety and operational performance of the terminal. Alliance Midstream LLC is a local company with strong ties in the community. The terminal will continue to operate with the attention to detail necessary to maintain the terminal safety systems, operator activity and safety performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Benson Terminal receives propane from rail tank cars at a tank car unloading facility located to the north of the terminal. The terminal is currently served by the BNSF Railway for delivery of tank cars. The tank cars are switched by terminal contract operators and unloaded into the terminal fixed tanks. The propane is stored on site in fixed propane storage tanks. The terminal is a fully automated terminal and is available for 24 hour truck loading by trained and qualified drivers. The terminal is equipped with multiple security systems so that only qualified and authorized drivers can gain access to the terminal and loading operations. In this process, the terminal stores the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\n\n\nToxics:\n\nThere are no listed toxic substances above EPA threshold quantitates\n\n\n\nFlammables:\n\nPropane, CAS-74-98-6\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help the terminal effectively manage the potential hazards posed by this product to the terminal employees, the community and the environmental by our handling of this substance.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention programs in place for the covered process at the facility.

The facility is also regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM). This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM\n\nelements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nBoth the facility owner, Alliance Midstream and the contract operator, Savage Services, have a strong culture of employee involvement in safety programs and accident prevention. The Benson terminal encourages its employees to participate in all elements of the safety management and accident prevention programs. Examples of employee participation include the daily safety briefings, safety specialist training and scheduled safety training and meetings. Management oversight from other\n\nSavage locations provides the opportunity for any employee to raise concerns or offer suggestions for the terminal safety program and operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Benson terminal has been in operation since 1979. During this time a considerable library of process safety information (PSI) has been developed for the equipment used in the process. This process does not involve any chemistry or reactive operations. The previous owners of the facility have provided documentation of previous PSM related activity and analysis. The new rail unloading facility has PSI including the site plans and primary equipment specifications and operating manuals. The propane is delivered to the site by rail tank car, storage in fixed tanks and loaded into highway cargo tanks for local delivery. The Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the covered chemical, propane is available in the terminal office.\n\n\n\nFor the process the facility has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, product inventory levels, pressu"

The facility ensures that the process is maintained within a safe operating envelope using process controls and monitoring instrument, trained operating personnel and a protective instrument system (e.g.,automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of constructions, design basis, pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical classification and ratings of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspections and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not weakened.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Benson terminal has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and to ensure that adequate engineering and administrative controls are in place to manage the hazard.\n\n\n\nThe Benson terminal completed a revalidation study of the previous process hazard analysis performed for this process on June 24-25, 2013. As part of the Alliance Midstream and Savage Services review of the facility, this revalidation study was closely reviewed to gain a clear understanding of past PHA efforts and to confirm that the recommendations from this study were implemented in the facility. There were no open recommendations remaining from the study. Alliance Midstream and Savage Services feel that the revalidation study is in compliance with both EPA and OSHA regulations and guidance.\n\n\n\nMoving forward, future PHA's for this facility will be conducted following the OSHA PSM guidance and following industry Best Management Practices for PHA's as recommended by the Center for Chemical P"

The team will identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as evaluating the effectiveness of the engineering and\n\nadministrative controls applied to the hazards. The team will make recommendations for improvements to the system to Alliance Midstream management.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate from intended and design functions, the terminal will update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted on this frequency for the life of the process. The results and findings of these studies are documented and retained for the life of the process. Results of any PHA study will be provided to Alliance Midstream management for\n\nconsideration and final resolution of the finding will be documented in the PHA files.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Benson terminal maintains written procedures that address the normal operations of the rail unloading process, the management of product inventory and movement within the facility, truck rack operations and facility maintenance activity. These procedures include instructions to operators for initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown. The procedures are a basis for operator training and are available to operators for reference. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nThe operating procedures also include key process parameters that provide guidance on how to respond to operating system parameter excursions for specific process or equipment operations.

The training is offered in a multi-mode presentation with demonstration, classroom and hands on instruction. All training is documented and includes written and operational observation testing methods. Training will be\n\nmaintained by any employee operating the unloading, fixed storage or truck loading operations. Training for the inspection and maintenance of covered processes is also provided ad documented for the applicable employee.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Benson terminal uses contactors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Contractors who work on or near process covered equipment are reviewed to ensure their competency to perform the work, the necessary experience and skill for the work and any required training and certification needed for the covered work. The terminal manager will ensure that the contractor perform their work in a safe manner. The terminal manager has the authority to halt any unsafe activity. Alliance Midstream and/or Savage services will evaluate the contactor safety program and performance as a part of the selection process.
