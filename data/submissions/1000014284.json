Facility staff works closely with other city and county agencies to coordinate safety and emergency response training activities.  The Berrien County HAZMAT team has conducted several sessions of training excercises at the Water Plant.\nThe water plant uses chlorine, a regulated substance, in 1-ton cylinders to disinfect drinking water for the City of St. Joseph and 3 adjacent townships.  The cylinders are used and stored indoors to protect them from weather and to help limit the release rate in the unlikely event of a chlroine leak.  Chlorine sensors continouusly monitor the air in the rooms where the chlorine is used and stored.  If more than 1 ppm of chlorine is detected, an alarm sounds alerting the facility personnel to a possible leak.  In 1994 the water plant installed new vacuum controlled chlorine process equipment to reduce the potential for an accidental release of chlorine gas.  A loss of vacuum in the process lines automatically closes the valve at the supply cylinder preventing a release of chlorine gas.\nThe worst case release scenario was modeled in 1998 according to EPA guidelines and involved the catastrophic failure of one, full 1-ton cylinder of Chlorine.  No mitigation measures were considered for the scenario.  It is not likey that such an event would occur.\nIn 1998 an alternative release scenario was considered. The water plant has no history of chlorine releases under the EPA's alternative release scenarios. The scenario considered most likely to occur was based upon typical operations and maintenance procedures.  For the purposes of the 1998 risk management plan, it was assumed that a gasket between the vacuum controlled regulating valve and the chlorine cylinders fails, causing a release of chlorine gas.  Since such a leak would occur indoors, it was estimated the release rate outdoors would be reduced to 55%.  It is not likely that this alternative release scenario wo"
