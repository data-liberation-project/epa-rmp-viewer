Smart Warehousing is engaged in the same general business as the former site operator, i.e., managing a controlled climate warehouse and distribution services company with a variety of storage areas including dry storage, chilled storage (down to -5 deg. F) and humidity-controlled environments to ensure or prolong product integrity.  The facility is located in Independence, Missouri, within an underground structure that resulted from the mining of limestone. Smart Warehousing benefits from an ambient temperature of 58 degrees F. in the underground structure, making it more efficient (than surface storage) to achieve freezer and other refrigeration temperatures. The facility has rail line connectivity and truck docks.  The refrigeration and freezer warehouses at the facility are cooled with brine, which is chilled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored above grade and piped to a below grade mechanical room where it is used to super cool a brine solution.  The brine is then piped to specified areas to refrigerate those areas.   Anhydrous ammonia is the only substance present at the facility in quantities exceeding the U.S. EPA's Risk Management Plan thresholds.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies                                                                                          \n\n\n\nSmart Warehousing has a mechanical integrity program based on industry standards for equipment inspections and preventive maintenance practices, including practices and procedures recommended by the International Institute of Ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "a Refrigeration (IIAR).  Our emergency response policy with regard to potential substantial releases of anhydrous ammonia stipulates evacuation of personnel from the underground complex (if necessary) and notification of the primary emergency response agency (the Independence Fire Department) and a pre-identified local area contract emergency response firm, HAZMAT Response, Inc (Olathe, Kansas).         \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program           \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration equipment is generally inspected each work-week day (Monday-Friday; but at a minimum of every 72 hours) by a qualified operator.  Smart Warehousing has a preventive maintenance system that calls for replacement of parts and equipment at recommended frequencies or at any sign of undue wear or impending failure.  The control system is equipped with automatic shut down features that are designed to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the event of significant upset conditions or equipment malfunction.  The facility has a 24-hour manned security presence, as well as remote video monitoring of equipment with a large ammonia inventory.         \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History      \n\nSmart Warehousing initiated operation of the storage facility on April 1, 2012.  As of the date of this submission (May 31, 2013)there have been no accidents associated with the Smart Warehousing ammonia refrigeration system which meet the RMP requirements for listing in the facility accident history.  To the best of our knowledge, there was not an RMP defined accident in the 5 years prior to Trams Industrial's acquisition of the facility.   \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nSmart Warehousing facility employees are not qualified to respond to an uncontrolled or large quantity release of ammonia refrigerant.  Due to the toxic nature of ammonia, employees will generally not respond to any release other than minor releases that do not pose an undue safety hazard (e.g., tightening a valve gasket packing)."

Facility personnel are trained to notify the Independence Fire Department and a contract emergency response firm in the event of a significant release of ammonia, evacuate to a safe point, and to provide technical support to responders as requested.  Prior to Smart Warehousing's operation of the facility, the previous operator notified the Mid-America/Jackson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Independence Fire Department (IFD) of the presence and quantity of liquid anhydrous ammonia on the site and provided the results of the Worst Case Scenario analysis to the LEPC and IFD; and made a request for inclusion of the facility in the community emergency response plan developed by the LEPC.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs stated above, Trams Industrial, LLC, purchased the subject real estate and improvements from a closed business entity on April 1, 2012, and leased the property to Smart Warehousing, LLC.  Since initiating operations, Smart Warehousing has discovered 40 CFR Part 68 scheduled compliance irregularities that relate back to the previous owner/operator (i.e., out-of-date Prevention Program Compliance Audit and out-of-date PHA Revalidation).  Smart Warehousing is taking steps to update these program audit and assessment requirements.  Smart Warehousing initiated the performance of a Prevention Program Compliance Audit by a third party in order to identify potential improvements to process safety.  The audit is ongoing as of the date of this submittal.  Process improvements, if identified from the audit, will be initiated in 2013.  Smart Warehousing also authorized the re-validation of the facility Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in 2013, as well as third party production of an updated set of Process and Instrumentation Diagrams for the regulated process.\n\n\n\nSmart Warehousing notified the Mid-America/Jackson County LEPC and the Independence Fire Department of the change of site operat"
