Documentation includes the chemical inventory of regulated substances, the container types and storage conditions, maximum amounts at the site during the year, average daily amounts and the number of days on site.\n\nIn addition, site descriptions, drawings of the facility, locations within the facility of each chemical, surface area, equipment locations as well as emergency equipment are i"
