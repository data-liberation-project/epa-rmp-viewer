This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.   The 2 regulated substances handled at this facility are stored in dedicated storage systems, material specific unloading stations are employed to ensure isolation of the materials and eliminate any chance of cross contamination.\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Specialty Chemical Production,utilizing 2 regulated substances. The first substance is Sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide is used for STB and KSS production. Both processes share a common storage tank of Sulfur trioxide.  The maximum inventory of Sulfur trioxide at our facility is approximately 45,000 pounds.   The second substance is Formaldehyde water solution. This chemical is use currently in one production process.     The maximum inventory present on site is 45,000 pounds.  Both substances are used in a batch process scheme that inherently limits the amount of material outside the storage system to small amounts at any one time.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidenta"

      "SummaryText": "l release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA- This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Arichem LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n  Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a \"What If' scenario. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of annually. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nSPCC/BMP Plan:  Spill control and containment plans, as well as Best management practices and in place, updated as required and issued to not only the City but also the Local emergency planning committee.\n   \n  \nOperating Procedures:\n   For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Arichem LLC maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is reviewed annually, certified by management for accuracy and safety. and is always accessible to operators involved in the processes, as are all MSDS for chemicals used throughout the facility, copies of which are maintained in 2 seperate locations.\n\nTraining:\n   Arichem LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating proce"

Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity\nArichem conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.    Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification, only if a modification is warranted, the prefered method is to change in kind and maintain engineering integrity.\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Arichem Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n Arichem promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a minor or catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. AU reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.   At the writing of this summary no incidents have been recorded in the past 5 ye"
