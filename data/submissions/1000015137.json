Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nAmericold is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance. This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered ammonia system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes. To insure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and time sensitive inspections will be conducted as required by RMP. Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHA's process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and EPAs Risk Management Program (RMP program) 40 CFR Part 68.90-95). \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and avoid damage to the environment or physical property damage.\n\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Americold facility is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of food products.  Product is stored in frozen, refrigerated, or dry storage warehouse and distributed by tractor trailer to various customers.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory is based on two separate ammonia systems on this property with total inventory of approximately 18,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this syst"

      "SummaryText": "em could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program.\n\n\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation and processing of perishable food products.  Through the use of two stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -25f. And +20F.\n\n\n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTrainingContractors\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years.\n\n\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the Hennepin County Emergency Management (763-745-7620).\n\n\n\nF.Planned Changes to Improve Safety are established during the process hazard analysis and compliance audits in order to meet or exceed industry best practice.  Any changes that are planned incorporate current design codes and standards."
