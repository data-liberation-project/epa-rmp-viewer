Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC (\"Mosaic\") owns and operates the Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC - New Wales (\"New Wales Plant\") located in Mulberry, Florida.\n\n\n\nThe New Wales Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in emergency drills, and meetings with local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy, which provides that:\n\na) All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public;\n\nb) All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards and procedures;\n\nc) Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals; and\n\nd) Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n\n\n\nThese corporate policies also emphasize the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and /or toxic release hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\n\n\nIt is Mosaic's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances. If an accidental release does occur, Mosaic's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Mosaic has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nAt the New Wales Plant, regulated toxic substances involved in the process include anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and sulfur trioxide; however, anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance t"

Sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide are fully consumed as intermediates in the production process, and they are not present in quantities that exceed their applicable RMP threshold quantities. The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to facility personnel health as well as contractors, and to reduce the threat to the community. Ammonia is used as a raw material, stored in pressure vessels (called \"bullets\") as a liquefied gas. The ammonia is then piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP) and Granular mono-ammonium phosphate (GMAP) plants. Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the compressors, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture. Ammonia is brought into the facility via the Tampa Bay Pipeline into four storage vessels (bullets). The capacity of each bullet is 200 tons.\n\n\n\n3. General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's PSM Standard. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the New Wales Plant exceeds the OSHA PSM threshold for ammonia, so the New Wales Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements. Therefore, the ammonia process at the New Wales Plant satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under the RMP rule. The New Wales Plant has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\n\n\n\n3.1 Prevention Program\n\nThe New Wales Plant's accident prevention program consists of the following 13 elements:\n\n\n\n1.

Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n2. Process Safety Information\n\nA variety of technical documents are maintained to help ensure that employees know about the hazards associated with covered processes. These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility, (b) operating parameters for covered process equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for covered process equipment. The New Wales Leadership Team ensures that this process safety information is updated as necessary, reviewed periodically through the document management program, and available to all employees.\n\n\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess hazard analyses of covered processes are performed and periodically updated to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the covered processes. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n\n\n4. Operating Procedures\n\nOperators and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n\n\n5. Oper"

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (c) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Written, oral and skill demonstration reviews are used to verify that an employee understands the training material.\n\n\n\n6. Contractors\n\nA program is in place to help ensure that contractor activities at the facility are performed in a safe manner. The hazards of the process where work will be performed, Mosaic safe work practices, and New Wales Plant emergency response procedures are explained to contract supervisors and their employees. The contractor is required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the facility before that worker begins work at the facility. This training is updated annually for each employee.\n\n\n\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\nSafety reviews are performed for new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation. The reviews have been embedded into the Management of Change Program and confirms that:\n\na) Adequate safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place;\n\nb) All recommendations resulting from hazard and safety reviews have been appropriately addressed;\n\nc) Equipment has been constructed and installed according to design specifications and area standards; and\n\nd) All affected employees and contractors have been informed or trained.\n\n\n\n8.

Hot Work Permit\n\nMosaic has a Hot Work Program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in its facilities. A hot work permit was created to comply with the OSHA requirements. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the permit, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed permit and work area before work can begin. Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the Hot Work Program is included in Mosaic's safe work practices orientation and annual refresher training.\n\n\n\n10. Management of Change\n\nAll proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures are evaluated and approved to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program. This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\n\n11. Incident Investigation\n\nAll incidents that actually have resulted or could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment are investigated so that similar incidents can be prevented in the future. Employees are trained to identify and report any incident. If the incident triggers an investigation, a team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 24 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n\n\n12.

Further information on the program and plan can be found in Section 5 of this summary.  \n\n\n\n13. Compliance Audits\n\nMosaic audits the accident prevention program every 3 years to be certain it is effectively addressing the safety issues of facility operations. An audit team is assembled that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in process designs specific to the facility. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\n3.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, special measures and safety features specific to ammonia have been implemented at the New Wales Plant to prevent accidents or releases. The ammonia bullets on site are visually inspected monthly and tested for thickness at appropriate intervals. The valves on the ammonia bullets piping are designed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices established by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All ammonia lines transferring liquid or gaseous product are inspected for mechanical integrity at regular frequencies. All ammonia pressure relief valves are also maintained per API and ASME good engineering practices. The majority of ammonia relief valves are placed such that "
