It has been designed to advise all plant personnel how to respond to emergency situations and what their responsibilities are during emergencies. The New Wales Plant has defined an emergency as a non-routine, unusual set of circumstances that call for immediate safety or environmental action. \r\n\r\nThe New Wales Plant also complies with Mosaic's Emergency Response Team Program. There is an Emergency Response Team on each shift that conduct training and practice drills with County Emergency Personnel. These teams are provided with appropriate personal protective and accident mitigation equipment to handle plant emergencies.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe Mosaic New Wales Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of its processes using recommendations developed through soliciting safety suggestions from employees, weekly safety inspections, internal audits, equipment inspections, and process hazard analyses. All recommendations received by the New Wales Leadership Team are evaluated and implemented if safety can be improved. On an annual basis, operating procedures are reviewed to ensure that they are accurate, and training is provided to employees and contractors on a wide variety of safety and operating topics. The New Wales Plant is constantly being modified as new and improved equipment is placed in service, which helps to maintain a very high standard of safety at the plant."

Preventive maintenance is performed on all process equipment to ensure continuous operation without incident. These are just some of the measures which help safeguard the employees, public, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe New Wales Leadership Team ensures the implementation and continuation of the PSM program. This includes writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures; training for all operators and maintenance personnel; reviewing mechanical integrity, quality assurance, and management of change programs, and contractor safety programs; and developing an audit schedule which meets the OSHA PSM standard requirements.\r\n\r\n4. Five Year Accident History\r\nThe New Wales Plant's accident history demonstrates the continuous safe operation of its chemical processes over the last 5 years. The five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage. For the five-year period prior to January 2021, there has been one accidental release that resulted in any of the listed potential consequences. The event resulted in a reportable contractor injury; however, the event did not result in impacts to the public or environment, or in a serious or disabling injury. Additional information on the event can be located in Section 6 of the RMP.\r\n\r\n5. The Emergency Response Program\r\nThe New Wales Plant has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in place to address foreseeable emergency situations and incidents involving hazardous substances on site. The EAP establishes a mechanism for providing hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, external emergency response agencies, and the community. The EAP also"

In addition, Mosaic has established an Emergency Response Team (ERT) Program to outline requirements for facility ERT including training for personnel serving on the team. Additionally, plant personnel are trained on the EAP annually which includes their responsibilities during emergencies and how to respond should an emergency occur. Further information on the program and plan can be found in Section 5 of this summary.  \r\n\r\n13. Compliance Audits\r\nMosaic audits the accident prevention program every 3 years to be certain it is effectively addressing the safety issues of facility operations. An audit team is assembled that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in process designs specific to the facility. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n3.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, special measures and safety features specific to ammonia have been implemented at the New Wales Plant to prevent accidents or releases. The ammonia bullets on site are visually inspected monthly and tested for thickness at appropriate intervals. The valves on the ammonia bullets piping are designed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices established by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All ammonia lines transferring liquid or gaseous product are inspected for mechanical integrity at regular frequencies. All ammonia pressure relief valves are also maintained per API and ASME good engineering practices. The majority of ammonia relief valves are placed such that"

Hot Work Permit\r\nMosaic has a Hot Work Program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in its facilities. A hot work permit was created to comply with the OSHA requirements. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the permit, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed permit and work area before work can begin. Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the Hot Work Program is included in Mosaic's safe work practices orientation and annual refresher training.\r\n\r\n10. Management of Change\r\nAll proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures are evaluated and approved to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program. This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n11. Incident Investigation\r\nAll incidents that actually have resulted or could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment are investigated so that similar incidents can be prevented in the future. Employees are trained to identify and report any incident. If the incident triggers an investigation, a team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 24 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\r\n\r\n12.

The reviews have been embedded into the Management of Change Program and confirms that:\r\na) Adequate safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place;\r\nb) All recommendations resulting from hazard and safety reviews have been appropriately addressed;\r\nc) Equipment has been constructed and installed according to design specifications and area standards; and\r\nd) All affected employees and contractors have been informed or trained.\r\n\r\n8. Mechanical Integrity\r\nProcess equipment is maintained to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment. The New Wales Plant's Mechanical Integrity (preventive maintenance) Program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fa"

Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n2. Process Safety Information\r\nA variety of technical documents are maintained to help ensure that employees know about the hazards associated with covered processes. These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility, (b) operating parameters for covered process equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for covered process equipment. The New Wales Leadership Team ensures that this process safety information is updated as necessary, reviewed periodically through the document management program, and available to all employees.\r\n\r\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\r\nProcess hazard analyses of covered processes are performed and periodically updated to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the covered processes. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\r\n\r\n4. Operating Procedures\r\nOperators and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\r\n\r\n5. Oper"

      "SummaryText": "hat exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.). Sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide are fully consumed as intermediates in the production process, and they are not present in quantities that exceed their applicable RMP threshold quantities. The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to facility personnel health as well as contractors, and to reduce the threat to the community. Ammonia is used as a raw material, stored in pressure vessels (called bullets) as a liquefied gas. The ammonia is then piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP) and Granular mono-ammonium phosphate (GMAP) plants. Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the compressors, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture. Ammonia is brought into the facility via the Tampa Bay Pipeline into four storage vessels (bullets). The capacity of each bullet is 200 tons.\r\n\r\n3. General Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's PSM Standard. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the New Wales Plant exceeds the OSHA PSM threshold for ammonia, so the New Wales Plant is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements. Therefore, the ammonia process at the New Wales Plant satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under the RMP rule. The New Wales Plant has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\r\n\r\n3.1 Prevention Program\r\nThe New Wales Plant's accident prevention program consists of the following 13 elements:\r\n\r\n1.
