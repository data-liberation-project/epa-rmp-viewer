This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for EthosEnergy Group's operations at the SCA II Cogeneration Plant. EthosEnergy Group has established written program and document management procedures as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nRelease prevention steps specific to aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents involving aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nEthosEnergy Group's Emergency Response Program applicable to aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.  First Responders have participated with EthosEnergy Group personnel in response drills.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which EthosEnergy Group committed to accomplish prior to the 2020 Audit have been completed. The open actions from the 2020 Audit are expected to be completed within 6 months. Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."

      "SummaryText": "in an industrial area in south Sacramento with few residences nearby.  There are 10 full-time employees at this site.  Aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) is received in bulk by truck into an enclosed steel storage tank.  The aqueous ammonia solution is pumped from the storage tank at a metered rate into the flowing turbine exhaust gas at the location of a catalyst within the exhaust duct, and reacts chemically with oxides of nitrogen to form nitrogen gas, thus reducing air pollutant emissions in  the stack gas. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of EthosEnergy Group that the receipt, storage and handling of aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) at the SCA II Cogeneration Plant be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, EthosEnergy Group has gathered safety information on aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution) and on the process, equipment and procedures involving aqueous ammonia (29.4% solution); performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by EthosEnergy Group are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\r\n\r\nEthosEnergy Group maintains policies and procedures conforming to recognized industry standards  covering the operation and maintenance of its selective catalyti"

The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce theprobability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed with the USEPA and  Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nEthosEnergy Group is the contract operator of a cogeneration facility, SCA II Cogeneration Plant, located at 5000 - 83rd St., Sacramento, CA in Sacramento County, owned by Sacramento Cogeneration Authority.
