The facility was first constructed on this site in the year 2000.   Anhydrous ammonia is used as the closed loop system refrigerant for the pre-cooling and cold storage equipment and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on the site .   The facility consists of approximately 52,000 sq ft of cold storage warehouse space and various types of fixed and mobile pre-cooling equipment on the aproximate 23 acre site.\n       The risks to the community from this facility would come from an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the refrigeration system was allowed to escape into the atmosphere.   In the worst-case scenario the toxic end point is located off the property within surrounding agricultural area, the alternate release scenario was selected as the most likely event that would have a toxic endpoiont located off of the subject property.   Events which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Evaluation were:  equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency,  vehicular accident, acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.   It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.   Direct contact with the released ammonia vapor by people inside the toxic endpoint is the main area of concern.\n       The worst case release scenario considered was as required, specifically being the release of 100% of the ammonia contained within the largest vessel over a 10 minute period.   The analytical results of this scenario show a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately 1.4 miles, which includes only farmland and one similar produce cooler.   The alternative release scenario chosen as the most likely event involves the release of 300 lbs. of ammonia over a 30 minute period from a le"
