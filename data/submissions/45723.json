Facility accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Mid-Missouri Energy are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2.  Facility information and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the production of fuel grade ethanol.  Processes involved in this activity include a) the receiving and milling of corn, b) liquification of the milled corn to produce mash, c) fermentation of the mash to produce beer, d) distillation of the beer to produce ethanol, and e) denaturing of the ethanol.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used in the liquification phase of the process to adjust Ph levels.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 78,800 pounds in one storage tank.  \n\n3.  Facility worst case and alternative case release scenario.  OMITTED\n\n4.  Facility accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and the Standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals.\"\n\n5.  Facility five-year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nCaused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or env"
