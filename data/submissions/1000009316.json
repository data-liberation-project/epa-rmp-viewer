The mission and the purpose of the System is to provide a safe, sufficient, reliable water supply and related services to the public within the Kalamazoo metropolitan area. Ground water provides 100 percent of the water served. The average daily flow rate is about 23 MGD.\n\nChlorine is used to disinfect the water prior to supply. It is a regulated chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management rules and under USEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention rules. Chlorine is delivered and used in one ton containers. The containers are stored in storage room.\n\nThe Water Supply System uses vacuum system that are inherently safe. These systems involve the use of water flowing through an eductor which creates vacuum. This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system. If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing discharge of chlorine.\n\nThe KPSWD has developed a comprehensive, accidental release prevention program as part of the OSHA PSM program. The elements of this program include:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Contractor Management\n- Hot Work Permits\n\nThe emergency response activities have been coordinated with the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the Station, that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan has been developed for the site.
