The NGL tank is included in the Little Buffalo Basin Field\nSPCC Plan.\nInitially a Joule-Thompson unit was installed at this location in April 2001, but was later replaced with a Gas Chiller in Septermber 2001.  \nThere have been no accidents at this Facility since start-up to present.    \nThe Plant is covered by the SPCC Plan to adress spills.\nThe Plant does not have a general accidental release prevention program.\nThis Plant does not have a formal Emergency Response Program. \nThe Emergency Response actions in case of a fire would be handled by the local Fire Department and emergency agencies.  Due to the remote location of the Plant and lack of populated surroundings, the responding agencies would determine the best course of action concerning a fire at this location.\nMaterials stored at this facility are reported annually on the SARA Title III filings.\nSafety training for the employees is performed by a third party firm and the SPCC training is done annually.\nA 0.2 mile radius of exposure was calculated using the USEPA RMP*Comp Ver. 1.07 Worst-case Scenario, Category Flammable Liquid, Release Type Vapor Cloud Explosion.\nA portion of the USGS 7.5 Minute Little Buffalo Basin, Wyoming Topographic Quadrangle map (Figure 1) depicting the location of the NGL and surrounding area is included.  Depicted on the map is the Little Buffalo Basin Camp, which is actually the Little Buffalo Basin Field Office.  The Little Buffalo Basin Gas Plant meets the PSM OSHA Directive definintion of a \"normally unoccupied remote facility\".  This Plant is maintained by Citation employees who visit the facility periodically to check operation and perform necessary operations and mantenance (O&M) tasks.  Citation will not permanently station employees at thi"
