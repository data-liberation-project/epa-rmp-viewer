Annual inspections by Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) are made on facilities and portable nurse tanks.  Frequent site inspections are made by management and safety consultants.  Equipment  inspections, maintenance and employee training are conducted prior to every application season.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere was am accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia on May 24, 2014.
