      "SummaryText": "The City of Beacon Wastewater Treatment Facility processes municipal wastewater and has a design capacity of 6 million gallons per day (MGD).  The wastewater treatment process incorporates primary settling, activated sludge, final settling, sludge dewatering and disinfection using chlorine gas.  The facility is operated such that it meets the limits established in its State Pollution Discharge Elimination System (S.P.D.E.S.) permit in the most cost effective and safe manner.\n\nThe City of Beacon Wastewater Treatment facility has developed a combined EPA Risk Management/OSHA Process Safety Management Plan to cover the storage and transfer of chlorine, which is the only toxic or flammable substance listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 used at the facility.  The plant operating staff are committed to the safe handling of chlorine.  The current emergency response program directs the facility personnel to contact the local fire department in the event of a chlorine leak.  The facility personnel have received chlorine safety training from the chlorine supplier.\n\nThe facility has a chlorine injection system with two injectors.  The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine, and has one-one ton cylinder of chlorine on-line at a time.  Another cylinder is designated as a backup, and must be manually connected to the system when the primary cylinder is empty.  \n\nThe facility normally stores a maximum of seven (7) one-ton cylinders at the site at any one time.  The on-line cylinder and the designated backup cylinder are stored indoors on scales in a building with doors, which seal.  Normally the scale room is sealed with doors that remain closed unless a chlorine cylinder is being replaced.  The remaining cylinders are stored outdoors in a roofed area.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and the cylinders are transferred from the truck and moved into the storage area.  The chlorinators are in a separate room.  \n\nThe facility ha"

Chlorine sensors are located at six inches above floor level.  The detector will alarm audibly and visually at the main control room panel and automatically start the ventilation fans and activate the emergency shutoff system for the cylinder valves.  \n\nThe facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine from this covered process."
