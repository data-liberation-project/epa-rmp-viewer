Lyondell has asked the EPA to make an official determination on the applicability of the RMP regulations to the Massey Railyard.  As of June 21, 1999, Lyondell has only received conflicting individual opinions from EPA personnel and is still waiting to receive the official EPA determination.\n\nTherefore, we are filing a Risk Management Plan for the Massey Railyard in case the official determination indicates that Massey Railyard is covered by RMP.\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nHISTORY\n\nLyondell Chemical Company, one of the world's largest chemical companies, is comprised of wholly owned businesses operating under the Lyondell name and major ownership positions in Equistar Chemicals, LP, Lyondell-Citgo Refining LP and Lyondell Methanol Company, LP.  In 1998, Lyondell acquired the assets of ARCO Chemical Company (ACC), including the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia.  These facilities are located within the existing Union Carbide Corporation's South Charleston plant, and within the Rhone-Poulenc plant in Institute. Also included in this acquisition were urethanes research and development facilities located within the Union Carbide South Charleston Technical Center.\n\nWorldwide, the Lyondell enterprise operates in 15 countries, has approximately 11,000 employees, and consists of businesses with more than $17 billion in assets.  In West Virginia, Lyondell directly employs about 135 people and provides employment for about 135 people under contract from Union Carbide and Rhone-Poulenc. \n\n\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nThe Lyondell enterprise produces quality chemicals, polymers, and refined petroleum products that form the basis for plastics and synthetics of all kinds.

Polyols are used primarily in polyurethane foams for products ranging from bedding and furniture, to automotive applications such as seat\ncushions and energy absorbing instrument panels and side panels. Nearly two-thirds of all the auto seats in the U.S. today are made using the Lyondell polyols products from the Kanawha Valley. Other polyols products we make here are used by our customers for applications as diverse as roof coatings, varnishes, roller blade wheels, and bowling balls.  All of the products are shipped to customers in other states or are exported to Europe, Asia, and South America.\n\nAnother product from our West Virginia facilities is technology. The scientists and technicians at our South Charleston Technical Center work closely together with our manufacturing organization here to develop new or improved polyols products and process technologies. These new technologies can then be used by other Lyondell polyols manufacturing sites around the world.\n\n\nRESPONSIBLE CARE.\n\nLyondell Chemical Company is fully committed to the principles of Responsible Care, which is an initiative of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) to improve industry performance in the areas of environment, health and safety, to improve the industry's safe management of chemicals, and to respond to public concerns.  Since 1990, emissions of hazardous chemicals to the air from the Lyondell West Virginia facilities have been reduced by over 90% through improving processes and eliminating inefficient operations.

Manufacturing Excellence, launched in 1991, is a program of corporate standards which incorporates all of the Responsible Care.  codes and Lyondell's own rigorous management systems.  Manufacturing Excellence incorporates a system of Manufacturing Excellence Standards which ensure superior performance and continuous improvement in the following five key areas: safety and health, environmental, product quality, manufacturing reliability, and efficiency.  The Manufacturing Excellence System consists of 43 performance standards in the five key areas listed above, and a system of Lyondell Facility Audits and Third Party Audits to evaluate compliance with the performance standards.  The Third Party Audit System evaluates the regulatory compliance, reliability, and liability associated with the following types of third parties:  Waste Sites, Terminals, Tollers, Key Suppliers, and Transporters.  A rigorous auditing process evaluates how well our facility is meeting the high standards of Manufacturing Excellence.

Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Program rule requires that covered stationary sources handling regulated substances conduct off-site consequence analyses (OCA) to evaluate the potential off-site impact of a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) for each regulated toxic chemical on site.  RMP also requires covered sources to evaluate one worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario for a single chemical representing the class of flammables.  \n\nAll of these scenarios are developed using guidelines established in the RMP rule.  In developing worst-case scenarios, companies must presume the release of the entire quantity of the largest container of a regulated chemical over a 10-minute period.  Only passive mitigation systems, such as those that do not require energy or action by an employee to initiate can be considered.  U.S. EPA acknowledges that these worst-case scenarios are unlikely to occur, so the RMP rule also requires that companies develop alternative release scenarios based on more credible release assumptions. \n\nAlternative release scenarios differ from worst-case scenarios in several important ways.  They may be based on actual incident history or on events which are more likely to occur, and allow the use of both active and passive mitigation to reduce the potential"

      "SummaryText": "impact of a release on the community outside the facility.\n\nEPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Tables were used for evaluating the consequences of the WCS and ARS for both regulated flammable and toxic materials.  Use of these tables resulted in the determination of a release endpoint distance. The EPA-recommended LANDVIEW program was used to estimate the number of people potentially affected in each scenario.  The West Virginia Kanawha/Putnam County Emergency Services Maps and CD-ROM Program were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within the scenario endpoint distance.\n\nAccording to the RMP rule, the release endpoint distance is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected for each scenario.  It is intended to ensure that potential risks to the public health are recognized.  For toxic releases, the endpoint is the distance beyond which chemical concentrations are low enough that an average individual could be exposed for up to one hour without suffering irreversible or debilitating health effects.   For flammable releases, the endpoint distance is that distance beyond which the community would be subject to a pressure wave of less than 1 psi resulting from the formation of an exploding vapor cloud.  Below this value little or no impact to the community is expected.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst case and alternative case scenarios in our facility Risk Management Plans.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in the worst case scenarios. However, chemical-specific steps that would likely be taken to prevent or mitigate the effects of each scenario are listed immediately following the scenario description.

According to EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\n\nNo passive mitigation measures were used in this analysis.\n\nThis worst case scenario does not allow credit to be taken for the following safety and prevention systems which are in place to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should it occur: \n\n7 Safety Relief Valve:  A pressure relief valve which relieves at excessive pressure to prevent a railcar overpressure and rupture.\n7 Department of Transportation / Federal Railroad Administration:  Requirements for special leak detection procedures and plugging of vents and drains to contain leaks or releases. \n7 Dedicated Railcars:  Railcars are dedicated for acrylontrile storage only.  This avoids cross-contamination with other chemical materials and ensures proper equipment setup (safety relief device sizing, specific gasket material, specific transfer line fittings, etc.)\n7 No Bottom Valves:  There are no bottom valves on the acrylonitrile railcars, and all transfers and unloading is done through a transfer line on the top of the railcar.  This prevents any leaks, drips, or releases from the bottom of the railcar and prevents spills during transfer or unloading operations. \n7 Cameras:  The acrylonitrile railcar is under surveillance by area cameras that are watched from a main control room.  This is in addition to the field surveillance.\n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors:  A water spray system that knocks down acrylonitrile vapors to limit"
