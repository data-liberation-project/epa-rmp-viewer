As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency responsiblilities have been instituted which include: emergency automatic shut-off's for each chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinder, an air scrubber system capable of handling a worst case scenario leak and a multi-sensor leak detection system with multiple alarms.  Additionally we have updated our operating and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Protective safety equipment including Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) has been placed in strategic areas and personnel are trained on its use.  An onsite emergency response plan, procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event that a local emergency response is needed has also been implemented.Lastly, an Evacuation Procedure with periodic drills has been implemented.\n\n   The Worst Case Release Scenario as described in this program is the release of the entire contents of a one-ton liquid chlorine or sulfur dioxide container in ten (10) minutes, or 200 lb/min.  For the worst case release scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec. and an atmospheric stability class \"F\" was used.  Using a combination of local data and an approved modeling program, the distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be .9 miles.\n\n   The Alternative Release Scenario as described in this program was based on a chlorine or sulfur dioxide container isolation valve stem failure.  A release rate of 0.16 lb/min., a wind speed of 3 meters/sec. and an atmospheric stability class ?D? was used.  This data when modeled produced no off-site impacts.\n\n   The dispersion modeling for both scenarios was conducted using Landview?6 and Marplot?3.31and site specific information.\n\n   No repor"
