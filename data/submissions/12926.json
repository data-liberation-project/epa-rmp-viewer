Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Montrose Elevator, Inc. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one- 30,000 gallon storage tank\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 127,500 pounds. \n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.4 miles.  \n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles where the maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds.  \n\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standard"

The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History.\t\t\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.\tEmergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has:\n\n\ta.\ta written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.\tprovided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc.\ta written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
