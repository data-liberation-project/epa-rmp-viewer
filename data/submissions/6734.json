The company employs nearly 13,400\npeople and manufactures its products in the United States, Brazil\nand the Czech Republic.  Other holdings include nearly 1.5\nmillion acres of forest and a real estate development business.\n\nToday, three of Westvaco's corporate divisions -- Forest\nResources, Kraft and Chemical -- are headquartered in Summerville\nand North Charleston.  Westvaco products manufactured in South\nCarolina are known as market leaders in domestic and export\nmarkets. Our paper mill in North Charleston manufactures\nunbleached paper used to make decorative laminates for surfaces\nlike kitchen countertops and office furniture.  Our high-strength\npaperboard is also used in the manufacture of a variety of\nfamiliar food containers and drink cartons.  In addition,\nWestvaco's lumber mill produces framing lumber and construction\ntimbers.\n\nEfficient use of all resources is a trademark of Westvaco\noperations.  Natural by-products of the papermaking process are\nthe raw materials for specialty chemical products manufactured by\nWestvaco at its North Charleston Chemical Division facilities.\nThese specialty chemical products set market standards around the\nglobe.  They are used in the manufacture of a variety of goods\nlike rubber and plastics, soaps, asphalt, textile dyes and\nprinting inks.\n\nWestvaco emphasizes product and service differentiation.  As part\nof the company=s strategy, we are also unequivocally committed to\ntotal compliance with environmental, safety and health\nregulations.\n\nWestvaco and Chlorine\nWestvaco uses chlorine in 90-ton rail cars to treat water before\nit is used in the papermaking process, and to control filamentous\nbacteria growth in an industrial waste treatment plant.  Prior to\nuse, the chlorine rail cars are staged on a separate track\nreferred to as the Haz-Mat track.\nAt low concentrations chlorine is commonly used to make solvents,\ndisinfectant"

When we handle chlorine, we make every\neffort to safeguard people and the environment.

First and\nforemost, our goal in any chemical incident is to contain any\nrelease as quickly as possible and to minimize the impact on the\nfacility and its neighbors.  If an incident occurs:\n<    Automatic safety valves close quickly to seal off chlorine\n     supply;\n<    Plant alarms will sound, the emergency communicated to all\n     site personnel over the mill-wide alert system and emergency\n     response teams will be activated;\n<    Westvaco Environmental Services personnel will be alerted,\n     and if necessary, perform computer modeling to estimate area\n     affected by release; and\n<    North Charleston Fire Department will activate local and\n     county response teams if needed.\n\nTraining and Preparation\nWe train employees on safe handling of chlorine and prepare to\nrespond appropriately to incidents should they occur.
