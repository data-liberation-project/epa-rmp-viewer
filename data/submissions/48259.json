The facility manufactures the refrigerant gas 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (KLEA 134a).  The facility has been in operation since December 1992 and currently employes 71 people (including contract workers).  Although KLEA 134a is the primary product, the facility also produces hydrochloric acid as a process by-product.\n\nKLEA 134a is the ozone friendly replacement refrigerant for CFC12.  It is used in automotive air conditioners, refrigerators, freezers, appliances (both home and commercial), and has many other consumer uses.  It is also purified to a medical-grade for use as a propellant in inhalers.\n\nUnder EPA's RMP rule, 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (KLEA 134a) is not regulated.  However, hydrogen fluoride (a raw material used in the process) and hydrochloric acid (a process by-product) are both regulated under the rule.  Flammable chemicals are not present at the INEOS Fluor facility in quantities regulated under the RMP rule.\n\nThis RMP involves predictive filing for hydrochloric acid.  The facility produces 36% nominal strength hydrochloric acid.  However, it has the capability to produce hydrochloric acid at strengths up to 38%.  Since the threshold concentration for hydrochloric acid in the RMP rule is 37% and the facility is capable of producing acid at strengths up to 38%, the predictive filing option is used for 38% hydrochloric acid.\n\nThe quantities of hydrogen fluoride and hydrochloric acid (conc. 37% or greater) provided in Section 1.17.c.3 include not only the maximum quantity found in the manufacturing process, but also the maximum quantity found in railcars located on-site.  Only a small fraction of that shown is in the manufacturing process and of that a significant fraction is in storage (i.e., the bulk of the quantities provided are in storage either in storage tanks or in railcars)"

Emergency response drills are held periodically to insure that responders are proficient in the use of mitigation systems and that notification procedures are followed.  The facility works with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Iberville Parish Community Awareness and Emergency Response Group to maintain and enhance emergency notification systems such as the Community Alert Notification (CAN) system.
