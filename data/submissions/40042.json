All other processes are subject to Program 2. The aqueous ammonia process is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard, therefore the process is subject to Program 2.\n\n 4.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate Risk Management Plans, the EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions, which are to be used as administrative guides for planning purposes. In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-case analyses. For that reason, the standardized worse-cases defined by EPA and an alternative case which is believed by the facility to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility, have been modeled. In accordance with changes to the Risk Management Plan requirements promulgated in April 2004, specific information about the off-site consequence assessment is provided only in the Data Elements of the Risk Management Plan.\n4.1 WORST-CASE\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from the largest single vessel.

In accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions. Unlike the worst-case release, alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\nThe OCLP facility performed a thorough review of the aqueous ammonia process utilizing engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records, in order to identify potential alternative release scenarios. Each identified alternative release scenario was evaluated to determine the potential for to affect offsite public receptors.  Based on this analysis, a representative alternative release was modeled and included in the Data Elements. \n5.0  ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe elements of the Program 2 Prevention Program are safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, incident investigation, and compliance audits.

Onondaga Cogeneration is a cogeneration facility in Syracuse, New York that is subject to U.S. EPA regulations governing Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G. This RMP certifies that OCLP has instituted a Risk Management Program at the Syracuse, New York facility that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five-year accidental release history.  This RMP certifies that prevention and emergency response programs are in place so as to minimize risks to workers and the potentially affected public.\n\n 2.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n2.1 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES\nIt is the policy of OCLP management to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The objective of this program is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and, if a release were to occur, to minimize the potential impact to OCLP employees, the public and the environment.  \nThis objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. OCLP\u00bfs management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy. Further,"

At the OCLP facility, the Plant Manager has primary responsibility for implementing and ensuring compliance with the ARP Program. Other individual employees, including the Operations Manager and Maintenance Manager, will assist the Plant Manager with various aspects of the program as required.\n\n 3.0  PROCESSES AND SUBSTANCES SUBJECT TO 40 CFR 68\n3.1 FACILITY OVERVIEW\nThe OCLP facility is a combined-cycle cogeneration facility, which produces electric power for sale to the Niagara Mohawk Corporation and process steam to its host facility (Crucible Specialty Metals Products). The OCLP facility consists of two General Electric combustion turbines rated at 45 and 23 megawatts (MW) of electric output. Waste heat from the turbine exhaust gases is passed through a heat recovery steam generator to generate steam. Natural gas is the facility\u00bfs primary fuel, with No. 2 distillate oil used as a backup fuel. \nThe combustion turbine design includes Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for the control of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Emissions of carbon monoxide are controlled through the use of an oxidation catalyst in Turbine No. 1. Emissions of nitrogen oxides are controlled with a combination of water injection and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). Water injection is used to cool the flame temperature in Turbine Nos. 1 and 2 thus inhibiting the formation of \u00bfthermal NOx\u00bf. Nitrogen oxide emissions are further reduced through the application of SCR. SCR is a process which involves the post-combustion removal of nitrogen oxides from the combustion flue gas with a catalytic reactor. In the SCR process, aqueous ammonia, which is injected in"

The aqueous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored in an above ground tank with a maximum capacity of 18,000 gallons (40,554 pounds). The tank is surrounded by a dike of sufficient volume to completely contain and spill from the storage tank. A piping system (both above and below ground) is used to deliver the ammonia to the combustion turbines. Prior to injection into the combustion turbine exhaust gas stream, the aqueous ammonia is vaporized and injected as a gas. \n3.3 PROGRAM LEVEL IDENTIFICATION\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as \u00bfprograms\u00bf.  EPA recognizes that some regulated processes would not pose an off-site hazard in the event of an accidental release.  Such processes are classified as Program 1.  Program 1 is applicable to any process for which it can be demonstrated that the public would not be adversely affected by a release. Thus, to qualify for Program 1, a facility with a regulated toxic chemical needs to meet two criteria.  \n? no release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted in off-site injury or environmental damage; and \n? dispersion modeling demonstrates that a worst-case release (as defined by the regulation) will not result in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the toxic endpoint.\nThe OCLP facility has not had an accident or release involving the aqueous ammonia during the history of the facility. However, the worst-case release, as defined by the regulation, results in concentrations at public receptors just beyond the facil"
