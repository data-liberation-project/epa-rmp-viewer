This plant utilizes holding ponds, digester, and a clarifier in cleaning waste water for ultimate discharge into the Yazoo River.  The plant currently has an emergency response plan prepared by Victor L. Stokes and employees receive periodic safety training and procedures for responding to an emergency release.  At any one time there can be as many as twelve - 2,000 lb. steel cylinders containing chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the waste water treatment process to purify the effluent before discharge.  Chlorine in the cylinder is compressed to a liquid state and when discharged through a regulator into the effluent stream becomes gas and is absorbed into the water sterilization.  The CASE# for chlorine is 7782-50-6.  The regulated level for chlorine Is 2,500 lbs.; therefore this facility must have a risk management plan.   \n\n\n\nThis facility implements an accident release prevention program.  This program includes safety training and operating procedures to respond to any release.  Handling cylinders so that no full cylinder will be moved over another full cylinder, therefore greatly minimizing the worse case scenario of two cylinders impacting with both rupturing.  Also the lift height for chlorine filled cylinders is reduced to less than a foot, further minimizing the chance of a release.  The alternate release scenario of a minor release (1-2 lbs.), when changing valves on cylinders, can be c"
