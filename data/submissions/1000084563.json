Nearly all individuals (including sensitive persons such as people with asthma) could be exposed to the EPA limit for up to one hour without irreversible or other serious health effects.  For flammables, the worst-case endpoint is a blast overpressure of one pound per square inch, which could cause partial collapse of houses and shattering of glass. The more realistic endpoint is the distance to the lower flammability limit (LFL), which is the lowest level at which a fire could burn.\r\n\r\nENOREE ACTIONS TO MINIMIZE HAZARD IMPACT\r\nMany factors can affect the hazard distance. At Enoree, in addition to our Prevention Program and Emergency Response Program, we have taken the following steps to minimize the hazard distance.\r\n\r\nSpill Containment - our vinyl acetate tank is diked such that if a spill occurs, even a total rupture, the contents will stay inside the dike.  This greatly reduces the potential impact distance.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity - avoiding a spill in the first place is the best way to minimize the hazard distance. \r\n\r\nTank Location - The tanks and unloading areas are generally situated away from the main process areas and property boundary, such that if an accident were to occur the area of highest impact would be generally away from employees and the public.\r\n\r\nOTHER ENOREE ACTIONS\r\nThe Enoree plant is an active participant in the Responsible Care&reg; program.  Responsible Care&reg; consists of 10 Guiding Principles and 6 Codes of Management Practices.  The Enoree facility follows many requirements of the EPA program under Responsible Care&reg;.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important to stress that we are proactive in our efforts to prevent any incident from occurring. We are required to report this information by law. However, every"

      "SummaryText": "Celanese Emulsions makes adhesive products that are used in a variety of materials, including paper, packing materials, carpets, and even building products. The manufacture of these materials dictates that certain chemicals be used.  Some of these chemicals are required to be addressed in the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), discussed below.\r\n\r\nThe RMP program has three parts listed below.\r\n\r\n1. Prevention Program (how to avoid accidents)\r\n2. Emergency Response Program (how to handle an accident)\r\n3. Hazard Assessment (what area might be impacted in an accident)\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS FOR ENOREE\r\nRMP regulations apply to Ethylene (flammable) and Vinyl Acetate (toxic) at the Enoree facility. \r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Prevention Program is the first line of defense against accidents.  The Prevention Program under RMP is essentially identical to that required by PSM. Thus, Enoree has already been complying with this portion of RMP even before the RMP regulation went into effect.\r\n\r\nAs implied by the name, the Prevention Program tries to avoid accidents.  The Prevention Program consists of the following components and applies to the chemicals listed above.\r\n\r\n1. Process Safety Information - maintaining physical details about the chemical processes such as toxicity and reactivity data, hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing, consequences of a deviation, process chemistry, design codes, and safety systems.\r\n2. Process Hazard Analysis - Enoree uses HAZOP, and fault tree methods for performing Process Hazard Analyses.  The method covers hazards of the process, identification of potential accidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of controls, siting, and human factors, and includes a qualitative evaluation of the health and safety impacts of control failure. At least one operator and one maintenance employee participate fully in the analyses.\r\n3. Operating Procedures - specific instructions for the operators that includes information on star"

Training - A comprehensive operations training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent and familiar with the operating procedures associated with the processes. A system is in place so that all required training is conducted in a timely manner.  This includes new employee training and refresher training.\r\n5. Mechanical Integrity - applies to pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. \r\n6. Management of Change - A written policy exists to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification. \r\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review - when a change is big enough to change safety information during the Management of Change audit, a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is required. Enoree also may require these even when not required by law. The PSSR confirms that the requirements specified by the MOC process are met.  An operator and maintenance employee are included in the PSSR.\r\n8. Compliance Audits - Audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being complied with.\r\n9. Incident Investigation - Incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release\r\nof a regulated substance are investigated to determine if changes to equipment or operating practices are needed to prevent future accidents.\r\n10. Employee Participation - Enoree employees routinely participate in process hazard analyses, operating procedures updates, department inspections, incident investigations, safe work permit procedure updates, emergency drills, etc.\r\n11. Hot Work Permit - permits are issued for work"

Contractors - Enoree has a contractor evaluation program in place to ensure that contractors meet safety requirements before working at Enoree. Additionally, all contractors receive plant-specific training before starting work onsite.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nIn the event of an accident, an emergency response program minimizes the potential impact.  Enoree has internal response teams trained to handle many potential events and coordinates with local fire departments for backup or certain types of response.\r\n\r\nEnoree has an onsite hazardous materials (HazMat) response team, and each member has completed, at a minimum, the 40-hr technician training. Additionally, Enoree has an onsite medical response team (First Responders) and a confined-space rescue team.\r\n\r\nEnoree relies on the local fire departments for fire support and uses the Spartanburg County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) for backup for all events.  Enoree coordinates responses with the community responders through twice-yearly site drills.  Enoree is an active sponsor of both Enoree Fire and Rescue and the town of Woodruff fire department.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nEPA requires that Enoree estimate the potential impact zone for accidents involving the regulated chemicals. A computer model is used to estimate the potential impact distance.\r\n\r\nEPA requires that two cases be evaluated:  a worst-case and a more realistic case (i.e. alternative case). The worst-case is highly improbable. It involves the combination of a certain set of weather conditions with a release of the entire contents of the largest container of chemical with no intervention by plant employees. The weather conditions result in the vapor plume from the release staying very concentrated and narrow. The more realistic case uses typical weather conditions for the site (e.g., partly cl"
