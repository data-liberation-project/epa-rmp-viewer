(IFF) is committed to providing each employee and the citizens of the surrounding community with a safe working and living environment. It is IFF's policy to conduct chemical manufacturing operations in a safe and environmentally sound manner. IFF has the expertise, experience and training to handle the materials used at the Jacksonville facility in a safe and environmentally sound manner. In the event of an incident at the facility or involving our materials, IFF is committed and prepared to properly respond so that life and property are protected to the greatest extent possible.\n\nIFF processes turpentine at the Jacksonville facility and converts it to various terpene and synthetic aroma chemicals. Several hazardous substances are used in IFF's processes, but IFF has only one substance in a \"covered process\"  subject to the US Environmental Protection Agency's  Accidental Release Rule(under Program 3), due to its potential for off-site consequences in the unlikely event of a major release. This substance is Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride (AHCL).\n\nAHCL vapor is highly irritating to breathe and moderately toxic. A sufficiently high dose can be fatal. In the event of a release, concentrated vapor can be recognized by its dense, white plume. Its sharp, pungent odor can be detected in very low concentrations. Anyone exposed to a release should avoid the vapor plume if possible or take shelter inside a building until the plume passes, which would be a matter of minutes under typical weather conditions. Sheltering-in-place involves entering an enclosed building, immediately closing windows and doors, turning off all ventilating or air conditioning systems, turning on the radio or TV for emergency bulletins and staying calm until it is announced that the emergency is over.\n\nIFF has always recognized its responsibility to manage AHCL safely and to be able to respond to an accidental release.

      "SummaryText": "ncy Response Plan has been in place for more than two decades and is kept up to date. Facility personnel are trained in their appropriate level of emergency response and retrained annually, in accordance with formal procedures and OSHA's \"HAZWOPER\" rule (29 CFR 1910.120). Drills are conducted quarterly.Recent walk-throughs of the HCl system involve the participation of the city's Hazardous Materials Response Team and Fire and Rescue Units. Jacksonville's Emergency Preparedness Division, Fire and Rescue Department, would be notified immediately in the event of a major release and would be responsible for conducting off-site response activities.\n\nIncidents and near misses are required to be thoroughly investigated to learn what can be done to further improve the safety of IFF's systems and procedures. IFF is always actively seeking to improve safety and reduce risk to its employees and the surrounding community."
