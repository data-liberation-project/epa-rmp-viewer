      "SummaryText": "1) Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nPlaquemine Methocel seeks to evaluate, understand, manage, control, and eliminate process hazards associated with manufacturing operations to protect people, our community, and the environment.  We continuously improve our knowledge of process technology and learn from hazardous events in similar industries.  Multiple layers of protection involving engineering controls, administrative controls, and inter-related management systems work together to eliminate hazards and reduce risk. In addition, key components of our program include leveraging knowledge, maintaining strong operational discipline, reviewing metrics, measuring performance, auditing programs, updating documents, partnering with local chemical manufacturers via the Iberville Community Awareness Emergency Response (ICAER) organization, and actively participating in the Iberville Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n2) Facility description and regulated substances handled:\n\nPlaquemine Methocel is situated inside of the Dow Louisiana Operations (LAO) Industrial Park (iPark) in Plaquemine, Louisiana.  The Dow LAO site is a global-scale petrochemical complex.  It has been in continuous operation since 1956.  For over 60 years, Dow referred to the facility as the Cellulose Plant.  Historically, Dow included the Cellulose Plant in the site-wide Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission.\n\nPrior to April 1st, 2019, the facility was owned and operated by The Dow Chemical Company.  A separate RMP was submitted when it became a standalone DuPont site in Block 45 of the larger LAO complex.  Then, Plaquemine Methocel became a standalone IFF site on February 1st, 2021.  IFF sold the facility to Roquette.  The transaction is scheduled to close 2025.\n\nMETHOCEL (trademark) is a tradename for Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC).  Our facility makes various grades of HPMC, which is a white powder with many uses.  It is a water-soluble ether made f"

HPMC is used as an emulsifier, film former, protective colloid, stabilizer, suspending agent, or thickener in food and drug applications.  It also has industrial applications.  For example, HPMC is used to manufacture catalytic converters.\n\nEPA RMP regulated substances used to manufacture HPMC:  Methyl Chloride, Methyl Ether, Hydrogen Chloride (anhydrous), and Propylene Oxide.\n\n3) General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nOur facility is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  And, while METHOCEL (trademark) is not toxic or corrosive, it is a combustible dust.  Accordingly, it has a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) as required by the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard.\nNote the various prevention program elements and steps below.\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Maintain detailed records of safety information such as chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design for each covered process.  This includes SDSs for chemicals, equipment specification sheets, and reactive chemical information.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Conduct comprehensive studies to ensure process hazards are identified and controlled at regular intervals and when prompted by operational changes.  Methodologies used to conduct these analyses include What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, LOPA, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis.  Studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Covered processes are governed by written standard operating procedures (SOPs).  These SOPs address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  SOPs are regularly reviewed and periodically updated.  And, SOPs are readily accessible to personnel involved in process"

New employees are provided classroom training and computer-based training.  And, all new employees receive on-the-job mentoring and field training. Refresher training is provided periodically and as needed.  Near misses logs and audit findings may be used to develop training material.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Routine and periodic maintenance checks are performed to ensure proper operations and to minimize/prevent incidents resulting from mechanical failures or equipment breakdowns.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, process instrumentation and controls and pumps.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC):  An electronic MOC tool is used to document and manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes.  The MOC process also helps ensure personnel are provided training to safety adapt or transition to modifications.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:  Conduct Pre-start up safety reviews related to new, modified, and established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Conduct audits on a regular basis to verify the provisions and requirements of the RMP rule are complied with.  Audits on covered processes are carried out at least every three years.  Corrective actions are identified and tracked to completion.  Auditors also generate opportunities for improvement (OFIs).\n\nIncident Investigation:  Teams investigate incidents that have resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a cata"

Process safety management and chemical accident prevention require a consistent and coordinated effort of the entire team.  Employees, contractors, and visitors are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention and to recommend improvements.  Stop Work Authority is promoted.  And, an anonymous reporting mechanism exists.\n\nContractors:  Contractors conduct specialized maintenance, construction, and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, the contractor's safety performance is evaluated.  Contractors are informed of hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors must declare hazards they introduce.\n\n4)\tFive-year accident history:  None.\n\n5)\tEmergency response program:\n\nAn Immediate Response Leader (IRL) is assigned to each shift.
