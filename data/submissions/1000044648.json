Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of Safeway, Inc. - Santa Fe Springs DC to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Safeway, Inc. - Santa Fe Springs DC implements this policy toward chemical and general safety through ongoing employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  \n\n\n\nSafeway, Inc. - Santa Fe Springs DC's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Safeway has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Safeway, Inc. - Santa Fe Springs DC was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulatio"

The facility is located at 12801 Excelsior Drive in Santa Fe Springs, California. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 24,500 pounds of ammonia within a closed system for the purpose of dock and cold storage operations.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage.\n\n\n\nThe facility is approximately 0.1 miles west of the Interstate 5 Freeway.  The facility currently covers approximately 86 acres and was originally built in 1961. Since then, several additions have been built on to the facility: the west produce warehouse in 1967, the frozen foods warehouse in 1969, the east produce warehouse in 1977, and the compressor room in 1987. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas. The facility is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR Publication R 1, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nIn addition, Safeway, Inc. - Santa Fe Springs DC prepared and implemented a PSM program in June 1995.  This included conducting an initial PHA to examine potential release scenarios and identify measures to reduce the consequences and/or likelihood of such events.  The PHA has been reva"

The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Employee Training, and Participation, etc.) \n\n\n\nEngineering Measures\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system employed by the Safeway, Inc. - Santa Fe Springs DC is equipped with a computer which monitors the system and controls the cooling towers. The computer system is connected to controls and status indicators throughout the refrigeration system intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations. This monitoring system is comprised of liquid level controls, pressure and temperature controls and indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing the computer (or facility operators) to effectively monitor and control refrigeration operations. \n\n\n\nThe system is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by refrigeration operators. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis (March 11, 2014), revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (March 2009 - March 2014). \n\n\n\nHowever the facility did have one release on 5/25/2009 that met the above definition.

The operator was injured, sent to the hospital, and later released. The fire department (CUPA) was notified and responded to the release. It was determined that only 3 pounds of ammonia was released. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Safeway, Inc. - Santa Fe Springs DC has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document and in the Business Plan for the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.  To save lives.\n\n2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.  To protect the environment.\n\n4.  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly areas, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  If a release of ammonia were to occur, the facility will determine the extent of the emergency.   Supervisors will contact employees in their department to shut off equipment and evacuate to the designated meeting areas.  The public address system and blow horns will be used in the event that individual contact cannot be made.  Plant management will call 911 in order to reach the City of Santa Fe Springs Department of Fire and Rescue who will respond to the ammonia release.  All employees are trained annually in the emergency evacuation/response plan.
