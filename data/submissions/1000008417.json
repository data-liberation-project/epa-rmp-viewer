Frederick Street facility is the main office and plant.  This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. The following hazardous chemicals subject to PSM are stored on site:  Anhydrous Ammonia, Formaldehyde, Hydrogen Chloride (stored as aqueous Hydrochloric Acid), and Hydrogen Fluoride (aqueous Hydrofluoric Acid)  Chemicals subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements are Hydrofluoric Acid 70%, and Ammonia (conc 20% or greater). Anhydrous ammonia was reported in 1999; however inventory of this material had been reduced below the threshold quantity and has remained below the threshold quantity.\n\nThe facility's prevention program includes implementation of procedures to address employee safety and to reduce risk of accidents involving hazardous chemicals.  An area that has secondary containment and a neutralization tank is utilized to capture, contain and neutralize spills.  This program has been successful in that there have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.  The facility also has a written emergency response plan that includes specific actions to be taken in the event of a spill.  Employees receive regular training in both the prevention program and the emergency response plan.  The facility seeks to improve safety by regular review of its safety policies and performance."
