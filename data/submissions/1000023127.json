      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.0   Introduction\n\nINEOS O&P USA is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, INEOS has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at INEOS and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a summary of the risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at INEOS.  This plan summary is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 though 40 CFR 68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management plan in place at INEOS.\n\n\n\n2.0   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nINEOS is committed to the welfare of their employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment.  INEOS implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, INEOS will conduct emergency response actions to help prevent or minimize injury to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n3.0   Facility Process and Regulated Substances\n\nINEOS manufactures polypropylene resins for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications such as plastic bottles, chip bags, children's toys, and car parts.\n\n  \n\nThe manufacturing process uses propylene as the basic building block for producing polypropylene. Propane is inherent to polypropylene processes.  \n\n\n\n4.0   Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on the polypropylene facility.  The subject analysis consisted of worst-case scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s).\n\n\n\nOne worst-case scenario was completed for fl"

The pressure effects from this scenario could reach the offsite industrial endpoints is not predicted to reach residential populations.\n\n\n\nEach worst-case scenario is considered a conservative analysis.  These scenarios are based on stable conditions and low wind speed.  In addition, the worst-case scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation activities.\n\n\n\nTwo ARS were completed for flammable RMP compounds.  The first scenario is a propylene release from the PP metering yard due to a piping failure, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The second scenario is a vapor cloud fire from release of propylene also from the PP metering yard due to a piping failure.  The pressure / thermal effects from these scenarios may reach the offsite industrial endpoints but are not predicted to reach residential populations.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenarios are based on the most common weather conditions.  It should be noted that these scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation activities other than emergency response.\n\n\n\n5.0   Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe polypropylene process is currently covered by the PSM standard.  As such, a Program Level 3 prevention program is in place.  The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at INEOS.\n\n\n\n5.1   Safety Information \n\nINEOS maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the polypropylene processes.  We review communicate and maintain Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable"

Checklists include items to help ensure that INEOS operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n5.3   Operating Procedures \n\nINEOS maintains its operating procedures under an ISO9001 and OSHA PSM/VPP programs.  As such we are required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n\n\n5.4   Training \n\nINEOS trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\n\n\n5.5   Maintenance \n\nINEOS properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\n\n\n5.6   Management of Change \n\nINEOS has a program in place to document changes to the process.  A significant change in process chemicals, technology, equipment, practices or procedures prompt implementation of this program.  The program is designed to (1) evaluate the impact of the change on the process, (2) update records on the process and (3) ensure that workers are informed and trained on any significant changes.\n\n\n\n5.7   Pre-startup Review \n\nINEOS performs audits on a new process or an existing process that has undergone a modification affecting the safety information.  This review is "
