THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT WOULD BE 1.02 MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 2000 AREA RESIDENTS. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE WOULD HAVE A RUPTURE OF A TRANSFER HOSE, RELEASING 11,908 POUNDS AND HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .41 MILES AFFECTING NEARLY 1000 CITIZENS.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF ANSI K-61, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 AS WELL AS THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULUTRE. THE STATE INSPECTS OUR PLANT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT. OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS IN GENERAL SAFETY, THE HAZARDS OF AMMONIA, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES OF A TYPICAL FACILITY. THE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES AND GOGGLES DURING LOADING OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ON HAND DURING NURSE TANK FILLING OPERATIONS. WITH THIS IN MIND, IT'S ESPECIALLY EASY TO REPORT THAT NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES HAVE OCCURED AT THIS LOCATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHIS FACILITY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN AND HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY INCIDENT.\n\nTHE OTTAWA COOP IS COMMITTED TO SAFETY. WE REQUIRE THAT EACH EMPLOYEE THAT LOADS AMMONIA BE TRAINED EVERY THREE YEARS AT A STATE SPONSERED TRAINING SCHOOL AND YEARLY TRAINED IN OPERATING AND SAFETY PROCEEDURES AT A GIVEN AMMONIA PLANT. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO INSPECT THE AMMONIA PLANT BEFORE FILLING PROCEEDURES AND BEFORE USE DO A VISUAL INSPECTION OF ALL HOSES AND VALVES TO MAKE SURE THERE HAS NO"
