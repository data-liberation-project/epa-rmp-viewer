A regulated chlorine process is no longer present at the facility and, therefore, is not included in this documentation.\n\nFoster Poultry Farms, Foster Turkey Processing Plant 2 (referred to hereafter as \"Foster Farms\" or \"FTP 2\") prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations.  The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both CalOSHA and OSHA regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Many state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications.

In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to mitigate the release.  Foster Farms will rely on community responders for medical assistance and public evacuation or protection in place, if necessary.  \n\nFTP 2 is located at 711 F Street in Turlock, California.  The facility was constructed in 1978 and purchased by Foster Farms from the Grange Company in 1982.  Operations at the facility consist of further processing, fabrication, and packaging of poultry deli products.  The facilities are located on approximately two acres bordered by 8th Street to the west, Americold cold storage to the east, Valley Fresh Inc. to the north, and F Street to the south.  The properties surrounding the facility have industrial businesses to the east and north and residences to the south and west of the facility.  The Foster Farms facility is surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access.  Additionally, the entrance to the facility is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system at the facility.  The system provides cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, and water chilling.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  Ammonia is used as the heat transfer media in the refrigeration system.  As the ammonia passes through heat exchangers in the various refrigerated areas or units, heat is transferred to the ammonia thus cooling the air, water, or product that is giving up heat.  The ammonia is then compressed and passes through a condenser wh"

Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used industrial refrigerant due to its relatively efficient heat transfer characteristics.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Foster Farms knows of no reportable releases at the facility within the required reporting period.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Foster Farms facility due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"\u00bfthe greatest amount held in a single vessel\u00bfreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThe largest ammonia vessel at Foster Farms, the high-pressure receiver, contains approximately 30,000 pounds of ammonia at 80% capacity -- the safe fill level for the vessel.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of 30,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the high-pressure receiver is required for this scenario to occur.  As required by the RMP regulations, pessimistic atmospheric conditions, very conservative chemical dispersion characteristics, and a toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm) ammonia vapor were assumed.  The SLAB Model was used for modeling the worst-case release scenario.  SLAB was first developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.

SLAB is commonly used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases. \n\nFoster Farms used the alternative release scenario described in the EPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998.  The release scenario is described as a \u00bc-inch effective diameter orifice leaking liquid ammonia and resulting in an airborne release, representative of a pipe connection leak or a gasket rupture.  The evaluation used a release rate of 78.8 pounds/minute and average weather conditions. The SLAB Model was used also for modeling the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.\n\nThe predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in all of the systems at FTP 2 are connected to a diffusion panel.  Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) and discharged to the sewer system to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels.  Further, all pressure vessels in all the systems are equipped with pressure relief valves. \n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility include: \n\u00b7 Emergency shutdown systems\n\u00b7 Component specific safety shutdowns\n\u00b7 Ammonia leak detection system installed in engine room and some production areas\n\u00b7 A solenoid operated king shut off valve activated by the ammonia detection system is being installed as part of the 2000 r"
