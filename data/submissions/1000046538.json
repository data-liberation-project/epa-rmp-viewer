      "SummaryText": "The Cooperative Gin Company accepts delivery of Anhydrous Ammonia by truck and immediately offloads the ammonia to our temporary storage tanks.  It is then moved to nurse tanks to be used by local farmers in the local farming operations.  When the facility was constructed, high volume lockout valves, locking tank valves, and other safety devices were put into the system to minimize a release during our filling operations.  All employees are trained and facilities are inspected on a continous basis.  The local fire department has been familiarized with ammonia spill mitigation and how to operate all emergency shutoffs.  Nurse tanks are not left full of ammonia on site.  Nurse tanks are filled and picked up by cutomers on a as needed basis.  We have had many episodes of attempted theft of Anhydrous Ammonia for illegal drug manufacturing activities.  Our local police have been involved in several servalance and sting operations to minimize this risk and have had some success.  Our business is small and sessonal and is located in a very sparcely populated part of town.  Our plan involves all emergency response teams in our area and we continually coordinate with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective Feb. 2012 we sold out all Anhydrous Ammonia tanks, trailers and equipment.  We no longer have any on our property and are not\n\ninvolved in the sales or distribution of this chemical..\n\n\n\nThank You\n\nJeannie Cunningham\n\n"
