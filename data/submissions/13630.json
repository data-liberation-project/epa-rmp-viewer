Hazard Determination\n\nCentral Erie Supply & Elevator Ass'n will rely on the Chemical Manufacturer's Material Safty Data Sheets (MSDS) for the Hazard Determination.\n\n2.  Container Labeling\n\nChemical Manufacturer's Labeling System will be used at Central Erie Supply & Elevator Ass'n. \nThe Dock Unloading Supervisor will verify that containers received will:\nBe clearly labled as to the contents\nNote the appropriate hazard warning(s)\nState target organ(s)\nList the name and address of the manufacturer\nIt is the policy of the company that no container will be released for use until the above data is verified.  \nThe supervisor in each department will ensure that all secondary containers are properly labled and that all labels are legible. \n\n3.  Material Safty Data Sheets (MSDS)\n\nCopies of MSDSs for all hazardous chemicals to which employees of this company may be exposed are kept in the following location: At counter in the Main Office\n\nIt will be the responsibility of the Office Manager to maintain, update and distribute MSDSs.\n\nNo new product of a hazardous nature will be accepted in the workplace without an MSDS on file or accompanying the shipment.\n\nManuracturers or distributors failing to provide MSDSs will be considered as failing to meet contractual requirements.  This statement shall appear on purchase order or/offers to bid.  The purchasing department shall monitor this.\n\nMSDSs are required prior to any hazardous material(s) being introduced into our facility by contractors, vendors, sales-people, frequenters or our employees.\n\n4.

The Facility Policy\nThe management and employees of Central Erie Supply & Elevator Ass'n are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, Central Erie is prepared to work with local fire departments or other authories to mitagate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons or enviroment.\n\nII.  Facility Information\nThe primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers to the farmers of the area.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and sold to farmers, as a crop production nutrient.\nThe maximum amount that could be stored is 200,000 pounds and that is considering both a 30,000 and a 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quanity handled at any one time, would be the unloading of a semi-tanker, containing 24,000 pounds.\nIII.

The endpoint from release would be 1.73 miles.\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersons to 200 ppm would be .68 miles.\n\nIV.  Accidental release prevention program\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safty Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\nV.  Five-year Accident History\nThere has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\nVI.  Emergency responce program\nThe facility has an emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.  Also the facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\nVII.  Planned changes to improve safty\nSafty is a on-going process at our plant.  Evaluations are made daily and are assessed to make sure of the maintance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia recommendations for safety to be implemented at this time."
