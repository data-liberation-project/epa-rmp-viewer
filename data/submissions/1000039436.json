Equipment integrity is maintained by following proper design, fabrication, and installation, and maintenance practices and design codes.  Solid, well written operating procedures and training programs for personnel in the facility are used to prevent process upsets and equipment damage.   Continuous monitoring of the facility's processes is accomplished by both process operators and computer control to operate within equipment and process limitation.  Advisory alarms and emergency shutdown systems are designed and tested to automatically limit the potential for a release.  Incident investigations are used to learn the cause of both near misses and incidents so those corrective action steps may be implemented to prevent the future incidents.\n\n\n\nFollowing is a partial listing of chemical specific programs in the facility to prevent releases.   The use of portable ammonia specific detection equipment to detect and repair minor leaks in the facility.   Continuous monitoring of ammonia rail car unloading and truck loading by video cameras and personnel.  Spare ammonia refrigeration compressors capacity.
