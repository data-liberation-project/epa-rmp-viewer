      "SummaryText": "HUNTSMAN CONROE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies - Huntsman Conroe Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally responsible work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Conroe Site Plant having earned and maintained its ranking as an Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Star site for excellence in safety performance.  The Huntsman Conroe Site maintains a working Process Safety Management(PSM) program that implements a series of steps to control potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with on-site procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Conroe Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in September 1992, the Conroe Site Plant has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances - Huntsman's Conroe Site Plant is located approximately five miles east of Conroe, Texas.  The Site Plant is 476 acres, of which 100 acres have been developed.  The Conroe Site takes raw materials and uses batch or continuous operations to produce useful chemicals which other companies then process into cosmetics, epoxy coatings and other consumer products.  Huntsman's Conroe Site Plant has 9 regulated substances at the facility.    \n\nThree flammable substances are:\n? Dimethylamine (DMA) - Used in hair products, gasoline additives, as antistatic agents, fabric softeners and dyes.\n? Hydrogen - Used to produce fuel additives and epoxy curing agents.\n? Monomethylamine (MMA) - Used in gas treating of refinery and natural gas streams and as a textile softener.\nSix toxic substances are:\n? Acrylonitrile - Used in making floor waxes, water treating chemicals and agricultural chemicals.\n? Amm"

Propylene Oxide (PO) - Used in making non-toxic solvents and in food preservation.\n \n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis  \nOffsite consequence analyses have been performed as required by 40 CFR 68.  These analyses are detailed in the registration section of this submission.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. \nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Conroe Site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\n? Process Safety Information\n Huntsman's Conroe Site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n? Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n? The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n? Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n \n? Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n Huntsman's Conroe Site Plant has performed a process hazard analysis on each process to identify the potenti"
