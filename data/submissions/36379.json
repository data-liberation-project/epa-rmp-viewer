Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies - Huntsman Conroe Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally responsible work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Conroe Site Plant having earned and maintained its ranking as an Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Star site for excellence in safety performance.  The Huntsman Conroe Site maintains a working Process Safety Management(PSM) program that implements a series of steps to control potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with on-site procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Conroe Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in September 1992, the Conroe Site Plant has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances - Huntsman's Conroe Site Plant is located approximately five miles east of Conroe, Texas.  The Site Plant is 476 acres, of which 100 acres have been developed.  The Conroe Site takes raw materials and uses batch or continuous operations to produce useful chemicals which other companies then process into cosmetics, epoxy coatings and other consumer products.  Huntsman's Conroe Site Plant has 9 regulated substances at the facility.\t\n\nThree flammable substances are:\n\u00b7 Dimethylamine (DMA) - Used in hair products, gasoline additives, as antistatic agents, fabric softeners and dyes.\n\u00b7 Hydrogen - Used to produce fuel additives and epoxy curing agents.\n\u00b7 Monomethylamine (MMA) - Used in gas treating of refinery and natural gas streams and as a textile softener.\nSix toxic substances are:\n\u00b7 Acrylonitrile - Used in making floor waxes, water treating chemicals and agricultural chemicals.\n\u00b7 Amm"

The PHAs also addressed consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility or stationary source siting, human factors and a qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. and the ways to minimize those hazards.  The Conroe Site utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Conroe Site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. The Huntsman Conroe Plant completes a PHA Revalidation for each covered process every 5-years meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards. \n \n\u00b7 Operating Procedures\n Huntsman Conroe Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and/or revised annually to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \n\u00b7 Training\n Huntsman Conroe Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.
