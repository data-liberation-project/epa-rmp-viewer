Medical emergencies will require notification to the local Emergency Management Services and Saint Catherine's Hospital.  This facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  Additional hazmat capabilities are provided by the East Chicago Fire Department and contracted services.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - East Chicago East Terminal is a bulk refined petroleum storage facility, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and three (3)  storage tanks.\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's largest tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed by the system (99%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate release scenario is a BLEVE.  This alternate scenario was based on an incident (other than a catastrophic tank failure) which would result in the greatest released quantity (fire situation) and have the greatest potential for off-site consequences.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - East Chicago East Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Lake County LEPC.  The East Chicago Fire Department is anticipated to participate in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\nSafety improvements to implement by Buckeye Terminals, LLC include additional hazard communication signage and more readily recognizable demarcation of emergency shut-down devices.\n"
