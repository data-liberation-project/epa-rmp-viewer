Normally, this hydrogen gas is burned or vented to the atmosphere, but it is collected and transferred to our facility via pipeline.  In our production process, the hydrogen gas is cooled and compressed to remove moisture and other contaminants.  The hydrogen gas is then liquefied using liquid nitrogen, which Linde produces on-site.  The final cryogenic liquid hydrogen product is stored in our insulated storage tanks, and is shipped by truck to customers throughout the south.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \r\nHydrogen, which is purified, liquefied and stored on this site and then shipped out via cryogenic liquid transport. \r\n \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\n\r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible CareA&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the McIntosh AL facility has"

This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\r\n\r\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\r\n\r\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity. \r\n\r\n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review. \r\n\r\nLinde has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered process at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\r\n\r\nThe liquid hydrogen storage tanks are equipped with a remote isolation switch that can isolate the tanks in the event of a spill or release.  The tanks can be isolated from inside the control room or out in the plant operating area (two automatic valves, and one manual valve).  The tanks are also equipped with a dual relief system which includes bursting disc and pressure relief valves that discharge to a properly designed relief valve vent system.  The tanks also have an overfill protection system.  This system automatically isolat"

The pressure on the tanks is controlled by venting the gas to a hydrogen recovery system eliminating the venting of gas to the atmosphere.  There is an automatic water deluge system on the tanks and the truck fill zone.  The deluge system is flow tested annually.  Vacuum on the tanks is tested to ensure there are no internal leaks.  The process and fire systems are monitored by a computer control system.  The operation is manned 24/7.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe McIntosh Hydrogen facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Programs\r\n\r\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. \r\n\r\nFor other than minor incidents Linde has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Washington County LEPC and the McIntosh Volunteer Fire Department.  \r\n\r\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\r\n \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of Zero/Zero, which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\r\n\r\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
