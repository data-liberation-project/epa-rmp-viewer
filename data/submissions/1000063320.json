      "SummaryText": "The City of Eureka is committed to providing a safe and healthful workplace free from recognized hazards as well as minimizing, to the greatest extent practicable, the risks to the public and visitors.  This commitment is embodied in this Risk Management Program plan for the prevention of accidental releases of acutely hazardous materials, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas.  Risks are reduced by ensuring that recognized industry standards of process engineering and hazard mitigation are employed along with effective administrative procedures, including emergency response and employee training.\n\n\n\nThis plan focuses on preventing releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide gasses from the wastewater disinfection process.  The disinfection process involves the extraction of gaseous chlorine from 1-ton cylinders and the subsequent injection of a liquid solution of that chlorine into the wastewater effluent.  The process then involves the extraction of gaseous sulfur dioxide from 1-ton cylinders and the subsequent injection of a liquid solution of that sulfur dioxide into the chlorinated wastewater effluent for the purpose of de-chlorinating prior to discharge. The phase during which the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide gas is extracted and delivered to the liquid injectors via piping is the period during which and accidental release could potentially have offsite consequences, depending upon the extent of the release.\n\n\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant's Process Safety Management Plan, as well as standard operating procedures and preventative maintenance form the core of the accidental release prevention strategy.  These programs ensure that regular facility and equipment inspections, preventative servicing, and repairs are made in a timely manner.  This reduces the risk of equipment failure that could interrupt the disinfecting process and/or potentially lead to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  On-going employee training prepares employees to respond effec"

Additional steps implemented to reduce the risk of accidental release include cylinder inspection procedures and third-party observations and assessments of operating and response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe wastewater treatment industry has, overall, an excellent safety record for the storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Likewise, the City of Eureka Elk River Wastewater Treatment Plant has not had any releases that presented a serious health risk to individuals offsite.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program for the wastewater treatment plant emphasizes a rapid, defensive response to maintain employee safety and, if necessary, to quickly activate a response by the hazardous materials response team. The level of response by treatment plant personnel is limited to that which is possible without the use of self carried breathing apparatus.  Any major leak necessitating the use of supplied air respirators such as self-contained breathing apparatus requires the response of the Hazardous Materials Response Team.  The response procedures also include making the proper notifications to Humboldt County Environmental Health Division and other agencies.\n\n\n\nDuring development of the Process Safety Management plan and review of operating procedures in 1999, changes were implemented as a means to reduce the risk of an accidental release.  The use of a cylinder-receiving checklist now provides a procedure whereby full cylinders being delivered by the vendor can be checked to ensure that they are in compliance with federal hydrostatic testing requirements.  Hydrostatic testing is performed every 5 years (60 months) and is directly related to the structural integrity and strength of the cylinders.  Any cylinders which are either overdue for testing or could become overdue for testing while onsite are not accepted for delivery.  A spare regulator is now kept onsite as an emergency replacement unit, s"
