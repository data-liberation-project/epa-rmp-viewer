If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy that our onsite Fire and Hazardous Materials Response Personal respond initially to the emergency.  If it becomes necessary, coordination has been established with local Law Enforcement, Fire Department, and Hospital officials to respond and notify the public. \n\n\nDescription of this facility and the regulated substance handled at an amount above the threshold quantity:\n\nThis plant is a manufacturer of Propellants, Explosives, and Pyrotechnics.  Nitric Acid is used in one facility on this plant to produce energetic materials.  A quantity of 4,000 gal. of Nitric Acid is stored on site, and a 500-gal. quantity is used each time in the process.\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for this process:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of a 500-gallon reactor containing Nitric Acid at an elevated process temperature.  This process takes place in an enclosed building, which substantially reduces the emission rate of the Nitric Acid to the outside air.  Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case release scenario would not affect any public receptors.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.  Containment for the listed chemical, with a resistant coating is present.  This building is also designed to comply with the latest editions of NFPA fire codes, ASME codes, ASTM requirements, and OSHA requirements. A glass-lined tank and piping are also used in areas that come in contact with the Nitric Acid.\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThis manufacturing process has had no accidental relea"

      "SummaryText": "ses that have caused offsite impacts such as deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's Emergency Action Plan  (29 CFR 1910.38(a)), and Subpart D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements for a Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures For Spills of Hazardous Materials.  All initial response will be done by trained and on site Fire, and Hazardous Materials Response Personnel.  There is also a trained and skilled Medical Services Department on site during regular hours.  Coordination with local Fire Departments, Police Departments, and Hospitals has been completed in the event that their assistance might be required.  \n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nIt is this company's policy to protect ourselves, customers, facilities, and the surrounding communities by operating in a safe manner.   When deficiencies in safety are revealed, there is great emphasis to improve conditions in order to operate in a safe manner."
