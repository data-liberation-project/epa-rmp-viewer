      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at facility\n\nCorporate and facility management believes in safe and environmentally sound practices.  Dynamic Metal Forming's Risk Management Plan reflects that commitment.  The company's preventive maintenance and emergency response plans will minimize the chances for a spill occurring and insure quick response if a spill should occur.\n\n\nFacility and the regulated substances handled\n\nDynamic Metal Forming, Inc. (Dynamic Metal Forming) in Koppel, Pennsylvania is a specialty tube finishing plant that manufactures precision cold drawn metal tubing.  The facility cuts, draws, anneals, cleans, and otherwise processes semi-finished metal tube produced by other manufacturers.  The plant processes stainless steel, nonferrous alloys, and other types of metals.\n\nDuring the metal-cleaning step, bundles of tubes are carried by overhead crane and dipped into long dip tanks.  Dynamic Metal Forming uses hydrofluoric acid (HF) in solution with other chemicals as one of the cleaning agents.  Prior to mixing and dilution in the cleaning tank the raw hydrofluoric acid is stored at a 70% concentration.  Hydrofluoric Acid, a chemical mandated for listing by Congress under the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements of the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), meets its toxic chemical threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds at the plant.  It, therefore, must be included in a Risk Management Program for its respective operation.\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s):\n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis' (OCA) for the calculations for HF releases were analyzed using appropriate air dispersion analysis and modeling techniques.  In both scenarios \"worst-case\" wind and stability conditions were used to simulate poor dispersion of the HF, even though the 112(r) rule allows the use of more favorable dispersion conditions, such as increased wind speeds and a greater dilution factor, for the Alternative Rele"

The topography surrounding Dynamic Metal Forming's Koppel operations will frequently contribute to poor dispersion conditions, especially at night and through early morning.  Therefore, use of \"worst-case\" meteorology is prudent.\n\nAt the Dynamic Metal Forming facility, a potential HF release would be affected by both proximity to plant buildings and hilly terrain and by potential chemical reactions.  These conditions would tend to concentrate emissions close to the facility and lesson concentrations farther away.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nEquations were selected from U.S. Environment Protection Agency's RMP OCA Guide to perform the release calculations for the worst-case release scenario.\n\nA rupture of the HF storage tank and subsequent release of its complete contents was assumed.  In addition, because the location of the HF storage tank is near the edge of the containment dike, up to 50% was assumed to spread to a depth of one centimeter across the soil outside the dike.  With these assumptions, the pool size for this semi-unmitigated release\" was 15,000 square feet.  Evaporation from the spill was estimated to occur for at least two hours.  Using the EPA's RMPComp release dispersion modeling program the distance to the toxic endpoint for worst-case scenario would be 3.2 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nHGSYSTEM: Dispersion Models for Ideal Gases was used to perform the Offsite Consequence Analysis for the alternative release scenario.  HGSYSTEM can model the full chemistry and thermodynamics of HF.\n\nA release of the entire tank contents during a leak or partial failure of the HF storage tank (including potential welded seam or bottom flange failures or punctures) was assumed.  The release was assumed to be contained within the 4,960 square feet dike under the tank.  Evaporation from the spill was estimated to occur for more than six hours.  Using HGSYSTEM release dispersion modeling program the distance to the toxic endpoint f"

Employees and/or contractors routinely inspect the hydrofluoric acid storage system for mechanical integrity and safety.  In addition, Dynamic Metal Forming employees inspect the storage tank area for evidence of leaks, secondary containment system integrity, and safety/first aid equipment operation.\n\nAlso, the storage tank and piping system is constructed of only materials compatible with 70% hydrofluoric acid.  \n\nMaintenance employees are trained in proper maintenance of the system and in proper safety procedures to be used while working on the system.  Delivery personnel receive extensive training and specially equipped to handle safely hydrofluoric acid.\n\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThe facility has had no releases of the regulated substance (70% hydrofluoric acid) in the last five years.\n\nEmergency response program\n\nBoth Municipal and private emergency response contractors are available 24-hours a day in case of an emergency.  Site specific plans have been developed in conjunction with the Beaver County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Emergency Management officials review the facility annually.\n\nDynamic Metal Forming has developed in conjunction with the Beaver County Emergency Management Agency and the Beaver County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Upon discovery that an emergency exists that requires outside assistance and public notification, the Facility Emergency Coordinator will contact the Beaver County Emergency Services Center (911) and have the Center alert the proper response organizations.  At the same time the Beaver County 9-1-1 will notify the Beaver County Hazardous Materials Response Team to be put on stand-by or request for support.  The Facility Emergency Coordinator will advi"
