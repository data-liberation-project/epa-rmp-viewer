Design has included features such as engineered controls to prevent overfilling of the tank, breakaway valve stations at the unloading area to minimize release should a truck pull away before uncoupling, monitoring stations for detection of accidental releases, and water sprays to help minimize migration of vapor releases.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis facility started up in 2005 with no prior history with anhydrous ammonia.  There have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the time of this filing.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nFPL employees are trained as Hazmat Technicians.  In the event of a large-scale release, site personnel will follow an established emergency response plan which includes notification of FPL management, 9-1-1 notification of local emergency responders, and firms that FPL has identified as having the capability and willingness to respond to anhydrous ammonia releases.\r\n\r\nLocal emergency personnel have been involved in training provided by FPL regarding the anhydrous ammonia facility and its potential risks.\r\n\r\nAll site personnel have received training.  Those without a direct involvement in the operations and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system have received overview (awareness) level training - what are the hazards, how can they be identified, and what to do in the event of a release.  Personnel who may have to enter a high concentration area in order to isolate a system with a manual valve, for example, have received 24-hour hazardous materials technician training.  They must remain clean-shaven at the point of SCBA mask contact, and have been instructed in the use of the appropriate protective PPE and SCBA"
