Ammonia is delivered by tanker truck in liquid form.  The maximum level to which it is filled is 85%.  In the tank, the ammonia is stored as liquid under pressure.  Pressure will vary from 80 to 300 psig.\n\nAmmonia vapor is transported via pressure to each heat recovery steam generator ammonia injection skid, where the ammonia is diluted with air prior to injection into the flue gas upstream of the catalyst.\n\nOPERATOR ORGANIZATION. \n\nFPL owns and operates the Manatee Power Plant, including Unit 3 as of June 2005, Martin-Manatee Power Partners (MMPP) previously operated Unit 3.  MMPP is a limited liability corporation formed by parent companies Zachry Construction Corporation and Black & Veatch Corporation for the purpose of engineering, procuring, and constructing the expansion of the Manatee power plant.  As a part of its contractual obligations to owner FPL, MMPP operated the facility for three months. Under that obligation, MMPP created an RMP Manual and submitted it to EPA in March 2005.   This document replaces that previously created by MMPP.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFPL has a long-established very high expectation regarding safety and environmental protection.  The following documents have been developed by FPL and are in practice at the Manatee Power Plant: \n-  Safe Work Practices Manual and SOPRs\n-  Site Emergency Action and Response Plan\n-  Site SPCC and SWPPP Plan\n\nCORPORATE SAFETY POLICY\n\nThe FPL Corporate Safety Policy is provided below to illustrate the Company's dedication and commitment to safety:\n\nThe SAFETY of our employees at work is a CORE VALUE of FPL Group.  No other business objective has higher priority.\n\nThis Safety Policy is to guide all employees in pursuing their responsibility, shared with the Company, to safeguard the health and well being of everyone involved with FPL Group.\n\nFP"

It is the responsibility of each employee to work safely for the benefit of the individual as well as co-workers.  This responsibility includes following appropriate safety rules and planning each work activity using appropriate risk assessment, good judgment and skills, along with a sincere dedication to work safely.\n\nEmployees should not start work until they understand what work is to be done and how to do it safely.  They are all expected to be engaged in the Company's Safety Management process.  Engagement includes communicating with all the parties involved about safety-related behaviors and conditions, and bringing to management's attention those issues which require their involvement and support.\n\nAll employees in leadership positions are responsible for deploying and actively supporting the Company's overall Safety Program.  Included in this responsibility are monitoring and enforcing the use of safe working practices and safety rules.\n\nAll of us, through our leadership, commitment and engagement must accept the challenge to work safely and actively to pursue injury and illness prevention.

Design has included features such as engineered controls to prevent overfilling of the tank, breakaway valve stations at the unloading area to minimize release should a truck pull away before uncoupling, monitoring stations for detection of accidental releases, and water sprays to help minimize migration of vapor releases.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility started up in 2005 with no prior history with anhydrous ammonia.  There have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the time of this filing.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nFPL employees are trained as Hazmat Technicians.  In the event of a large-scale release, site personnel will follow an established emergency response plan which includes notification of FPL management, 9-1-1 notification of local emergency responders, and firms that FPL has identified as having the capability and willingness to respond to anhydrous ammonia releases.\n\nLocal emergency personnel have been involved in training provided by FPL regarding the anhydrous ammonia facility and its potential risks.\n\nAll site personnel have received training.  Those without a direct involvement in the operations and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system have received overview (awareness) level training - what are the hazards, how can they be identified, and what to do in the event of a release.  Personnel who may have to enter a high concentration area in order to isolate a system with a manual valve, for example, have received 24-hour hazardous materials technician training.  They must remain clean-shaven at the point of SCBA mask contact, and have been instructed in the use of the appropriate protective PPE and SCBA.\n\nFPL considers the delivery of ammonia at the si"
