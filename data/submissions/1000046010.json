      "SummaryText": "New Haven Chlor-Alkali LLC is a manufacturer of sodium hypochlorite, commonly known as chlorine bleach.  Sodium hypochlorite is manufactured in two different processes at this company: 1) A modern salt plant, that uses electrolysis to break sodium chloride brine into sodium hydroxide, chloride, and hydrogen.  The sodium hydroxide and chlorine are immediately combined (no intermediate storage) to make sodium hypochlorite; 2) An older process, known as a \"Powell plant\" that uses chlorine and sodium hydroxide purchased in railcars, shipped from Niagara Falls, NY.  The \"Powell plant\" process runs only from May-October.  The \"Powell plant\" process is the regulated process.  \n\n\n\nThe hazard of this process is that we purchase and use chlorine in 90 ton railcars.  Chlorine has been used industrially for over 150 years; the railcar equipment used for transport and storage has been continually improved since 1909. Our policy is to follow all Federal and State safety requirements, and to go above and beyond by participating with industry Responsible Care and Responsible Distribution initiatives, and observing Chlorine Institute safe operating standards. We have active mitigation systems in place, redenundant shut-offs, site security, and our equipment is maintained and replaced as necessary to keep it in good operating condition.  Training in safety, emergency shut-down, and emergency response procedures are conducted regularly.  We have the equipment and training to shutdown manually or automatically, even during a release. Our process was designed and installed by a fabricator that has installed similar systems at over 100 locations worldwide. Information from \"near-misses\" at these facilities is shared among the facilities for continuous process improvement, coordinated through the fabricator.  This same fabricator sells us parts and periodically performs contract maintenance.  \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years.  "
