PLAQUEMINE FACILITY\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAxiall, LLC. Plaquemine Facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to protect people, property and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture Electrochemicals and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resins.  We have two regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantity present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine and Vinyl Chloride Monomer.  Chlorine is used in the manufacture of Vinyl Chloride Monomer.  Vinyl Chloride Monomer is used for feedstock in the manufacture of PVC resin.\n\n\n\nAxiall, LLC. schedules and plans for facility and unit outages for turnaround and maintenance purposes.  During these timeframes, the railcar inventories may increase.  The increase in inventory of the railcars has been reflected in the 2020 resubmission to ensure that the maximum potential inventory has been included.  There has not been an increase in production related inventories. \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention and process safety managements programs that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety"

The primary methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"HAZOP\" coupled with a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel which may include expertise in engineering, process operations, maintenance and environmental, health and safety.  In most cases, third-party PHA consultants are hired to facilitate the PHA, which allows for another form of expert opinions and guidance. Findings related to the hazard analysis are entered in our electronic tracking system.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,  we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The procedures also contain consequences of deviation and actions to take in order to maintain safe operation of the process.  The information is regularly reviewed, maintained through the management of change process, certified annually, and is readily accessible to workers involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nAxiall, LLC.  has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently at intervals determined by the complexity of the process and employee input.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification prior to working with the modified process.  In addition, operating procedures and associated PSI are updated as required.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at  Axiall, LLC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, training of affected personnel, and installation quality are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nAxiall, LLC. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
