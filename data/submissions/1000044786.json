This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as design basis/configuration information for key process parameters.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility\u00bfs processes.  The Tristream policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOUCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nTristream operates the Eustace Gas Processing Plant located in Henderson County, Texas.  This facility receives wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site.  The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes as pure products or in mixtures that are delivered to market via pipeline and transport vehicles.  The Eustace Gas Processing Plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.  This facility is classified as a Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Eustace Gas Processing Plant has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Eustace Gas Processing Plant.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA\u00bfs RMP regulations and to OSHA\u00bfs PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nTristream and the Eustace Gas Processing Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environ"

Tristream personnel utilize auditing processes to ensure the plant complies with safe operations of its processes.  In the event improvements in safety can be realized through auditing efforts, actions are planned and instituted to respond to safety enhancements of operating practices.  Improvements to safety are a continual process at the plant."

This technique is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Eustace Gas Processing Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Eustace Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are perio"

New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations. Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nThe Eustace Gas Processing Plant issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The Eustace Gas Processing Plant provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2) have received and understood the training required and carry a training document card while on location, (3) follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, (4) advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and (5) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.  \r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Eustace Gas Processing Plant conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e., monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks).\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) a review of the process hazards, and (3) the procedures applicable to the employee\u00bfs job tasks to ensure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe and satisfactory manner.  Process equipment inspection and testing follows recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Equipment deficiencies that are outside of acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to ensure safe operation.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change \r\n\r\nThe Eustace Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive system to manage and document changes to all covered processes. A systematic approach is followed to control and manage facility changes in order to minimize the possibility that such changes will have an adverse impact on personnel safety, equipment, or the environment.
