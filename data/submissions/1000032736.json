The Trahon/Big Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant treats municipal wastewater from the South Jackson and Byram areas. The facility discharges treated wastewater into Big Creek, and eventually into the Pearl River. \n\n  \n\nThe facility has 4,000 pounds of chlorine stored onsite at any one time, in cylinders.\n\n.  \n\nUnited Water Environmental Services has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Trahon Plant located in Jackson, MS. United Water's executive management team has committed to full implementation of RMP/PSM programs to prevent the release of highly hazardous substances.\n\n\n\nThere have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to RMP and OSHA PSM for chlorine.  \n\nA PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n\n\no Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\n\n\no Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\n\n\no Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine  management\n\n\n\no Chlorine system maintenance procedures \n\n\n\no Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\no Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine  processes\n\n\n\no Developing an Emergency Response Plan \n\n\n\no Training in support of the certification of operators\n\n          \n\nThe Operations Manager and Operations personnel annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations. \n\n     "

      "SummaryText": "     \n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plant has implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine.\n\n\n\no A full vacuum delivery system was installed inside dedicated chlorine and sulfur dioxide buildings. The vacuum process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.  \n\n\n\no Plant inventories are being maintained to a maximum of two ton containers of chlorine.\n\n\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. The services of a Hazmat Team to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are being periodically conducted.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. United Water Environmental Services has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\n\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n\n\n-Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\n\n-Lockout/Tagout\n\n\n\n-Confined Space\n\n"
