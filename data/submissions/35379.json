      "SummaryText": "Pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Secretary of Labor and Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency were required to promulgate a chemical process safety standard to prevent accidental releases of chemicals that could pose a threat to employees.  This resulted in a final ruling by Occupational Safety and Health Administration of \u00bfThe Process Safety Management Standard\u00bf in May of 1992.  Process Safety Management (\u00bfPSM\u00bf) is a self-auditing program that defines responsibilities of employers and contractors involved in work that affects (or occurs near) covered processes so that the safety of plant and contractor employees is adequately addressed.  PSM requirements have a structural format and the OSHA regulations provide the applicable details.\n\nThe Empire Geothermal Power Plant (\u00bfEmpire\u00bf) is located more then 14 miles from the town of Empire in Washoe County, Nevada.  Empire is a nominal 4.8-megawatt (\u00bfMW\u00bf) facility that generates power from natural geothermal water.  The facility has operated since 1987 without catastrophic incidences or releases.  Empire has a staff of five operators and a Plant Manager.  \n\nAt Empire, iso-pentane is used as the motive fluid in converting the naturally occurring geothermal energy into electrical energy in a \u00bfbinary cycle\u00bf power generation facility.  In the generation process, the iso-pentane liquid is preheated and vaporized, and the vapor used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.  The iso-pentane vapors exiting the turbine are cooled and condensed back into a liquid and reused in a closed loop cycle.  Fugitive and inherent operational pentane losses are made up from fresh iso-pentane stored onsite.  The process does not involve any chemical reactions or changes to the iso-pentane.\n\nA key item of the PSM program is the process hazard analysis that was performed in 1994 by the previous operator, Nevada Operations Incorporated.  This analysis used the Hazards and Operability Study (\u00bfHAZOP\u00bf) procedur"

The HAZOP concluded that potential deviations were of the \u00bfacceptable as is\u00bf category and identified appropriate response procedures to be used in the remote likelihood of their occurrence.  A supplemental \u00bfWhat If\u00bf analysis also was performed for the facility.  Empire has updated these analyses based on comments from the Nevada OSHES Compliance Unit.\n\nEmpire is committed to review and enhance the program periodically as appropriate and in compliance with program requirements.\n\nThe PSM program documents area complete and accessible to all interested persons at all times in accordance with the Proprietary Information statement.  We believe our program is proactive and not only meets the OSHA requirements but confirms our commitment to implementing our mission in providing a safe environment for our workers and contractors."
