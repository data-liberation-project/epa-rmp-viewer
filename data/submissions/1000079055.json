      "SummaryText": "This facility was constructed in 1977 and is currently used to distribute prepackaged industrial chemicals.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors. The resubmittal of this RMP is for chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are stored on site in ton and 150 pound cylinders. The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.   Harcros has a long-standing commitment to safety and protection of the environment where we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We are proud not to have an RMP reportable incident in the last 5-years.  As a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors we adhere to the principals of Responsible Distribution and are committed to continuous improvement.    \r\nHarcros is also members of The Chlorine Institute, which this facility's emergency response program is based upon their Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment and personal protective equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.  One such improvement Harcros is in process of completing is the installation of chlorine sensors.  Our response program is for chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks only.  We will not respond to other types of emergencies but will assist trained public and private emergency response personnel if required."
