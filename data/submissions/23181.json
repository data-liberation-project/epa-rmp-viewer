      "SummaryText": "The wastewater treatment plant is located approximately 1800 feet West of FM-312, East of SH-37, South of the City of Winnsboro, and in the northern part of Wood County, Texas.  Facilities are in place to store one ton cylinders of chlorine and to utilize these ton cylinders in the application of chlorine to the wastewater plant effluent to achieve disinfection.  The properties of chlorine that make it useful in the disinfection of wastewater make it necessary to observe safety precautions that will prevent unnecessary exposure to chlorine, thereby reducing the threat to the plant employees and also to reduce the threat to the persons in the community.  The Environmental Protection Agency considers chlorine a hazardous chemical.  Training of employees when they begin work and following the Prevention 2 Program recommendations should result in operating procedures that would allow a continuation of the previous six year period without a reportable accident.  A chlorine detector is mounted in the area to detect chlorine leaks.  Accidental release prevention is in effect and copies are retained in a manual available at the plant.  Emergency response policies will be applicable to the wastewater treatment facility and included in the RMP Manual at the plant."
