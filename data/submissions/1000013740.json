To fulfill these goals, we enroll in regulatory\nmanagement service that assists in maintaining and administering comprehensive safety and environmental programs,\nprocedures and training courses.  We perform a thorough annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the\nsafety standards and overseen assistance with this specialty firm.  The program consists of internal audit utilizing checklist\nsurvey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations\nare covered.  These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and\nstorage of anhydrous ammonia.  Procedures require a timely response and correction of all recommendations resulting\nfrom these audit checklists.  \n\nA \"Site Safety Coordinator\" is identified and used as an extension of the general manager and management service personnel\nfor a \"hands on\" manager of the day to day safe working activities, maintains the required regulatory recordkeeping, conducts\nemployee training, and acts as the location's contact during emergency incidents that are rehearsed biannually.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility is a wholesale farm supply and distribution center and as such we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides\nand fertilizers in"

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a\nregulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with this Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia\nto growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as\na needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia is also used for blending into mixed grade\nliquid fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is stored in 1 stationary storage tank with a capacity of 30,000 gallons.  131,000 pounds of Anhydrous\nAmmonia is the maximum storage capacity of this stationary storage tank.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount\nallowed (85% if capacity), released as a liquid over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released\nwould be 131,000 pounds.  According to DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM)\nwould have off-site impact.  It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternate release scenario(s) from an anhydrous ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint\noff-site.  The alternate release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a three-minute release from a stationary storage\ntank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shutdown.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in\nthis scenario would be 300 pounds from a storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint would not have an impact.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME\ncodes.
