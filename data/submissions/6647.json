      "SummaryText": "1.  FACILITY POLICY - The owner, manager and employees of Texoma Ag-Products, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If a release should occur, we are prepared to work with local fire department, medical agencies and law enforcement to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  We also blend dry bulk fertilizer for sale and custom application to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received , stored, sold to farmers and wholesaled to retail outlets for fertilizer for crop protection.  The maximum quantity stored at our location would be 552,000# in three storage tanks.  One tank is 30,000 gallons and we have two more that are 48,000 gallons a piece.  The maximum quantity handled at any time would be unloading of a rail car holding 150,000 to 160,000 pounds.\n\n3.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 210,000# from our 48,000 gallon storage tank at 85% capacity.  The distance to the end point is 2.4 miles.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likley potential release is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would be 5000# in a 2 minute period.  The distance to the end point is .28 miles.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM - The facility has excess flow valves, relief valves, emergency shutoff valves, and manual shutoff valves in place to help prevent accidental releases.  We have also implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\" and the standars of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.11, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility also has training and safety meetings on a "

We have a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120 including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY - Safety improvement is an on going process at our facility.  periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nPhil Kosse\nPlant Manager"
