ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES: We at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc.\r\nare strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and protection. This commitment is\r\ninherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design,\r\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this\r\nfacility. It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\r\nregulated substances. If an accidental release were to occur, Brenntag has coordinated emergency response\r\nactivities with the Macon County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Decatur Fire Department.\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: Our facility's primary activities\r\nencompass Distribution of chemical products. Currently, there is one regulated substances being introduced at this\r\nfacility that exceeds the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130. This substance includes\r\nchlorine. Chlorine is received in one-ton and 150 pound containers via van trailer and stored in our warehouse for future delvivery to our customers.\r\n\r\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: Our facility has taken necessary steps to\r\ncomply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68. The\r\none RMP regulated substance is also listed under OSHA's Process Safety Management Appendix A as set\r\nforth under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are currently in place at this facility.\r\n\r\na). Process Safety Information: Brenntag maintains a detailed record of written safety information that\r\ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all regulated\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nb).

The PHA's are completed by a team of\r\nqualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. PHA's are reviewed prior to the\r\nimplementation of any process change that involves the regulated substance; immediately following an\r\naccidental release or if an incident has occurred that could have resulted in an accidental release. At a\r\nminimum, PHA's are revalidation every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed\r\nin a timely manner.\r\n\r\nc). Operating Procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,\r\nBrenntag maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation\r\nsuch as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, emergency\r\noperations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround. Operating procedures are regularly\r\nevaluated and are accessible to all applicable employees involved within each regulated process.\r\n\r\nd). Training: Brenntag has a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees are competent in\r\nthe operating and safety procedures associated with the each regulated process. New employees receive\r\nbasic training in process operations and safety procedures, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are\r\ndeemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided whenever there has been a\r\nchange in the process or at a minimum once every 3 years.\r\n\r\ne). Maintenance: Brenntag conducts inspections and maintenance on handling and delivery (process) equipment to ensure\r\non-going equipment integrity. Qualified personnel receive specialized training to ensure that process\r\nequipment is properly inspected and maintained. Any equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and\r\ntimely manner.
