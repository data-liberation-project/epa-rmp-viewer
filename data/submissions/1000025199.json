The PHA's are completed by a team of\n\nqualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. PHA's are reviewed prior to the\n\nimplementation of any process change that involves the regulated substance; immediately following an\n\naccidental release or if an incident has occurred that could have resulted in an accidental release. At a\n\nminimum, PHA's are revalidation every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed\n\nin a timely manner.\n\n\n\nc). Operating Procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,\n\nBrenntag maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation\n\nsuch as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, emergency\n\noperations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround. Operating procedures are regularly\n\nevaluated and are accessible to all applicable employees involved within each regulated process.\n\n\n\nd). Training: Brenntag has a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees are competent in\n\nthe operating and safety procedures associated with the each regulated process. New employees receive\n\nbasic training in process operations and safety procedures, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are\n\ndeemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided whenever there has been a\n\nchange in the process or at a minimum once every 3 years.\n\n\n\ne). Maintenance: Brenntag conducts inspections and maintenance on handling and delivery (process) equipment to ensure\n\non-going equipment integrity. Qualified personnel receive specialized training to ensure that process\n\nequipment is properly inspected and maintained. Any equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and\n\ntimely manner.
