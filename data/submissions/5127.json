      "SummaryText": "\nArnco is in the business of synthetic rubber manufacturing, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code #2821.  One of the major ingredients of the raw material is toluene diisocyanate (TDI) unspecified isomer CAS# 26471-62-5.  TDI is the only acutely hazardous material (AHM) used in the production.  The Federal regulated threshold quantity for TDI unspecified isomer is 10,000 lbs.  \n\nThe off-site consequence analysis was conducted to evaluate the health and environmental impacts associated with the potential acute impacts of an accident.  Data from the Aloha model, provided by ABS Group Inc., determined the worst-case release endpoint distance for a TDI release.  The results are based on the technique described in EPA's Offsite Consequences Analysis Guidance.   \n\nOne worst case scenario was modeled.  The worst case was assumed to be a rupture of the 5,000-gallon TDI storage tank, regardless of its cause or likelihood.  It was determined that no residential population, public receptors, or environemental receptors is within the distance to endpoint. \nThe entire tank farm in Cleveland is indoors and has secondary containment to mitigate the consequences of any and all spills. \n \nArnco's facility in Cleveland, Ohio produces four main varieties of tirefill:  Permacor , Re-pneu, HeviDuty, and Superflex. \n\nThe property is leased from Pinpoint Construction, Inc.  The contact person is Mr. Eugene Diulus at (216) 341-4115.  Arnco currently employs 5 people in Cleveland, all in production.  There is only one shift for production between the hours of 6:00 AM to 3:30 PM.  \n \nTDI is a water-white to pale yellow liquid under room temperature.  The approximate vapor pressure at 200 C is 0.01 mm.  TDI slowly produces CO2 and polyureas when reacted with water.  Inhalation exposure and ingestion of TDI will cause strong irritation to skin and tissue, especially to the eyes.  The current Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) time weighted average (TWA) is 0.005 ppm."
