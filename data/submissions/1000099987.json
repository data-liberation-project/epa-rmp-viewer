The Plan includes responses for protection of employees, the environment, community and equipment resulting from hazardous releases of chemicals, including vinyl acetate and acetaldehyde.  Essential planning and training needed to ensure protection of workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations are fundamental to the Plan.  The Plan includes instructions for notifying the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) immediately when appropriate.  There are also emergency drills conducted by the site along with community first responders, sheriff's department and hospital.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nA PHA re-do of the Vinyl Acetate monomer manufacturing facility is scheduled to occur in 2022 that will provide a thorough evaluation of the Vinyl Acetate manufacturing process unit and will generate recommendations for improvement.  All recommendations are to be implemented in a reasonable and timely manner, with priority given-up to and including cessation of production-to implementation of recommendations, depending on the level of risk.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Celanese will continue efforts to help prevent and improve response to accidental chemical releases.  These continued efforts include the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf Utilize employee hazard-recognition programs to help identify and address \r\n  hazards within the site\r\n\r\n\u00bf Implement process safety best-practices through common Celan"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\n\r\nThe Celanese's Bay City facility produces commodity organic chemicals, such as Vinyl Acetate and Acetaldehyde, using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs is used to help ensure employee and public safety as well as protection of the environment in case of accidental release of these chemicals.\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nFive chemicals such as Vinyl Acetate and Acetaldehyde, Acrolein, Methane, and Ethylene have been found to be regulated substances under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program. Among these five chemicals, Vinyl Acetate and Acetaldehyde have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. \r\n\r\nToxics:\r\n\r\nVinyl acetate monomer is a major product.  It is produced in the Vinyl Acetate manufacturing process unit and is used largely in the manufacturing of adhesives and paints.  These materials are subsequently used for safety glass for automobiles, in floorings and rigid PVC pipe.  Approximately 4,000,000 pounds are stored on-site in the largest nitrogen inerted atmospheric storage tank. \r\n \r\nFlammables:\r\n\r\nAcetaldehyde is a byproduct in the production of vinyl acetate.  It is separated and sold in the merchant market.  Approximately 420,000 pounds of liquid acetaldehyde are stored in two pressurized spheres.  The standard operating procedure limits the inventory to less than or equal to 50% in each sphere. \r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment through the use of these chemicals.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nCelanese is committed to operating and maintaining all processes within the Complex in a safe and r"
