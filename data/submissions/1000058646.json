Newell has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals (anhydrous ammonia)located on site.  The facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) for the ammona refrigeration system using the industry standard What-If Checklist analysis develoiped through the International Insitute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR. The PHA was completed usingtechnical and operations staff from the Champaign facility as well experienced facilitators from SuperValu's corporate staff. W. Newell's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and the measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia.  The plans include preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety review and management of Change (MOC)to the system. The program also includes specific requiremsnt for tthe safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements.\nW.Newell undrtook a review of the potential offiste consequences  of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the system. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. W. Newell is committed to minimizing accidental releases from the"
