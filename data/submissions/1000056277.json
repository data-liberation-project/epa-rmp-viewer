The storage and handling system consists of one storage tank\n(26,000 gallon), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to\nauthorized facility, employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\nThe facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive\ninformation it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and\nregulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as\nadopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
