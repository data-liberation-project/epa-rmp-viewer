Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\nThe management and employees of Southern FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental\nreleases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with\nthe local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release\nto people and the environment.\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\nThe primary activity of the facility, which is located at 140 State Route 37 North, Boles, IL, is the storage and\nblending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct\napplication as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of one storage tank\n(26,000 gallon), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to\nauthorized facility, employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\nThe facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive\ninformation it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and\nregulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as\nadopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".

The emergency response program.\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n- In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Buncombe Volunteer Fire Department and the Johnson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the\nmaintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
