Appropriate emergency responses are in effect for dealing with the release of toxic and/or flammable chemicals. \n\nThe Equistar Chemicals Clinton Complex is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  The Risk Management Program at the Clinton Complex helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner.  This program is only one component of the safety program at the plant. It is the policy of Equistar to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, and to act responsibly in the prevention of accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals.  The plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.  \n\n \n\n\n\nThe TheEquistar Clinton Complex has consists of the following facilities processes that are covered by this Rule:  High Density and Low Density Polyethylene production, and Ethylene production areas.  The Clinton plant?s key products are ethylene, low density polyethylene, and high density polyethylene.  The Clinton plant uses feedstocks of ethane and propane.  \n\n\n\nAn Equistar Chemical Corporation RMP Policy has been created to provide a management system for implementing the Rule at covered Corporate sites. \n\n\n\nThe toxic substances handled in those covered areas area may be as follows: Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater), chlorine, and Vinyl acetate monomer.   \n\n\n\nThe flammable substances handled in those covered areas may beare as follows:  Acetylene, 1,3-Butadiene, Butane, Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isopentane, Methane, 3-Methyl-1-butane, 2-Methyl-1-butane, Pentane, Propane, and Propylene."

Auxiliary programs such as Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures and Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan are in place and effective.  The Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures procedure establishes the proper course of action in the event of the discharge of a hazardous substance or oil.  Additionally, preventive measures and precautions pertaining to specific hazardous substances handled and stored at Equistar are described.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe chemical-specific precaution steps for this facility primarily concentrates on the class of chemicals known as flammables.  These steps are as follows:\n\n\n\n General\n\n\n\n Measures to prevent the release of propylene flammables are centered around complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Using the standards of OSHA PSM and American Petroleum Institute (API), Propylene flammables handlers have designed their equipment and procedures to minimize the risk of a propylene release.  Preventive measures that can be used to minimize risks are described below.\n\n\n\nFirst, there are some General preventive measures dictated by OSHA's PSM standards that are strictly followed to minimize the risk of propylene releases are described below..\n\n\n\n1.  A complete, in-depth process hazard analysis is completed every five years by qualified personnel as specified by OSHA's PSM standard.\n\n\n\n2.  Operating procedures are used for directing and training the operators who are requalified every three years.\n\n\n\n3.  Operators, maintenance, and contractor personnel working with or close to propylene related equipment are trained and qualified to handle it safely.\n\n\n\n4.

Propylene Flammable tank car unloading is closely monitored.  In some cases, propylenegas detection alarms are used and will quickly identify a leak.\n\n\n\n11.  Automatic shut-off valves for shutting down the propylene unloading process can be activated by low unloading pressure, leak detection, and manually from different plant locations.\n\n\n\n12.  Propylene Flammable unloading station can be isolated from other operations to reduce exposure to any fires or other accidents.\n\n\n\n13.  Water deluge systems can be used to displace propylene flammable gas vapors if a leak should occur.  Also water deluge systems are used to cool vessels and pipelines during a fire situation.\n\n\n\n14.  Critical processes can be computer controlled to ensure continuous monitoring of all operating parameters and immediate shutdown of the production units.\n\n\n\n15.
