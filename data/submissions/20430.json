As part of this commitment, SENA has established procedures to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facilities.  SENA's Biron Mill (Biron) has developed a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and helps to manage the risks of the covered substances and processes.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at Biron.  This document is intended to satisfy the risk management plan requirements of the RMP rule.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIn April 1967, Consolidated Papers, Inc. adopted a corporate environmental policy that guides the continuous improvement of its environmental performance as it strives to prevent pollution and achieve the objective of operating facilities with minimal environmental impact.  This policy was updated in November 1996.  On August 31, 2000 Consolidated Papers, Inc. was aquired by Stora Enso, Oyj. of Helsinki, Finland. SENA's environmental policy statement is publicly available on the Stora Enso Internet website.  As part of its risk reduction objective, SENA will strive to minimize environmental, health, and safety risks to its employees and the communities in which it operates by employing safe technologies and operating procedures.  SENA will be constantly prepared for emergencies.  SENA will continually inform its employees and public of its progress in safety and environmental issues.  \n\nSENA is one of 26 Wisconsin paper companies voluntarily participating in the Wisconsin Paper Council's Pollution Prevention Partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

SENA's Pollution Prevention Partnership Progress Report is available to the public.  \n\n\nSENA has also pledged to voluntarily align its corporate Environmental Management System to ISO 14001 international standards and to adhere to the American Forest and Paper Association's Environmental Health and Safety Principles.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSENA is a leading producer in North America of coated printing papers and a major manufacturer of supercalendered printing papers for the printing and publishing industries.  In addition, SENA is a leading manufacturer of coated specialty papers used in consumer product packaging and labeling. SENA also produces elemental chlorine-free kraft pulp for its own use from virgin wood fiber, and recycled pulp from printed and post-consumer wastepaper.  Other products manufactured by SENA include paperboard and paperboard products.\n\nStora Enso, Oyj. is domiciled in Helsinki, Finland. SENA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stora Enso Oyj., is based in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin. It operates paper and pulp manufacturing facilities in Biron, Kimberly, Appleton, Niagara, Stevens Point, Whiting, and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, as well as in Duluth, Minnesota.  It also operates wastewater treatment plants in Stevens Point, Niagara, Kimberly, and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin to treat wastewater generated by the pulp and paper manufacturing plants.  Wastewater treatment is also done at the facilities in Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nBiron is a pulp and paper mill operated by SENA in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin.  At this facility, groundwood pulp and thermomechanical pulp are produced and then used to manufacture lightweight groundwood coated printing papers.

The sulfur dioxide is stored in a horizontal aboveground tank with a design capacity of 9,000 gallons (109,810 lb of sulfur dioxide).  Administrative controls limit the quantity of sulfur dioxide stored in the tank to 80% of capacity or 7,200 gallons (87,848 lb).  Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas liquefied by pressure in the storage tank and is used to bleach pulp.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nTwo worst-case release scenarios at Biron were analyzed, both involving a toxic substance (sulfur dioxide)\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involving sulfur dioxide is defined as the rupture of the sulfur dioxide storage tank, instantaneously releasing its entire contents directly to the surrounding ground.  With the administrative controls that limit the tank storage to 80% of the tank's design capacity, the tank stores approximately 87,848 lb (7,200 gallons) of sulfur dioxide.   Prior to unloading a shipment of sulfur dioxide, the Pulp Mill Shift Supervisor verifies that the load can be added to the tank while maintaining less than 80% capacity.  The tank truck driver monitors the unloading process under the supervision of the pulp mill shift supervisor until it is concluded.\n\nThe entire spill is assumed to evaporate into the atmosphere.  A drain system around the tank would be able to direct the spilt tank contents to the process sewer within 10 minutes.  However, for this worst-case scenario, the entire tank contents are assumed to evaporate into the atmosphere within 10 minutes.  This scenario was modeled using the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) model to predict the toxic endpoint.  The worst-case release of sulfur dioxide is predicted to have offsite im"

The alternative release scenario is defined as a failure of the tubing connecting the sulfur dioxide tank to the process equipment.  Approximately 57,144 lb of sulfur dioxide are released.  The Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model was used to predict the toxic endpoint.  The worst-case release of sulfur dioxide is predicted to have offsite impacts on public receptors.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of its environmental policy, SENA will continue to protect the environment and the health and well-being of employees and communities by monitoring existing facilities to ensure that they meet all legal requirements through the use of safe technologies and operating procedures.\n\nBiron complies with the prevention and emergency response procedures from all applicable regulations including certain applicable sections of RCRA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38).\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Biron Mill in the past five years that resulted in any adverse onsite or offsite impacts.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nBiron's emergency response program includes a written Emergency Response Plan that discusses procedures to be followed in the case of a general emergency and specific procedures for the handling of sulfur dioxide and chlorine spills to prevent and minimize the effects of an emergency involving these chemicals. \n\nSENA has a Spill Reporting Policy that addresses the notification requirements in the event of an accidental release.

The employee is then responsible for notifying his or her supervisor who will coordinate the appropriate response.  If the situation requires HAZMAT response, the pulp mill shift supervisor will initiate a HAZMAT response and establish an incident command.  The only exception is in the case of fire and/or explosion, in which case the incident command will be transferred to the Biron Fire Department when they are present.\n\nBiron has specific response plans for sulfur dioxide.  In the response, the responsible shift supervisor will communicate with the division environmental staff to ensure proper agency notifications are given as outlined in the Corporate Spill Reporting Policy.  Specialized training in handling sulfur dioxide releases is part of the regular training for HAZMAT teams.\n\nHAZMAT response includes coordination with the Wood County Sheriff Department and the Biron Fire Department.  Biron personnel maintain onsite incident command except as previously noted.\n\nThe mill has mutual aid agreements with the HAZMAT response team from Plover, Wisconsin for additional onsite support.\n\nWood County Emergency Government Agency would be called upon in the case of community involvement and would aid in coordinating local emergency response organizations in the affected area.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nThis facility will undergo regular scheduled maintenance and update to meet any new or revised applicable regulation and industry standard to continue to operate safely.\n\nThe potential elimination of sulfur dioxide is being evaluated."
