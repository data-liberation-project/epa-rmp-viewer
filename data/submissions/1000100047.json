This commitment is determined by the resources invested in accident prevention, which includes training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nPrism Midstream, LLC owns and operates the Bedrock Liquids Handling Facility, a natural gas processing plant, located in Crockett County, Texas.  The handling facility is designed to store both NGLs and condensate.  The incoming NGL streams and condensate are stabilized and treated to meet sales specifications and routed to pressurized tanks for storage.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, the Bedrock Liquids Handling Facility is a Program 1 process.\r\n\r\nThe regulated flammable substances identified at the facility are NGL and unstabilized condensate.  For the purpose of identifying the maximum release quantity for use in determining potential off-site impacts, it is assumed that the entire contents of the vessel or the system are released to the atmosphere, forming a vapor cloud.  NGL (Off Spec) stored in TK-103 (Off Spec NGL Storage Tank) with a level of 54,000 gallons was determined to result in the WCS.  The distance to the endpoint of 1-psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable mixture was calculated and determined to be 0.52 mile.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident Facility\r\nThe Bedrock Liquids Handling Facility is a new facility; therefore, this facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nLocal Emergency Response Coordination\r\nThe Bedrock Liquids Handling Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the local fire department.  Also, operators of the"

To control and manage facility changes, a systematic approach is followed to minimize the possibility that such changes will have an adverse impact on personnel safety, equipment or the environment.  Any employees, process operators or maintenance personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nPrism Midstream, LLC promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The investigation is led by an incident investigation team consisting of those with appropriate knowledge and experience in the process.  These investigations are completed to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as corrective actions that could prevent the release from reoccurring.  The findings of the investigation are documented and the results are reviewed by all employees who have the potential to be affected by the findings.\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response\r\nThe Bedrock facility keeps a written emergency response plan onsite which includes the designated actions the company and all employees will take to ensure personal safety from fire and other emergencies.  The plan outlines actions that employees are to take when there is a release and facilitates the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Bedrock facility will conduct audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being properly implemented.
