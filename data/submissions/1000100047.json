This commitment is determined by the resources invested in accident prevention, which includes training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nPrism Midstream, LLC owns and operates the Bedrock Liquids Handling Facility, a natural gas processing plant, located in Crockett County, Texas.  The handling facility is designed to store both NGLs and condensate.  The incoming NGL streams and condensate are stabilized and treated to meet sales specifications and routed to pressurized tanks for storage.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, the Bedrock Liquids Handling Facility is a Program 1 process.\n\n\n\nThe regulated flammable substances identified at the facility are NGL and unstabilized condensate.  For the purpose of identifying the maximum release quantity for use in determining potential off-site impacts, it is assumed that the entire contents of the vessel or the system are released to the atmosphere, forming a vapor cloud.  NGL (Off Spec) stored in TK-103 (Off Spec NGL Storage Tank) with a level of 54,000 gallons was determined to result in the WCS.  The distance to the endpoint of 1-psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable mixture was calculated and determined to be 0.52 mile.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident Facility\n\nThe Bedrock Liquids Handling Facility is a new facility; therefore, this facility has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nLocal Emergency Response Coordination\n\nThe Bedrock Liquids Handling Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the local fire department.
