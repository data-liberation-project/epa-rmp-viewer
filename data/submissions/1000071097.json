The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the terminal has developed procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to terminal processes or operations. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the terminal is coordinated with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which are attended by local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident,"

The terminal is a petroleum bulk terminal storing gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel ethanol.  Gasoline and diesel fuel are received at this facility via Plantation Pipeline and Colonial Pipeline from the Gulf Coast.  Gasoline Additives, Diesel Additive, and Fuel Ethanol are received at the terminal by way of tank trucks.  The terminal also has the capability of receiving petroleum products by tank trucks.  All petroleum products are stored at this facility in aboveground tanks and loaded into tank trucks.  Off-specification product (Transmix) is also stored at the facility until it can be returned for recycling. All petroleum products are distributed from this facility by way of tank trucks.\r\n\r\nChevron Products Company has a butane blending process at the terminal to inject butane into its gasoline immediately prior to truck loading of various gasoline products.  The terminal receives butane via tanker trucks and stores the butane in one (1) 60,000-gallon pressurized horizontal butane storage vessel.  The butane blending operation and associated butane storage render the terminal subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, this operation renders the terminal subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR \u00a71910.119.  As such, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\nChevron and the terminal have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety, which is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.

However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe 60,000-gallon storage vessel at the facility carries a flammable mixture consisting of normal butane, isobutane, isopentane, hexane, olefins, normal pentane, and propane.  The flammable mixture possesses physical characteristics of a NFPA No. 4 flammable material and the weight percentages of each constituent vary; therefore, for modeling purposes, it is assumed that the entire weight of the flammable mixture is normal butane.  It should be noted that an analysis was also performed using the other constituents in the flammable mixture but the resulting endpoint distance was no greater using any of these constituents either as the entire weight of the flammable mixture or in varying percentages. The facility utilizes administrative controls to not allow the vessel to be filled beyond eighty (80) percent capacity; therefore, the storage volume of the vessel is 48,000 gallons.  In addition, according to the process safety information an estimated 607 gallons of the flammable mixture may be contained in process piping and associated appurtenances, and this quantity is also included in the worst-case release scenario as these may rupture in the event of a catastrophic release.  Therefore, the maximum storage capacity of this flammable mixture in the 60,000-gallon storage vessel, process piping, and associated appurtenances for the worst-case flammable release scenario taking into account administrative controls is estimated at 239,175.6 pounds (48,607 gallons), assuming a specific gravity of 0.59 for the flammable mixture.\r\n\r\nThe latitude and longitude of the storage vessel are 33\u00b0 54' 40.842\" North (33.911345\u00b0) and 84\u00b0 16' 19.3836\" West (-84.272051\u00b0), respe"

This worst-case scenario has the potential to impact an estimated population of 1,837 people.  No schools or hospitals were identified within the impact area; however, Hightower Elementary, to the North, is just outside the impact area.  Additionally, within the impact area are a farmer's market and shopping center to the South, as well as multiple industrial facilities.  No sensitive environmental receptors were identified as potentially being affected by the worst-case release scenario. \r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nAs a RMP Prevention Program 3 facility, the facility is required to submit one alternative release scenario for an accidental flammable release.  A possible alternative flammable release scenario is a release at the butane unloading area as a result of a truck accidentally pulling away while still connected or a hose misconnection or malfunction during the unloading operation.  This scenario was identified as a possibility in the process hazards analysis for the butane blending process.  The butane released could potentially ignite due to an engine spark and could cause the butane truck being unloaded to catch fire or reach a critical temperature, eventually resulting in a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE).  The BLEVE scenario yields a more conservative endpoint distance than that of a flash fire or vapor cloud fire thus the BLEVE was selected as the alternative scenario.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a flash fire or vapor cloud fire, this BLEVE alternative scenario should be referred to wh"

In the event of a release of this magnitude, the facility will make every effort to verify that the impacted area has been evacuated.
