All cuurent applicable ANSI and ASTm standards are strictly followed regarding the maintenance and operation of this facility.\n\nDiamond Vogel - North Inc. is a producer of liquid architectural and industrial coatings. One of the processes utilized here is the incorporation of Toluene diisocyanante (TDI) as a catalyst for making certain coatings. The TDI is stored in a single 6,000-gallon vessel that is in an isolated room. The controls for the incorporation of the TDI into the mixing process are in a second separate room. All of the parts on the storage vessel and the incorporation process are approved for use with TDI.\n\nThe facility is only operated during normal business hours, operating only a single work shift. A hard-wired alarm system and a quick response security company protect the facility during all non-work hours.\n\nThe off site consequences analysis involve the single bulk storage vessel containing 6,000-gallons maximum capacity of Toluene diisocyanate. These scenarios include a worst case release and altenative release scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of a vessel is released as a liquid with susequent vaporization. With the release happening in a ten minute time frame. The altenative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of the toxic liquid due to faulty transfer equipment.\n\nThe worst Case scenario involves a catastophic failure of the storage vessel releasing the entire 51,918 pounds of Toluene diisocyanate. The off site consequences were calculated using the EPA's RMP*COMP guidance program. The worst case scenario used the EPA's wind speed of 1.5 meters/second with an F atmospheric stability class.

With this determination Diamond Vogel - North Inc. qualifies as a catagory 1 facility and the alternative release scenario is not required.\n\nAlthough Diamond Vogel - North Inc. qualifies as a catagory 1 facility there are several steps that have been taken to insure the integrity and safety for accident prevention."
