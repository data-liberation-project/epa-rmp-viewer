      "SummaryText": "The Briess Malt & Ingredients Company Waterloo facility is located at 901 West Madison Street, Waterloo, WI.  This facility manufactures various malts for the brewing industry.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Action Policies for Facility - This facility's policy is to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In event an emergency were to occur, the facility has coordinated response services with the Waterloo Fire Department for anything more than an incidental release.  \n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled - This facility manufactures various types of malt for the brewing industry.  One manufacturing process at the facility includes malt sulfuring.  During this process, sulfur dioxide is introduced to a furnace with a malt under controlled conditions, to improve the physical appearance.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in a 6,500 gallon tank and piped to the furnaces.  Heat tapes are used to regulate the temperature of the product in the tank, which in turn maintains the pressure range needed to move sulfur dioxide gas through the piping network.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps - The facility has developed a prevention program in accordance with Subpart D of 40 CFR 68 (Program 3) and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nEmergency Response Program - In the event of a fire or chemical release at the facility, the Waterloo Fire Department will be notified. The facility has discussed its policies with the fire department and it periodically provides informational sessions to its members.  Additionally, members of the fire department have inspected the sulfur dioxide system as part of their facility-wide safety inspection.  In the event of a chemical release, the fire department will notify the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee."
