We have also provided supporting documentation for our hazard assessment results and population estimations.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nBecause our company has a strong regard for environmental protection, product stewardship and safety concerns, we conduct our activities in such a manner as to protect the physical environment, our employees, our customers, and the general public.  We comply with environmental, stewardship and safety laws and regulations; and develop and implement programs to insure compliance. We are both responsible and responsive in our efforts relating to environmental protection, product stewardship and employee safety.\n\nWhere our company becomes aware of environmental and product safety risks not covered by existing laws or regulations, we develop our own good faith standards and practices based on comprehensive and relevant scientific data.  We cooperate with the public, government, industry and employees in identifying environmental, product stewardship and safety goals and in developing effective control programs.  Each operating unit of the company is expected to be guided by this policy in forming plans, setting objectives, and conducting their day-to-day activities.\n\nOur emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The facility is fenced to help keep it secure.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n \nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  \n \nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce specialty ingredients, nutritional additives, and environmental products for an"

The capacity of the storage tank is 15,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  The tank is designed to store 85 percent of its capacity; therefore, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the plant is approximately 12,750 gallons, or approximately 75,000 pounds.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n \nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations including OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment.  Delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained regarding anhydrous ammonia hazards and emergency response.  Our employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing anhydrous ammonia to our site. We lease our anhydrous ammonia storage from anhydrous ammonia vendors and require them to periodically inspect our anhydrous ammonia system, and make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to continue to ensure safe handling and use of anhydrous ammonia.\n \n4. Five-year accident history:\n \nOver the last five years, there have been no reportable accidental releases, injuries, or environmental damage resulting from our anhydrous ammonia system.\n\n \n5. The emergency response program:\n \nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the management system we have in place and the appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with our local emergency responders.  We have discussed this program with the Hitchcock Fire Department.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\nA process hazard analysis of our anhydrous ammonia system was conducted during insert date.  From this review,"
