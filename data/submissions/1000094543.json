Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAvantor Inc;, a Fortune 500 company, is a leading global provider of mission-critical products and services to customers in the biopharma, healthcare, education & government, and advanced technologies & applied materials industries. Our portfolio is used in virtually every stage of the most important research, development and production activities in the industries we serve. One of our greatest strengths comes from having a global infrastructure that is strategically located to support the needs of our customers. Our global footprint enables us to serve more than 225,000 customer locations and gives us extensive access to research laboratories and scientists in more than 180 countries. We set science in motion to create a better world.\n\n\n\nAvantor operates the VWR International facilities located in the United States. Management is not only committed to offering superior supplies and services, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program Distribution Manager with the assistance from corporate Senior Chemical Specialist, who all conduct periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and will oversee the entire safety and environmental programs, including the RMP Program.\n\n\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nVWR International (VWR) is a distributor of high-quality chemicals and laboratory supplies.  The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in containers that meet the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations and that typically range from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume.  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  \n\n\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered "

Under EPA regulations, the VWR covered process would be required to meet the Prevention Program 2 requirements because VWR is not covered by one of the NAICS codes listed as subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements nor is it subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  However, under the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA) regulations, all covered processes must comply with the Prevention Program 3 requirements.  Therefore, for simplicity, VWR is registering the covered process as a Prevention Program 3 program under both the EPA and New Jersey programs.\n\n\n\nAt the present time, there are four substances that could exceed a threshold quantity under the EPA and New Jersey programs:\n\n\n\n-    Hydrochloric acid (36% by weight or more HCl) - potentially exceeds the New Jersey-only threshold quantity and is only subject to the NJ TCPA regulations; however, for simplicity, the hydrochloric acid is included in the EPA registration as well\n\n\n\n-    Chloroform\n\n\n\n-    Hydrofluoric acid (concentration 50% or greater)\n\n\n\n-    Ethyl ether\n\n \n\nC.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nVWR has developed and implemented a release prevention program in accordance with the NJ TCPA regulations for the storage of the covered chemicals.  The release prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n-    Process Safety Information\n\n-    Process Hazard Analysis with Risk Assessment\n\n-    Standard Operating Procedures\n\n-    EHS Operator Training \n\n-    Mechanical Integrity/Preventive Maintenance \n\n-    Management of Change \n\n-    Pre-Startup Review \n\n-    Compliance Audit \n\n-    EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation \n\n-    Employee Participation \n\n-    Hot Work Permit \n\n-    Contractors\n\n-    Emergency Response \n\n-    Annual Reports\n\n-    Inherently Safer Technology Review\n\n\n\nThe need for chemical specific prevention steps is very limited because chemicals are contained within sealed, D"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantities of 10 lbsof chloroform, 100 lbs of ethyl ether, 100 lbs of hydrofluoric acid, 100 lbs of formaldehyde, or 5,000 pounds of hydrochloric acid, or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the past five years (June 2016 - June 2021). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of an RMP regulated substance, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nE.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nVWR has developed a comprehensive emergency response program, the site Integrated Prevention and Response Plan, that addresses small and large-scale incidents, including coordination with outside agencies and responders.  This plan has been approved by the State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection under its Discharge Prevention, Containment and Countermeasures (DPCC) and Discharge Cleanup & Removal (DCR) Plan requirements.\n\n\n\nF.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nVWR's procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventive measures keep its employees, the community and the environment safe.  VWR is also committed to working our corrective action process to monitor and improve the safety of all operations.  Through our NJ TCPA program, VWR always looks for possible system changes to improve safety in our facility.\n\n"
