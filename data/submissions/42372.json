It is bordered on the north by Napa Auto Part Distribution Center, on the south by Sierra Aluminum Company\u00bfs Union Building, on the east by Pacific Avenue and on the west by the Union Pacific Railroad (Dixon Branch). \n\nDistances from Fontana Finishing Division Building to the property lines:\n\nNorth, 36 feet from building wall to fence line (Napa Auto Part Distribution Center).\n\nSouth, 214 feet from building wall to Sierra Aluminum\u00bfs Union Building.\n\nEast 97 feet from building wall to curb line on Pacific Avenue. \n\nWest, 43.8 feet from building wall to fence. \n\nThe Fontana Finishing Division operates a 32 tank anodizing facility, one vertical paint line and off line saw operation. The paint line utilizes Alodine 47S which is used to pre-treat the aluminum prior to painting. Alodine 47S contains 20% Hydrogen Fluoride (Hydrofluoric Acid) \n\nPaint Pre-Treatment Overview \n\nIn order to comply with the American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) 2605 and U.S. Military,Mil-C-5541 standards, Sierra Aluminum uses Alodine 47S, manufactured by Henkel Surface Technologies, which contains 19% to 20% Hydrogen Fluoride(Hydrofluoric Acid)  in the aluminum pre treatment stage. AAMA 2605 and Mil-C-5541 require a chromate pre-treatment process to meet their corrosion and durability requirements. Alodine 47S is a coating that is applied to the surface of the extruded aluminum prior to painting the aluminum. \n\nWorst case scenario in our example would be a breach of the largest vessel, a drum containing 470 lbs. of 20% HF Solution.\n\nThe equations used are in Appendix D of the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis. See Excel Spread Sheet for Values.\n\nDrum contains: H2O = 373.61 lbs.\n                      HF    = 96.39 lbs.\n\nSpill would take place in the building with a volume of 3090000 FT\u00b3. at 25 deg C. \n\nThe toxic end point of one tenth the IDLH"

This would qualify our process as a Program 1 RMP.\n\nOur procedures call for the delivery of the material to take place within the building and storage of the material to be in containment units.
