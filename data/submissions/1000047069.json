We have provoded State and Local authorities all Community Right-to Know infromation required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergeny planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emeregncy Planning Committee to ensure that they conform to the community plan. We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia training program by the local fire department(s), local emergency response team, hazardous materials responders, community planners, etc., tehta may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at our facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific recommendations for implementation at this time.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nFor additional information, response to questions, facility tours, or comments, please contact Richard Murphy at 1-308-882-3268."

In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\r\n\r\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\r\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 11511, support activities for crop production. Our facility engages in the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. This product is subject to theEPA Risk Management Program and is subject of this plan. Only the facility used for this product will be included in this report.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct appliaction to farm fields during the early spring and fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored only with little if any product transfers taking place. The maximum quantity stored has been listed earlier in the RMP and will not be disclosed in this summary. Mamimum quantity handled at a given time will be the unloading of  arail tank car or a semi-trailer tank.\r\n\r\nOur facilities have adeqaute lighting, and are inspected day and night during use, and through out the off season.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\r\nOur accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is based on guidelines found in the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. Additionally, we conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transporatation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including but not limited to: excess flow vavles, breakaway coupler"
