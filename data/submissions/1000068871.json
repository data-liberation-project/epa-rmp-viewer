Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers Capital Group LLC. interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis.

Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment.\n\n\n\nA-2   STATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers Capital Group LLC. utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to provide cold storage and temperature cool down of harvested tree fruit crops. The refrigeration system runs almost year-round to keep cooler room temperatures for product quality.  However due to seasonal changes sometimes the system is pumped down and shut off due to no product available.\n\n\n\nThe facility is in Sutter County on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the cooler refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system is a direct mechanical refrigeration system. The Sacramento Valley Walnut Growers Capital Group LLC. facility was constructed in three stages.  The stages started in 1997, then in 2003 and the final building stage occurred in 2006 with minor changes made in 2016 and 2017.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia equipment is in the machine (engine) room, outside on the"

Investigations are initiated within 48-hours of an incident using a team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Employee Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community.
