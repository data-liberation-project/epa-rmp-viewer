If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Iroquois County  LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the enviorment.\n\n       2.Facility Information.\n\n      The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received,stored and distributed for diredt application AS A NUTRIENT for crop production. The maximum quanity stored would be 250,000 pounds in storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n         3.   Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n          a. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contets of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the LARGEST storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.1 miles. \n\n          B.  The alternate release scenario, a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 miles. (The most likley potential incident,would be a release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automaic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops th"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n           The facility is in compliance with the U.S. Occupational Safey and Health (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the \"State of Illinois,Fertilizer Law Subpart A, Anhydrous Ammonia.\" The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3(b)\n\n    5.   Five-Year Accident History\n\n           There have been no accidental releases of anhdrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or signifiacnt property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths,injuries,evacuations,propertry damage,or environmental damage. \n\n     6.

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the equired response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n              1. Within 1 Hour of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n                 The National Emergency Response Center @ 800/424/8802\n              2.
