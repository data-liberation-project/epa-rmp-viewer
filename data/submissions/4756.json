Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at D & F Agricultural Services, Inc. in Marlin are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Marlin Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 18,000- and two 12,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in Marlin \n(Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 35,700 gallons (183,712.2 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected anhydrous ammonia storage tank (183,712.2 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-\nminute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the\nmaximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 6 miles (F"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 1,000.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nD & F Agricultural Services, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes\nthe chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nD & F Agricultural Services, Inc. maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities\nwithin our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in\nthe processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nD & F Agricultural Services, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nD & F Agricultural Services, Inc. conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment\nto ensure proper opera"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at D & F Agricultural Services, Inc. to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nD & F Agricultural Services, Inc. routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new\nprocesses and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nD & F Agricultural Services, Inc. conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine\nwhether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.
