Our outside contractor is\nEnvironmental Technology and Services of Kansas City, MO.\n\nThe worst case scenerio that could occur within the facility would be from the result of a major fire or natural disaster\ncausing the release of all 9,000 lbs. of ammonia. In this scernio our facility operators would isolate the release\nand notify outside contractor.\n\nThe most likely scernio for our facility would be from the result of equipment failure, thus causing a release of <100\nlbs. of ammonia. In this case our facility operators would then isolate the release and make nessary repairs\nto the system. The plant engineer would then notify supervisor of the release to make proper notifications needed\ndepending on the size of the release.\n\nMidwest Cold Storage L.L.C., is always looking for ways to improve the safety for our emploees and the community in\nthe handling of ammonia within the facility. That is the reason for submitting this RMP even though our facility is\nbelow the reportable requirment of 10,000 lbs. We stride to improve the environment and be considered\ngood community corporate people."
