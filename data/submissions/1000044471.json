The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of T and T Fertilizer Inc. should a release occur, are prepared to work\n\nwith the various fire departments or other authorities. To mitigate any release and minimize the impact of\n\nthe release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\na The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nb Aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed\n\ngrade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nc The maximum quantity stored would be 260000  pounds in all of our storage tanks. The largest of which is\n\n20000 gallons.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario.\n\na. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a\n\nLiquid over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130000 lbs which represents the volume\n\nof the largest storage tank at capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of\n\ndispersion to 200 PPM) is .7 miles. This release would have off-site impacts.\n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential\n\nincident) is a release from a break or tear in a transfer pipe or gasket releasing 5250lbs. This pipe is used to\n\ntransfer product. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .1 miles. This release\n\nwould have off-site impacts.\n\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\", published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards\n\nof the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of\n\nanhydrous ammonia\". This facility has also complied with the Indiana Ammonia"

The five-year Accident History\n\nA T and T Fertilizer had a tank explosion on October 3, 2011 where 4 people were injured. There was no life threatening injuries sustained but use of an ambulance was used.  \n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. Written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as\n\nrequired under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\n\nc. Written emergency response program. In accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre\n\nemergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\n\nrecommendations for implementation at this time\n\n"
