Accident release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThis distribution facility stores chlorine containers occasionally and plans to store sulfur dioxide containers in the foreseeable future.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are considered hazardous.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility will be to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide will be received in 150 pound cylinders and 2000 pound containers and will be shipped in the same packages.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine to be stored at this facility is 50,000 pounds.  The maximum total inventory of sulfur dioxide to be stored at this facility will be 30,000 pounds.  Average inventories will be much less.\n\n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the N"

      "SummaryText": "ational Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n4.    Five-year accident history.\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases involving regulated chemicals that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n5.    The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility does not currently have its own emergency response team.  Until we have our own, properly trained team, emergency response will be by public responders, by trained response teams from other, nearby Harcros Chemical facilities, and by other responders trained according to the Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64 (Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities).  We have discussed our Risk Management Program with the West Point Fire Department and have coordinated emergency response with them.\n\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide at this facility is to minimize risk by reducing the overall travel time from our other Harcros distribution facilities to existing customers near this facility.  Harcros Chemicals will continue to participate in the Chlorine Institute and National Association of Chemicals Distributors programs, and continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.\n\nIn 2003, we developed a new security plan to help guard against intentional misuse of hazardous chemicals.  We are continuing to evaluate and implement new security measures by sharing knowledge with other Harcros facilities and general industry."
