Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the Fall River, Massachusetts facility per EPA Regulation 40 CFR Part 68.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nBlount Fine Foods is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Fall River Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPAA?s A?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia RefrigerationA?.
