      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary (5/2/2017)\n\n\n\nBuckman Laboratories, Inc. was established in 1945 as a manufacturer of specialty chemicals for aqueous industrial systems.  The company was founded on its unique ability to create and manufacture innovative solutions to control the growth of microorganisms. Today, Buckman Laboratories works with industry worldwide providing advanced chemical treatment technologies and extensive technical service to help solve complex industrial problems.  Our expertise spans a broad range of specialty chemicals, including microorganism control, scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, polymers dispersants and defoamers.  \n\n    \n\nBuckman Laboratories, Inc. finished products and raw materials are successfully applied in a number of industries, including pulp and paper, water treatment, agriculture, wood, leather, and coatings.\n\n    \n\nBuckman Laboratories, Inc. established the facility in Cadet, Missouri in the early 1960's.  The Cadet Plant manufactures several of the specialty chemicals mentioned above.  The manufacturing of these products requires the use of several raw material chemicals regulated by the EPA as regulated substances.  The regulated substances handled at the Cadet Plant include the following:\n\n    \n\n-Carbon Disulfide\n\n-Cyclohexylamine \n\n-Dimethylamine \n\n-Epichlorohydrin \n\n-Formaldehyde\n\n-Monomethylamine \n\n-Phosphorous Trichloride \n\n    \n\nManufacturing of the specialty chemicals occurs in the production area of the Cadet Plant, which contains 15 process vessels.  The process vessels are used to react and formulate the various specialty chemical products.  In addition to the process vessels, the manufacturing processes are supported by approximately 70 storage tanks, rail car loading and unloading stations, tanker truck loading and unloading stations, and various utility systems.\n\n    \n\nProduction processes are monitored and controlled by a Distributive Control System (DCS), an automated computer control system.  The DCS allows for the continuous monit"

The DCS is programmed to automatically correct or alarm these parameter deviations, allowing for the safe operation of the various production processes.  In addition to the DCS, highly trained Chemical Operators perform the day-to-day tasks required to safely operate the various processes.\n\n\n\nReferred to as the Golden Principle, Buckman Laboratories, Inc. believes that all occupational injuries and illnesses can be prevented. In addition, Buckman Laboratories has implemented and maintains the following Management Principles to continually guide daily activities:\n\n\n\n-Managers are ultimately responsible for safety of their people, their customers and the public.\n\n-Managers will seek involvement of their associates in the elimination of safety hazards in their workplace.\n\n-Safety education is vital to working safely.  Everyone must be trained again and again.\n\n-Good safety behavior is a condition of employment.\n\n-Safety will take precedence over expediency or short cuts.\n\n-Every attempt will be made to reduce the probability of incident occurrence.\n\n-Safeguards will be provided to ensure safe working conditions.\n\n-Safety audits are a must.  All deficiencies must be corrected promptly.\n\n-Where appropriate, safe standards will be set.  They should be reviewed annually.\n\n\n\nBuckman Laboratories, Inc. has implemented and maintains the following environmental policy:\n\n\n\nBuckman Laboratories, Inc. is committed to operating its facilities in a manner that is sustainable with the environment and the communities where we operate, while maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  Buckman recognizes that environmental matters are important in the operation of its business and that associates are 100% responsible for ensuring environmental protection.\n\n\n\nTo achieve these goals:\n\n-Top management provides the leade"

In addition to this rule, the Cadet Plant complies with various Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, which address accidental release prevention.  Specifically, Buckman Laboratories has established a Process Safety Management System for each of the regulated substances mentioned above.  In addition, Buckman Laboratories has also included several processes that involve reactive chemistries.  The Process Safety Management System complies with 29 CFR 1910.119 and the requirements of 40 CFR 68.\n\n    \n\nIn addition to the regulatory req"

      "SummaryText": "uirements, Buckman Laboratories has also installed an emergency release containment system to reduce the consequences of an accidental release.  The Process Vessels are equipped with systems to relieve pressures that may build up beyond design limits.  The relief systems consist of piping, which leads from each process vessel's pressure relief valve to a knock-out tank and quench tank.  These tanks allow for the containment of any released pressure and chemical vapor, thus, minimizing the potential release of regulated substances to the ambient air. \n\n    \n\nThe process areas and tank farm areas also have passive mitigation systems, such as liquid release containment systems.  These systems consist of diked areas, which would contain any spilled material and limit the effects on the environment.  The design of these diked areas reduces the total surface area of the spill, thus, reducing the evaporation rate of the spilled material.  In most cases, these diked areas may reduce the evaporation rate by a factor of 10, which reduces the distance to the endpoints associated with an accidental release.\n\n    \n\nChemical specific prevention steps have also been enacted and include the following:\n\n    \n\nPlant-wide:\n\n\n\n-Specially trained on-site Emergency Response Team which includes a Fire Brigade and Spill Response Team;\n\n-Ability to apply vapor and/or fire suppression foam;\n\n-Implementation of an effective Behavior-Based Safety program.\n\n    \n\nCarbon Disulfide: \n\n    \n\n-Use of a double-walled tank with a vacuum on the outer-shell to detect failure of tank;\n\n-Storage tank not vented to atmosphere; sealed vessel;\n\n-Individual liquid containment system (dike) constructed;\n\n-Overfill protection systems in place;\n\n-Maintenance of a water layer in dike area to act as a blanket on any released carbon disulfide (carbon disulfide is much heavier than water, tends to sink beneath water);\n\n-Installation of a liquid carbon disulfide detector in diked area to trigger a DCS alarm; \n\n-Limited use of flan"
