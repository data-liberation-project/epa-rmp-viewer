      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of Mattingly Foods Inc. to conduct business in a manner that is safe to the employees, the community and the environment.  The Company's officers, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Mattingly has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The Company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMattingly Foods is a packaged wholesale food distributor.  Ammonia refrigeration is used to cool or freeze food products.  Ammonia refrigeration is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.  Liquid ammonia is changed to a gas and then condensed for reuse.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nMattingly Foods has developed models of the releases at this facility and the potential affected areas.  EPA's RMP*Comp, was used to develop the models.\n\nThe worst-case release of ammonia involves the sudden failure of the Recirculator LTR - 1 when used as a storage vessel.  Depending on wind direction, residences and businesses at a distance of 0.8 mile could be affected.  This type release is not likely to occur because of the stringent construction codes for pressure vessels and annual inspections of the pressure vessels.\n\nThe alternative release of ammonia involves the failure of a 1 inch relief valve on the Condenser header, releasing 3,630 pou"

      "FacilityID": 27808,
      "SummaryText": "nds of ammonia gas over a thirty minute period.  Residences up to 0.1 mile from the release would be affected.  This release was selected because relief valves springs could fail if not maintained.  A periodic relief valve replacement program is  in place to prevent this type of accidental release from occurring.\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMattingly Foods has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies and materials requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMattingly Foods has not had an accidental release in the past five years resulting in offsite impact or extensive property damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe local fire department provides emergency response.   Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e. fire police, rescue, etc.) \n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include:  improved maintenance procedures and periodicity; addition of new technology as it becomes available; and continued training of plant and response personnel."
