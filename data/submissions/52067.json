The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is executed through Western Precooling Systems (WPS). The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of WPS - Driscoll to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their Response Action.\n\nThe Company recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. WPS - Driscoll policy includes development, maintenance and implementation of its Emergency Action Plan, and to train its employees in notification and evacuation procedures. WPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency response capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  Emergency response equipment is"

Emergency response pre-planning has been coordinated through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (CUPA in CA), including the submission of appropriate EPCRA Inventory Reports.  The company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training.\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWPS - Driscoll was remodeled and expanded in 2003; and provides for the cooling and short-term refrigerated storage of fresh fruits and vegetables. The facility went into operation early in April, 2003.  This is a 5-year update of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as required by Federal and State RMP Rules.  There have been no significant changes to the facility over that time-frame.\n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Oxnard.  Anhydrous Ammonia CAS # 7664-41-7 is used as the refrigerant in the main refrigeration system.  This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system which was installed in 2002-2003 according to the codes and standards locally adopted at that time.  The facility has obtained necessary operating permits from the City of Oxnard and City of Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  \n\nA portion of the refrigeration equipment is portable and is moved on & off-site according to seasonal produce markets.  The inter-connected piping between the portable components is permanently mounted.  Some vessels and evaporators within the refrigerated space are also permanently mounted.\n   \n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWPS is the company that operates and maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the site.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of"

      "SummaryText": " a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to teardown and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.   Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, WPS - Driscoll and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).    \n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established for the site.  In California the program is in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site RMP binder/or electronically via WBBM online RMP management system.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves were installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at all oil drain points.\n\nOther Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n?    Fencing and gates to limit access by potential ?wrong-do-ers?.\n?    Monitoring system monitors process parameters 24/7/365.  The alarm system is continuously monitored"

Staff is trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for un-authorized personnel, suspicious activity, fires, releases or other hazardous/suspicious condition.   \n?    Staff is trained in the fire and accident prevention benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n?

WPS - Driscoll worked closely with the CUPA in the planning and execution of the Plant and the refrigeration system.\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualified accidents.  There is no data to report.\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel that are not involved in the actual cooling process are trained to notify and evacuate.  Only personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards and the <LocalEmergencyResponder> would respond to an actual release. Written ammonia emergency action procedures are detailed in the WPS - Driscoll ?Thirty Minute Plan?. Available Emergency Response equipment is listed in the facility?s Contingency Plan; this plan and the ?Emergency Action Plan? detail procedures for non-responding personnel.  Each of these Plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis.  The Contingency Plan is filed with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  Updates are on a regular schedule.\n  \n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n?    Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n?    Compliance Audits;\n?    Routine maintenance"
