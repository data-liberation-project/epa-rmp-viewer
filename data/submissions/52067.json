The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to teardown and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.   Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, WPS - Driscoll and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).    \n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established for the site.  In California the program is in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site RMP binder/or electronically via WBBM online RMP management system.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves were installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at all oil drain points.\n\nOther Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\u00bf\tFencing and gates to limit access by potential \u00bfwrong-do-ers\u00bf.\n\u00bf\tMonitoring system monitors process parameters 24/7/365.
