One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is Toluene diisocyante (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS #  26471-62-5. Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spillage of, the contents of a TDI railcar into a designed and constructed subsurface concrete spill containment area.  The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model (ver. 5.4.1.2.) and resulted in the area of concern not affecting any public receptors.  The release rate, as calculated by the ALHOA model, was 0.0200 lbs./min.  \n\nIn addition to TDI (described above), the facility also utilizes methyl formate (CAS # 107-31-3) in the foam manufacturing process, which is stored on-site above the 10,000 lb. threshold. Using RMP*Comp to evaluate the worst case scenario (complete loss of the 8,000-gal tank) the model calculated a 0.6 mile distance to endpoint. Passive mitigation measures, including a concrete secondary containment, were factored into the model.  No residential, public or environmental receptors would be affected based on the modeling results.\n\nThis facility has an OSHA HAZWOPER trained Hazmat Team, which will provide initial response to any and all spills,"

If required, the assistance of the Fort Smith fire department will be requested.  This facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and the local fire department. All facility employees responsible for the handling of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in proper procedures as required by the USEPA, OSHA and DOT regulatory requirements.\n\nThere have been no accidents with regard to spillage of RMP substances at this facility within the last five years.\n\nNo changes to the procedures or methods of pollution prevention are to be made at this time.  Procedural changes may be implemented in the future if revaluation deems them necessary."
