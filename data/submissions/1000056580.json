The Water Treatment Plant is located on 20 acres next to the community of Sweeny Switch. This site is near the intersection of I37 and FM 534.  \n\n\n\nThe facility serves a population of approximately 12,863 according to the U.S. Census Bureau 2010 population estimate (www.census.gov). The facility contains six one-ton cylinders of chlorine.  Two one containers are connected to the system four tanks serve as reserve; consumption is approximately one cylinder per seven days.  There are eight (8) full-time employees at the site, personnel oversee the facility 24-hours a day and conduct daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatuses (SCBA) is stored in the Chemical Building. \n\n\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario, estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint. The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of the Chlorine to the air.  The quantity present in a vessel will be released as a gas over 10 minutes for toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or a liquid under pressure. The RMP*Comp32 results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach th"

      "SummaryText": "e toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 10-minute release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine is 1.3 miles. The total potentially affected population with the entire area of the circle is estimated at 149. \n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis, since chlorine is the only regulated toxic substance used at the facility. The scenario selected involves the rupture of the flexible connections to a one-ton container. This failure results in the release of the entire container's contents over a period of 15 minutes. This is equivalent to a release rate of 267 lbs. per minute. The RMP*Comp32 dispersion modeling results indicate that 0.3 miles is the maximum distance for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L). Though no population data was available through the Marplot program which utilizes latest U.S. Census Data (2010) a tour of the possible impacted area revealed 2 residences and a commercial business where an occupant resides. \n\n\n\nA search of MARPLOT Satellite and Topographic maps did identify one environmental receptor (Corpus Christi Lake State Park) within the endpoint of the worst case scenario.   Environmental receptors include natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas.\n\n\n\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at this facility.\n\n \n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) that operators wear during connection/disconnection of chlorine and staff awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine.\n\n\n\nTo comply with Prevention Program 3 and Process Safety Management requirements, George Morrill Water Treatment Plant personnel employed the HAZOP technique to conduct a Process Hazard Analysis.  All equipment was inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis. It was determined that the chlorination"

      "SummaryText": " facility was designed, built and operated in accordance with applicable codes and industrial guidelines. Continuous inspections as to the integrity and the condition process are made daily by George Morrill Water Treatment Plant personnel.\n\n\n\nThe City of Beeville emergency procedure addresses potential emergencies that can reasonably be expected to occur at the facility. Effort has been made to identify potential cause and consequence scenarios; however, it is possible that an event could occur that has not been foreseen. The Program Hazard Analysis and the Hazard Assessment are examples of this effort. The emergency procedure complies with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements. George Morrill Water Treatment Plant personnel are not the first responders, although the employees are trained in response techniques and notification of other first responders in the event of accidental chlorine releases.  The first responders are the Beeville Fire Department, mutual aid may be requested from Sweeny Switch Volunteer Fire Department and City of Mathis Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe City of Beeville has developed and implemented an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The City of Beeville Fire Department reviewed the facility's emergency response program. The Fire Departments is a member of the Bee County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually.\n\n"
