We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream is located at 3426 Wells Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana.  We manufacture some of the finest ice cream in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  Also located at the facility is raw milk processing equipment, shipping and receiving docks, and a waste water treatment equalization tank.  The facility produces and ships approximately 60 million gallons of finished product each year.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains in excess of 77,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Engineer and Emergency Response Facilitator.  The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 35 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe engineer determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted.  Also Edy's Grand Ice Cream Emergency Response Team is contacted.  The engineers then take appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Edy's Grand Ice Cream to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system. As part of ongoing on site training Edys trains with the local HAZMAT responders. \n\nEdy's Grand Ice Cream has organized the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library consisting of nine numbered volumes, some volume numbers are assigned to sets of reference manuals, such as Operation and Maintenance manuals.  This library also incorporates the use of videos and computerized tests.\n\nVolume I of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates mainly policies, the following policies are included in Volume I:\n\nEmployee Participation Guidelines: This policy outlines the commitment between management and employees to establish a program for a succes"

The production facility incorporates a standard evaporation and Compression Style Ammonia Refrigeration system.  Ammonia vapor from the Intercoolers is routed to the suction inlet of the High Stage Compressors.  \n\nAt the High Stage Compressors, ammonia vapor is compressed to a super heated vapor.  The super heated vapor is fed to the Evaporative Condensers.  At the Condensers the super heated vapor rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain.  The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils.  The condensers are equipped with Hydrostatic Relief valves that relieve around the isolation valves.  Airflow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to each condenser.\n\nWater from the Condenser Water Sump is pumped via the Condenser Pumps to the Evaporative Condensers.

The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils. The condensers are equipped with Hydrostatic Relief valves that relieve around the isolation valves.  Airflow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to the condenser.  Water is supplied to Condenser via a Water Pump. At the Condenser the water is forced through spray nozzles over the ammonia coils and then collected in a sump pan where it gravity drains back to the Condenser Water Sump and is recirculated back to the condensers.  As the water level of the Condenser Water Sump lowers it trips a Water Makeup Float which opens allowing water makeup to refill the Condenser Sump Tank.  The Condenser Water Sump is also equipped with an Ozone Generator for the control of contaminates in the water system.  A Sight Glass mounted on the Water Sump Tank allows the operator to see the correct water level in the sump tank. The Condensed Liquid Drain from the Evaporative Condenser gravity drains to the thermosyphon portion of the High Pressure Receiver. \n\nHigh Pressure Liquid gravity drains from the thermosyphon portion of the Receiver the Thermosyphon Oil Coolers of the Compressors.  At the Thermosyphon Oil Coolers on the Compressors the Liquid absorbs heat from the oil pumped through the Compressor.  As it absorbs heat it changes from a liquid to a Liquid/Vapor Combination, which is returned from the Thermosyphon Oil Coolers to the Thermosyphon Portion of the High Pressure Receiver, where the liquid and vapor is separated."

      "SummaryText": "The liquid being recirculated back out to the Compressors.  The Vapor is returned to the Evaporative Condenser, where it is re-condensed.  \n\nAs liquid accumulates in the Thermosyphon Portion of the Receiver it will overfill and gravity drain into the Receiver Portion of the Receiver where it is stored until needed. As Ammonia Liquid is needed in the system, it is fed (by pressure) from the Receiver through Liquid Filters and then used to feed several Evaporators and as Liquid Makeup to several vessels.\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid is fed to the Purger.  Purged Gas is piped from the Purge Points at Evaporative Condenser to the Purger. The Automatic Gas Purger separates the ammonia from the non-condensable by condensing the ammonia into a liquid.  Any non-condensable are piped to a Water Bubbler to remove any traces of ammonia. Condensed Vapor is piped back to the Low Temperature Recirculator.  \n\nHigh Pressure Liquid is also fed to Intercooler as liquid make-up. The Intercooler receives Booster Discharge from the Low Stage Compressors and cools the discharge before going to the High Stage Compressors. The liquid from the Intercooler is fed into the Low Temperature Recirculator.  \n\nHigh Pressure Liquid is also fed to two Suction Acculators LS-1 and LS-2 as liquid make-up. The Suction Accumulators provide for return of Low Temperature Recirculated Suction (gas/liquid combination) LTRS from the system on a continuous basis. The vapor returns through LSS to compressors. The liquid drops out into the vessels and gravity drains to Transfer Vessels LT-1 and LT-2. The vessels fill up and and the controls force hot gas into the transfer vessels forcing the ammonia liquid to transfer back to the High Pressure Receiver R-1.  \n\nHigh Pressure Liquid from the Filter Assembly is also fed to the Charging Room Evaporators. As the liquid is passed through the coil it absorbs heat from the air, changing from a liquid to a vapor. The Vapor from these Evaporators is piped back to the Intercoole"
