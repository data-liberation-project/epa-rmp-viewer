Midwest Renewable Energy also coordinates emergency response and preparedness activities with the LEPC and the Sutherland fire department. Employees and contractors are trained on emergency response procedures. Spill kits are available for use for small spills and denaturant receiving is conducted in a bermed area that provides containment in the event of a spill. Denaturant storage has secondary containment and if a spill occurs during rail loadout of denatured ethanol, then it would release into the existing containment area.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned Safety Improvements\r\nAs a result of the recent PHA update, Midwest Renewable Energy is in the process of evaluating updates to its"

      "SummaryText": "1.\tFacility Description and Regulated Substances\r\nThe facility currently receives grain and processes that grain into ethanol. Currently the facility utilizes one kind of grain - corn. The grain is received and stored in silos. As the grain leaves the silos, it is screened to remove debris and then is fed into hammer mills which grind the grain to flour. The flour is mixed with water and thin stillage from the distillation and evaporation systems to form a slurry mash. Enzymes are added to the mash and the mash is heated by steam to begin the conversion of corn starch into simple sugars. The mash is then cooled and pH is adjusted as needed. A second enzyme is added to convert the starch into glucose. The mash is then pumped to the fermentation tanks to begin the fermentation process. The fermentation process creates alcohol and carbon dioxide. Fermentation continues until all of the glucose has been broken down. At this point the mash contains 12 - 14 percent alcohol and is called beer. The carbon dioxide is vented into a scrubber which washes the carbon dioxide and any alcohol before it is vented to the atmosphere. The beer is then transferred from the fermenters to the beer well and is then sent to distillation to separate the alcohol from the corn solids and refine the alcohol. The alcohol and some water exits the top of the distillation process and is then dried to remove the remainder of the water. The resulting alcohol is 200 proof. The 200-proof alcohol is then mixed with natural gasoline as a denaturant to make it unfit for human consumption.\r\n\r\nMidwest Renewable Energy stores denaturant (natural gasoline) in above ground storage tanks. The denaturant contains isopentane and pentane which are subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. Midwest Renewable Energy is currently subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. Midwest Renewable Energy blends denaturant with ethanol in above ground storage"
