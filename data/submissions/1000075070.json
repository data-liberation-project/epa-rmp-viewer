We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented. \n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires that this site provide an executive summary in the RMP Plan.  This summary provides the following items:\n\nAccident Release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nDescription of stationary sources and regulated substances at facility\n\nOffsite Consequence analysis results\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\nFive year accident history\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nChemical Specific Prevention steps\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nArch has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Lake Charles facility purifies hydrazine/water solution into pure hydrazine mainly for use in the aerospace industry.  This is done through a small purification process which is maintained using OSHA, EPA and LDEQ standards.  In addition to the purification process ment"

The blending/shipping/storage equipment is maintained under the RMP standards.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n\n\nArch's worst case release scenario involves the complete failure of a blending vessel into a liquid containment area.  The scenario could result in public exposure however, this scenario does not account for any preventative or mitigating measures in place such as preventative maintenance procedures to prevent the failure and emergency response procedures to mitigate the effects of an emergency.\n\n\n\nArch has examined a series of alternative release scenarios where toxic chemicals could be released into the environment.  In the case of the alternate release scenarios, we examined the following releases:  The failure of a transfer hose during cargo tank unloading and the failure of a transfer hose during a process transfer.\n\n\n\nBoth of these scenarios did not impact areas outside the plant complex boundaries.  Only the cargo tank transfer scenario had a potential impact to a neighboring facility, depending on the wind direction.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at ARCH.  Because processes at the site are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation, they are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nArch encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and "

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each accident prevention element.  \n\n\n\nOne such element is our behavioral based safety techniques to change the basic structure of work.  This process has a mission to create a no-name no-blame environment that enables employees to change at-risk behaviors through education, observation analysis and feedback so all employees can enjoy an accident free workplace.\n\n\n\nA root cause analysis, which is done on incidents and near misses, then lead to action steps to implement which improve the safety and well-being of internal and external personnel and environment.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nArch keeps a variety of technical documents that contain key information which maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific personnel within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  These documents are available to employees upon request.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).

ARCH ensures the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nArch also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nArch has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nArch uses a combination of the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique along with a What-If checklist to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted by individuals with operating, maintenance and engineering expertise and facilitated by someone with PHA expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe findings of the PHA team are converted in action items/projects which are then assigned to the appropriate personnel.

The results and findings from these updates are documented, tracked and retained.  Once again, team findings are converted to action items and other projects for implementing the team's suggestions.\n\n\n\n    Operating Procedures\n\nArch maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The Management of Change process ensures operating procedures are updated as process changes are made.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Arch maintains key process parameter documents that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n    Training\n\nTo complement the written operating procedures, Arch has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees undergo a computer based training session. After successfully completing this training, the new employee undergoes an on-the-job training segment where the employee must demonstrate competency in certain job related skills.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Arch evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n    Pre-Startup Reviews (PSSR)\n\nPSSR are conducted for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\n    Mechanical Integrity\n\nArch has established procedures and practices to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
