The Plant is owned and operated by the Coachella Valley Water District (with a\r\nmailing address of P.O. Box 1058; Coachella, California 92236). The District's initial submittal for WRP No. 10 was made to USEPA and to the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health on June 21, 1999.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (also known as the Federal Risk Management Plan Regulations)and the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Article 3, Section 2745.3 (also known\r\nas the California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan - CalARP RMP Regulations). The scope of the Federal RMP and CalARP RMP includes all operations conducted at the Plant that involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine (i.e., chlorine is the only regulated substance handled at the Plant).\r\n\r\nPolicy Statement\r\nIt is the Policy of the Coachella Valley Water District (District) to conduct ALL District activities safely to prevent Job related accidents, illnesses, and injuries to employees and others and damage to District and Others'\r\nproperty. A well organized safety program provides a safe working environment and promotes increased efficiency at ALL levels (IIPP).\r\n\r\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe primary operation conducted at WRP No. 10 is the treatment of wastewater (NAICS Code 22132 - Sewage Treatment Facilities).\r\n\r\nWater Reclamation Plant No. 10 is a wastewater treatment plant that treats domestic wastes.

The Plant is also monitored 24-hours per day,7-days per week, 365-days per year at the District Headquarters located in Coachella. ALL chlorine storage,handling and use operations are conducted in-doors in a fully enclosed building that is equipped with an emergency scrubber.\r\n\r\nMaximum Inventory of Regulated Substances\r\nThe District's Maximum Inventory of Chlorine is 68,500-pounds (i.e., 32 one ton containers of chlorine with 8 online, 8 in standby, 16 maximum in storage AND a maximum of thirty 150-pound cylinders). The one ton containers are for use onsite while the 150-pound cylinders are for use at the domestic well sites (i.e., WRP No.\r\n10 is used as a storage facility for 150-pound cylinders that are used at the domestic well sites).\r\n\r\nSite Security\r\nIn order to ensure the security of the site, the District has erected a chain link fence around the entire site. Additionally, the site is equipped with a perimeter security system. Lastly, ALL building entries are equipped with intruder alarms to alert Control of unauthorized access. These site security provisions are intended to\r\nprevent unauthorized access to areas of the Plant where chlorine is stored, handled or used and seek to provide an added level of safety for the storage of chlorine at the Plant.\r\n\r\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release\r\nscenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\r\nthe worst case release; and an alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario). A number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal\r\nRMP/CalARP RMP Update. These scenarios were categorized into worst-case r"

Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\r\n\r\nCHLORINE\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios for Chlorine\r\nIn this scenario, one of the 32 one-ton containers of chlorine handled on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event. This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the chlorine storage building where the one ton containers are located). It is highly\r\nimprobable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event. However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded. This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely. In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 2,000-pounds of chlorine could be\r\nreleased (in the worst-case). The release of chlorine could occur either indoors or outdoors (during an accident involving the chlorine delivery truck). It was assumed that the chlorine released during the catastrophic accident was released outdoors forming a cloud of chlorine vapor which was assumed to freely migrate off-site. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 3.0-miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios for Chlorine\r\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 2000-pounds of chlorine. These scenarios include situations such as delivery of a leaking one-ton container of chlorine to the Plant, a pinhole leak in the chlorine\r\ntransfer piping, a partial or complete failure of the chlorine transfer lines (100-percent vapor) at various points in the system (in-doors), or the rupture or separation of the flexible connections from the online one-ton containers to the manifold system, or a leak from th"

In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 1447-pounds of chlorine was released (over a 60-minute period) during an accidental release involving the valve assembly on a one ton container. The resulting release of chlorine vapor would be fully contained within the chlorine storage building, resulting in the activation of the chlorine leak detectors and the subsequent automatic scrubbing of the building contents through the scrubber system. In the worst-case, if the scrubber were to fail, the release would be vented directly to atmosphere. Utilizing the methodology specified by USEPA, the estimated vulnerable zone for an accidental release of chlorine in this manner (i.e., directly to\r\natmosphere) is approximately 0.2 miles.\r\n\r\nES 3.0 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update, the Plant has NOT had any accidental releases of chlorine that have resulted in: Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\r\nKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nES 4.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION\r\nSTEPS/DEVICES\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the Plant consists of a series of programs, procedures and policies designed to minimize the risk of accidental releases involving chlorine.

These devices are located throughout the Plant and monitor various aspects of Plant Operations.\r\n\r\nAlarms and Emergency Scrubber\r\nWRP No. 10 is equipped with Leak Detectors that are designed to detect chlorine in the chlorine storage area at or above 1-ppm. When one of these detectors senses a gas leak at or above 1-ppm, a visual and audible alarm sounds locally, an alarm is indicated on the annunciator panel in the Control Room will activate and an alarm is transmitted to District Control at Headquarters. At 3-ppm the emergency scrubber activates - the scrubbing liquid recirculation pump come on and the exhaust fan will start to evacuate the room of building air (presumed to be contaminated with chlorine gas). The scrubber will continue to run until the detectors sense less than 1-ppm at which time these alarms can be reset and cleared. The alarms can only be reset and cleared locally and\r\nmanually. The alarms are tested by District Operators twice each month. Additionally, the District's Communications Shop inspects, tests and calibrates the chlorine alarm system on a monthly schedule.
