The primary SIC code for the operation is 2023; the NAICS code is 311514.  The facility is currently unoccupied however, the ammonia refrigeration system remains operational.  The system operates 24-hours/day, 7-day/week, 52-weeks/year in order to keep the cooler and freezer in service.  \n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The refrigeration system inventory at the facility exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia during the previous five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe system is monitored and inspected by contract technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The facility is unoccupied and the refrigeration system is operating at minimal l"

System operating parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe system has an integrated control that monitors critical operating parameters in real time.  The system control is programmed to notify the contract operating company immediately if an upset condition is detected.  The contract company always has a person on call to respond to the facility upon notification of an upset.  The system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with an early detection system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room and refrigerated spaces.  The system has an emergency shutdown station located outside the engine room.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This serves as the prevention plan required by RMP.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility i"

The facility has not experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place in the last five years.  Contractor personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia, in the event they should occur.\n\n\n\nThe facility has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  A release of 100 pounds or more must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.  The Fire Department will be provided with a copy of the facility's Emergency Action Plan upon request.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe prevention plan includes routine and periodic inspections and audits of the process and prevention programs to identify potential deficiencies.  The Process Hazard Analyses are conducted initially, as part of major additions or modifications and every five years to identify potential hazards in the process and provide recommendations to eliminate or reduce hazards and improve process safety and efficiency.\n\n"
