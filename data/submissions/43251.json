Sodium hypochlorite, commonly known \nas \u00bfbleach\u00bf, is manufactured by reacting liquefied chlorine with dilute caustic solution \nunder controlled conditions of temperature and pressure.\n\nAlong with many other segments of the American economy, Hasa recognizes there is a \nnew reality, which requires a heightened level of vigilance and increased communication \nwith law enforcement and security agencies.  Hasa has taken proactive measures to \nupgrade its security so that its products will continue to be manufactured, stored and \ntransported in a manner that protects the public\u00bfs health and safeguards our environment.\n\nChlorine has been part of our country\u00bfs public health defenses for over 100 years.
