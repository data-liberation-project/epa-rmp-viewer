      "SummaryText": "Facility Overview\n\nThe Crestwood Davisville, RI facility is a new, startup operation.  The facility has been used for similar operations by a different company in the past. \n\n\n\nThe operation involves staging railcars containing LPG on a rail siding within the fenced facility. A maximum of five railcars can be staged on the property. The cars are disconnected from the locomotive, and the locomotive leaves the property. The cars are unloaded into the storage tanks, then transferred into tank trucks, which then transport the product to customers. \n\n\n\nThere are five full time equivalent employees at this facility. Employees present on site are operational personnel. There are no maintenance personnel routinely on site. There are no contractors routinely present on site.\n\n\n\nEmergency Contacts\n\nThere is one Crestwood employee who serves as the primary emergency contact during off hours: the Senior Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Advisor. He can be reached 24 hours per day.\n\nEmergency planning has started with the local fire department and Office of Emergency Management.\n\nAn environmental cleanup company is under contract to provide additional assistance in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\n\nThe written employee participation plan outlines the various ways that employees are involved in the overall risk management plan. There is a copy of the written plan in the office. The Terminal Supervisor is charged with implementing the plan. The employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. An e-mail is sent to the employees as a reminder twice per year asking them for their suggestions and input for the risk management program. Additionally, the Terminal Supervisor maintains an open door policy, and the operators may make suggestions at any time. There is a daily \"tool box\" meeting covering environmental, safety, and health issues at which any questions or suggestions regarding risk management can be raised.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Informat"
