The facility was originally built in the 1970's and through expansions has increased its refrigeration process to where it has more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Golden Rod has implemented a Process Safety Management program to comply with OSHA regulations and the Risk Management Plan in compliance with the EPA.\n\n\n\nGolden Rod Senior Management Commitment\n\n\n\nGolden Rod is committed to safety and allocates resources to accomplish safety goals, for example:\n\n\n\nPurchasing safety equipment; hiring a consultant for assistance with safety and environmental matters, having full time managers on staff that have safety & environmental responsibility, conducting safety training for managers, supervisors and employees, training, equipping and maintaining emergency preparedness including a HAZWOPER team.\n\n\n\nGolden Rod Ammonia Refrigeration Department\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is operated by a trained full time refrigeration staff that includes 4 Refrigeration Technicians and 2 Refrigeration Supervisors.  The system is regularly monitored, inspected and maintained.  The refrigeration department utilizes preventative maintenance, standard operating procedures, regular and frequent inspections and safety programs.  \n\n\n\nSafety procedures include: lockout tagout, hot work permit, hazard communication, ammonia safety, respiratory protection, contractor control, opening system permits, hearing protection, fire prevention and protection, hazardous waste disposal, emergency response and maintenance procedures to ensure the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility is covered under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.110 Process Safety Management and EPA 40 Part 68 Risk Management Plan for having more than 10,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.
