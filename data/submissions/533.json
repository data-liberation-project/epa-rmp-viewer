The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Lee Fertilizer, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should anaccidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Faciltiy Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 85,000 pounds in the facility's single tank.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 85,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the rail car.  The distance to the endpoin of dispersion based on the model used is 2.23 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario is assumed to be a release from the ruprure of a one inch transfer hose, with 2901 pounds released as a gas over two minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.64 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers, and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries,"

      "SummaryText": "or significant property damage on site: nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and communioty the right to know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
