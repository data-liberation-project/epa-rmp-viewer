In the event that an\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s) Emergency\nResponse Personnel, and other appropriate authorites deemed applicable depending on the specific\nincident, to best mitigate any; release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and to \nenvironment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 493l3, \"Farm product storage and warehousing\nfacility\", however, we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving,\nstorage, and reloading of Anhydrous Amonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  This product is\nsubject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. Only the facility used for\nthis product will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Amonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the \nearly spring and late fall months.  During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored only with\nlittle if any product transfers taking place.  The maximum quantity stored had been listed earlier in the\nRMP and will not be disclosed in this summary.  Maximum quantity handled at a given time will be the \nunloading of a semi-trailer tank.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as need\" basis with staff present during the receiving and loading of \nproduct for delivery.  Annual hours for these do not meet the 2080 hour requirement to qualify as a \n\"full time employee\" on site; therefore, item number 1.11 is zero.  Our facility has adequate lighting, and\nis inspected day and night during use, and through out the \"off season\".\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest  Anhydrous\nAmmonia tank released as a gas over 10"

The maximum quantity released has been indentified\nearlier in this program and would effect some residential population.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nWe have not had an actual release of anhydrous amonia during the last 5 years at this site so believe\nthe most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected\nby manual, self-closing excess flow, and  \"pull away\" valves.  Our alternative release scenario is \nbased on the loss of contents from the largest hose used for unloading the transportation tanks.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM;\n\nOur accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is based on guidelines found in the American\nNational Sandard Institute (ANSI) \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\nAmmonia,\" and the Occupational Safey and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR l910.111\n\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  Additionally, we conduct annual employee training\non the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed \nsafety equipment including but not limited to: Excess flow valves, Breakaway couplers at risers,\nEmergency shut-off valves, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We \nmaintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel, and have \nprovided and/or participate in safety training exercises on Anydrous Ammonia.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nWe have not had a release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years that has caused death,\ninjury, or significant property damage at the facility.  To our knowledge, we have not caused any \noffsite death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility is included in the written Community Emergency Response Plan as prepared by the Local\nEmergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).\nWe also in"
