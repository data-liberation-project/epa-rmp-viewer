              "Description": "SWRC is a Program Two facility in which it must demonstrate compliance with seven elements that are the foundation of the accidental release prevention program.  These seven elements include: safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and accident investigation.  SWRC complies with Program Two requirements.\n\nSeasonal (May through October of each year) effluent disinfection is a requirement of the Springbrook Water Reclamation Centers (SWRC) NPDES permit.  Chlorine gas is used as the disinfecting agent. The NPDES permit also requires removal of residual chlorine prior to discharge to the receiving stream.  This is accomplished with sulfur dioxide gas. \n\nChlorination (Disinfection) Process #1\n\nNine one-ton containers of gaseous chlorine are stored in the chlorine room (six one-ton sulfur dioxide containers are stored in the adjacent SO2 room). Six of the nine containers of chlorine are connected with approved flexible feed lines to two separate gas feed manifolds.    Note:  The chlorine and SO2 feed systems are virtually identical.\n\nBeyond the ends of the flexible lines, all pressurized gas piping is Chlorine Institute- specified 3,000 psi black steel which was assembled using chlorine/SO2 compatible pipe joint compound.  The gas from the containers connected to each half of the manifold passes through a feed line shut-off valve, a Wallace & Tiernan 1 gas strainer, a Wallace & Tiernan pressure/vacuum regulator/automatic switchover unit and finally to a Wallace & Tiernan pressure check/pressure relief unit.  When the automatic switchover unit for one manifold of three containers senses a loss of gas pressure in its manifold indicating its containers are empty, it closes, causing the other pressurized manifold to go into service.  Beyond the outlet of the pressure check/pressure relief unit, the gas is no longer under pressure.  It is drawn through the remainder of the system by a vacuum that has been induced by two Wallace & Tiernan gas ejectors.  These units produce a vacuum by the action of a high velocity flow of water passing over an orifice in each unit.  A minimum 50 psi water supply is provided by the plant nonpotable service water system. The gas is drawn to two Wallace & Tiernan model V-500, V-Notch brand gas feeders.  One of the units is manually controlled, the other automatically feeds in proportion to the effluent flow rate.  For feeding chlorine, the manual gas feeder is adjusted to provide a fixed feed rate and the automatic unit is adjusted to meet the remaining chlorine demand. The gas is drawn to the previously mentioned ejectors where it is blended with nonpotable plant service water to form a solution.  The chlorine solution, which is under pressure from the plant service water system, passes through piping to the inlet end of the two chlorine contact tanks where flash mixers blend it with the effluent from the treatment process.  The serpentine path through the chlorine contact tanks provides a contact time of thirty minutes at a flow rate of 22.5 MGD.\n\nThere are two Fisher & Porter Chloralert detectors that sense the presence of chlorine gas in the air in the chlorine rooms.  One unit is located in the room where the one-ton containers are stored and the chlorinators are located.  The other is in the MCC room where the gas enters the ejectors and the chlorine solution lines are located.  The on-line monitoring and detection devices and alarms are continuously tested and maintained.\n\nOne-ton chlorine containers are moved with an industry specified electrically-operated overhead trolley/crane/lifting beam system. As the containers are moved into position for use they are positioned with their valves perpendicular to the floor to provide gas feed from the top valve on each container and liquid feed from the bottom valve. After being properly positioned the containers are held in place by a series of chocks on the floor.  Full and empty containers are marked with large, reusable magnetic tags.\n\nAll the containers and equipment are rated for the safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and compositions.  The building and equipment all meet industry specifications, codes and standards and are also designed in compliance with Federal, State, and local design codes and standards.  The storage building is designed to provide passive mitigation containment in the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas.  There are no active mitigation systems.\n\nCl2 Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are available at several SWRC locations as required by 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g). MSDS information is reviewed annually and SWRC staff receive yearly MSDS training. SWRC staff routinely reviews the hazards associated with chlorine and the chlorination process and have determined scenarios for equipment malfunctions or human errors which could result in an accidental release as well as establishing safeguards to prevent them.\n\nThe procedures for disconnecting and reconnecting one-ton containers, as well as normal and emergency start-up and shut-down of the chlorination process are detailed step-by-step in SWRCs operations manual and are included in the on-site RMP. Chlorine  operations are always performed by two trained personnel working as a safety team wearing self-contained breathing apparatus.\n\nAll Wastewater Operations and Wastewater Maintenance personnel have received training about  chlorine hazards, chlorine handling, and chlorine container and equipment repair.  They receive annual refresher training on these subjects, as well.  In addition, a chlorine gas leak drill was conducted with local emergency responders in October 1995.\n\nChlorine system maintenance includes completely dismantling and rebuilding the Wallace & Teirnan V500 chlorinators to manufacturers specifications (training provided by the manufacturer), gas feed systems are dismantled and inspected annually and rebuilt or replaced as necessary, gas ejectors are tested annually and gas leak detectors and related alarms for the chlorine system are tested twice weekly.\n\nThis is SWRCs first RMP therefore a compliance audit is not required.",

              "Description": "SWRC is a Program Two facility in which it must demonstrate compliance with seven elements that are the foundation of the accidental release prevention program.  These seven elements include: safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and accident investigation.  As mentioned previously, SWRC complies with Program Two requirements.\n\nSeasonal (May through October of each year) effluent disinfection is a requirement of the Springbrook Water Reclamation Centers (SWRC) NPDES permit.  Chlorine gas is used as the disinfecting agent. The NPDES permit also requires removal of residual chlorine prior to discharge to the receiving stream.  This is accomplished with sulfur dioxide gas. \n\nDechlorination Process #2\n\nSix one-ton sulfur dioxide containers are stored in the SO2 room (nine one-ton containers of gaseous chlorine are stored in the adjacent chlorine room.  Four of the six SO2 containers are connected with approved flexible feedlines to two separate gas feed manifolds.    Note:  The chlorine and SO2 feed systems are virtually identical.\n\nBeyond the ends of the flexible lines, all pressurized gas piping is Chlorine Institute- specified 3,000 psi black steel which was assembled using chlorine/SO2 compatible pipe joint compound.  The gas from the containers connected to each half of the manifold passes through a feed line shut-off valve, a Wallace & Tiernan 1 gas strainer, a Wallace & Tiernan pressure/vacuum regulator/automatic switchover unit and finally to a Wallace & Tiernan pressure check/pressure relief unit.  When the automatic switchover unit for one manifold of two containers senses a loss of gas pressure in its manifold indicating its containers are empty, it closes, causing the other pressurized manifold to go into service.  Beyond the outlet of the pressure check/pressure relief unit, the gas is no longer under pressure.  It is drawn through the remainder of the system by a vacuum that has been induced by two Wallace & Tiernan gas ejectors.  These units produce a vacuum by the action of a high velocity flow of water passing over an orifice in each unit.  A minimum 50 psi water supply is provided by the plant nonpotable service water system. The gas is drawn to two Wallace & Tiernan model V-500, V-Notch brand gas feeders.  One of the units is manually controlled, the other automatically feeds in proportion to the effluent flow rate.  For feeding SO2, an automatic gas feeder is used with a manual unit remaining in a standby mode.  The gas is drawn to the previously mentioned ejectors where it is blended with nonpotable plant service water to form a solution.  The SO2 solution is piped to a point in the effluent discharge line downstream of the chlorine contact tanks where it is injected into the chlorinated effluent, effectively neutralizing any remaining chlorine.  \n\nSulfur dioxide leak detection is provided by an Enterra Tox-Alarm that is located in the single room where all of the SO2 equipment is located.  The on-line monitoring and detection devices and alarms are continuously tested and maintained.\n\nOne-ton SO2 containers are moved with an industry specified electrically-operated overhead trolley/crane/lifting beam system.  As the containers are moved into position for use they are positioned with their valves perpendicular to the floor to provide gas feed from the top valve on each container and liquid feed from the bottom valve.  After being properly positioned the containers are held in place by a series of chocks on the floor.  Full and empty containers are marked with large, reusable magnetic tags.\n\nAll the containers and equipment are rated for the safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and compositions.  The building and equipment all meet industry specifications, codes and standards and are also designed in compliance with Federal, State, and local design codes and standards.  The storage building is designed to provide passive mitigation containment in the event of an accidental release of sulfur dioxide.  There are no active mitigation systems.\n\nSO2 Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are available at several SWRC locations as required by 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g).  MSDS information is reviewed annually and SWRC staff receive yearly MSDS training. SWRC staff routinely reviews the hazards associated with sulfur dioxide and the dechlorination process and have determined scenarios for equipment malfunctions or human errors which could result in an accidental release as well as establishing safeguards to prevent them.\n\nThe procedures for disconnecting and reconnecting one-ton containers, as well as normal and emergency start-up and shut-down of the dechlorination process are detailed step-by-step in SWRCs operations manual and are included in the on-site RMP. Sulfur dioxide  operations are always performed by two trained personnel working as a safety team wearing self-contained breathing apparatus.\n\nAll Wastewater Operations and Wastewater Maintenance personnel have received training about sulfur dioxide hazards, sulfur dioxide handling, and sulfur dioxide container and equipment repair.  They receive annual refresher training on these subjects, as well.\n\nSulfur dioxide system maintenance includes completely dismantling and rebuilding the Wallace & Teirnan V500 chlorinators to manufacturers specifications (training provided by the manufacturer), gas feed systems are dismantled and inspected annually and rebuilt or replaced as necessary, gas ejectors are tested annually and gas leak detectors and related alarms for the SO2 system are tested twice weekly.\n\nThis is SWRCs first RMP therefore a compliance audit is not required.",

      "SummaryText": "The City of Naperville's Springbrook Water Reclamation Center (SWRC) is an advanced wastewater treatment facility which has a mechanically aerated activated sludge process incorporating single-stage nitrification, tertiary filtration, chlorination/dechlorination, and biosolids processing.  Originally constructed in 1975 as a 10.0 million gallons per day (MGD) contact stabilization facility, SWRC underwent expansions in 1985, 1990, and 1995 bringing the plant to  the current design average flow of 22.5 MGD.  SWRC presently uses gaseous chlorine for process chlorination (disinfection) of treated wastewater effluent and sulfur dioxide for effluent dechlorination prior to discharge into the DuPage River. These chemicals are widely used for industrial applications, as well as pollution control purposes, and they are an integral part of everyone's daily lives. They are transported on roads, waterways, and railways. As part of our wastewater treatment process, chlorine disinfects our treated wastewater effluent prior to discharge into the DuPage River to protect individuals who use the river for recreational purposes. Chlorine also purifies our drinking water, disinfects our swimming pools, and can be truly life saving. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children worldwide die every day from waterborne diseases resulting from the lack of a water disinfection agent such as chlorine. Although chlorine is very beneficial and fundamentally necessary in protecting public health, it must be removed from our effluent after a 30-minute disinfecting period. This is required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prevent possible adverse effects of chlorine on  waterways and their ecosystems. All traces of chlorine in SWRCs effluent are removed by using sulfur dioxide gas in solution, injected prior to effluent discharge. \n\nStoring and using gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide does involve the potential hazard of accidental release into the surrou"

We take our safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we dedicate our goals towards the best possible wastewater treatment for environmental and public health protection. The storage quantities of these chemicals are above the regulatory threshold limits of 1500 lbs and 2500 lbs respectively as listed in Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act of 1990.  As a result, SWRC must comply with the 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements and submit an RMP to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency by the June 21, 1999 deadline.  It should be noted that SWRC will need to comply with RMP requirements for only the current May 1, 1999 - October 31, 1999 chlorination/dechlorination period.  Construction will begin soon for the new liquid chlorination/dechlorination process to replace our existing gaseous systems during the current two-phase treatment plant expansion to 30 MGD. This new chlorination/dechlorination process will use liquid sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite and is expected to be fully operational by May 1, 2000.  Once this system is fully operational, gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide will no longer be used and SWRC will not be required to maintain an RMP.  Following the startup of this new system, SWRC will submit a notification of de-registration to the IEPA.\n\nModeled after OSHA PSM requirements for industries, the RMP regulations require that a hazard assessment be performed to determine the impacts of accidental release of  a facilitys hazardous compounds to the public.  Although these are extremely unlikely events, the RMP further ensures the prevention of accidental release due to additional requirements  such as hazard identification and assessment,  computer modeling of different accidental release scenarios, a five-year history of accidental release, a comprehensive management program for prevention of accidental release, and an emergency operations program in the event of an accidental releas"

      "SummaryText": "e.\n\nSWRCs RMP identifies the two hazardous chemicals, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, as being above the Section 112 (r)  threshold quantities.  Currently, SWRC stores and utilizes a maximum of nine one-ton cylinders of gaseous chlorine (18,000 lbs) and six one-ton cylinders of gaseous sulfur dioxide (12,000 lbs).  These chemicals are stored in a non-venting building which provides passive mitigation (physical and structural chemical containment) in the event of an accidental release.  In addition, SWRC uses several process safety controls which are electronically and mechanically designed to prevent accidental release of these gases.  These include manually-controlled vents, relief valves, check valves, manual/automatic shutoff systems, interlocks, gas detectors and alarms. \n\nRMP requirements include worst case and alternative release scenarios to be determined using EPA-approved computer models.  The definition of a  worst case scenario is the accidental release of the entire contents of one cylinder  over a period of 10 minutes during calm weather conditions.  An alternative release scenario includes passive and active mitigation systems for chemical containment.  The computer model DEGADIS Breeze Version 3.1 determined a worst case scenario of the accidental release of the entire contents of one cylinder of sulfur dioxide.  The modeling indicated an impact of 1.91 mile radius and exposure for 4830 people.  It should be noted that a worst case scenario is an extremely unlikely event and does not take into account SWRCs  process safety features and equipment which are designed to prevent the accidental releases of  these chemicals outside the storage building and off-site to surrounding residential areas.  More realistic alternative release scenarios of both chemicals by DEGADIS computer modeling indicated  their toxic endpoints (0.22 mile radius for chlorine and 0.20 mile radius for sulfur dioxide) fall just a few feet outside SWRCs property line "

SWRC staff have always practiced a comprehensive program regarding chlorine and sulfur dioxide management, safety and training.  As a result, SWRC never had an accidental release of either one of these chemicals causing an impact on human health or the surrounding environment during the 24-year history of this wastewater treatment plant.\n\nEach of the facilities required to follow the RMP rule will fall under one of three RMP Programs.  Program One facilities have hazardous chemicals on-site but have no off-site public receptors and have the least amount of RMP requirements.  Program Three requirements are the most comprehensive and apply to those facilities which tend to be large industries, may have a five-year history of accidental release of hazardous chemicals, or are required to follow OSHA PSM requirements.  SWRC is a Program Two facility in which it must demonstrate compliance with seven elements that are the foundation of the accidental release prevention program.  These seven elements include safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and accident investigation.  As mentioned previously, SWRC complies with Program Two requirements.\n\nSWRC also has an Emergency Operations Program in the remote event of an  accidental release of chlorine  or sulfur dioxide gas.  This program includes the emergency procedure to notify the Naperville Fire Department Hazmat Team to respond to the emergency and  contain the gaseous leak and initiate repairs to the leakage area.  The Hazmat team is HAZWOPER trained and certified.  In addition, our Emergency Operations Program includes designation of key personnel and departments needed to coordinate, direct, and manage an accidental release emergency, an evacuation plan, a step-by-step emergency operations procedur"

A chlorine leak drill at SWRC was conducted by SWRC personnel, the Naperville Police and Fire Departments, the Naperville Emergency Management Agency, and the Will County Office of Emergency Management during the fall of 1995.  The results of this drill indicated that the Emergency Operations Program was effective in allowing responders to quickly assess the extent of the emergency, evacuate the immediate area, stop leakage and make necessary repairs.\n\nSWRC staff recognizes the importance of public awareness and education regarding the on-site storage and use of hazardous gases and the possible risk to the surrounding community and will address these issues as needed. In addition, the local emergency planning committee and local emergency responders will continue to be routinely updated on chemical inventories, safety management and training, and emergency response procedures. It is our goal that the community understands the purpose of the RMP, the hazard assessment of SWRCs chlorine and sulfur dioxide and possible risk to the surrounding areas.  It must be emphasized to the public that the odds of an alternative release scenario occurring at SWRC is extremely unlikely;  a worst case  release scenario is even more remote.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, SWRCs passive mitigation system, safety equipment and gas monitors in the chlorine/sulfur dioxide building would prevent a gas release outside the storage building itself and over SWRCs property line. SWRC staff would quickly respond to a gas leak by notification to emergency responders and activating the Emergency Operations Program.
