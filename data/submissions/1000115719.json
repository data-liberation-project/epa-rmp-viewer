      "SummaryText": "The Fletcher Mine and Mill is part of The Doe Run Company's Southeast Missouri Mining & Milling Organization (SEMO).  The regulated substance used at this facility is anhydrous (water-free) sulfur dioxide.  It is delivered to the mill via a tanker truck and stored as a liquid under pressure in a horizontal carbon steel tank.  The tank has a maximum capacity of 145,300 pounds SO2.  Tank volume is typically maintained at less than 75% capacity, 109,000 lb.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used in the benefication of copper-bearing ore. Sulfur dioxide vapor is fed to the copper circuit at a rate controlled to maintain an acceptable pH of process solutions. This aids the separation of copper bearing material from the other components of the solution. Sulfur dioxide is used because it is the most effective and cost-efficient reagent for this purpose.  \n\nCertain safety precautions must be observed when handling and storing sulfur dioxide to prevent human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, to reduce the hazard to nearby members of the surrounding communities, and to reduce the threat to the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, state and local rules and regulations. \n\nAccess to the mill facilities is restricted to authorized company employees and authorized contractors, and visitors.\n\nThere have been no sulfur dioxide accidents or incidents with adverse onsite or offsite consequences.  \n\nThe Doe Run Company maintains a strong corporate commitment to employee safety. \n\nEmployee training, both formal and informal, and facility maintenance activities are conducted routinely.\n\nThe facility has recently updated its emergency response plan.  This plan addresses: Potential Health Effects; Notifications of Regulatory Agencies, Emergency Responders, the Public, and Doe Run Personnel; Emergency Medical Treatment; Emergency Response, Minor Leak (Odor and Impact at Leak Site Only), Major Release (Visible Emission or Liqu"
