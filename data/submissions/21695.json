      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Manufacturing:\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Food Services of Arkansas, LLC are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such as release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Little Rock Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements is 13,500 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst Case Analysis:\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from the Sysco Food Services of Arkansas, LLC Ammonia (anhydrous) system.  The scenario involves a release of 13,500 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 1,350 and a distance to endpoint of .7 miles is obtained which effects a residential population of 305"

This scenario involves the release of 1700 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 170 and a distance to endpoint of .1 miles is obtained which effects a residential population of 43.\n\nThere are no Flammables Worst-Case or Alternative-Case analysis for this facility.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.
