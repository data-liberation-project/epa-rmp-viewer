This Wastewater Treatment plant is rated at 6 million gallons per Day with an average daily flow of 3.6 million gallons per day. This Treatment plant is a secondary activated sludge plant with anaerobic sludge digestion.  The area served by this Treatment plant includes the City of Poulsbo, town of Silverdale, Bangor and Keyport Military bases and the surrounding areas. One ton chlorine cylinders are used as an odor control agent for the incoming wastewater streams. One ton and 150 # cylinders of chlorine are stored at the Central Kitsap Tr. Plant for use at outlying Kitsap County Public Works lift station and treatment plants.\nDuring normal operations a total of four full one ton cylinders with one cylinder on line and three as spares may be present. Up to fifteen one hundred and fifty # cylinders which are stored but are not used at the Central Kitsap Tr. Plant, may be present at any one time. These cylinders are used at offsite  stations.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies available to the employees at the Central Kitsap Treatment plant include:\n\nRelated Policies contained in the Kitsap County Public Works Safety Manual, Revised 10 -98.\n\nAfter Normal Working Hours Duty List - Standard Operating Procedures.\nChlorine Leaks - Standard Operating Procedures\nLock out- Tag out, The Policy\nConfined Space, The Policy\nRespiratory Protection, The Policy\nAll these documents are written at the direction of Randy Casteel, Director of Public Works.\nChemical Hazard Communications\nIncludes Department of Labor and Industries Guidelines\nWAC 296-62-054 through WAC 296-62-05425.\n\n*The Worst Case Scenarios for the Central Kitsap Treatment Plant\nThis would be a chlorine gas release f"

The chlorine leak detector senses a chlorine leak and the auto dailer calls out the on call personnel. During this  time that it takes for the on call personnel to arrive, which is approximately 10 to 20 minutes, the public which is down wind in the south direction has called the fire department with a complaint of  a smell of chlorine in the air. On call personnel will work with fire department personnel and the local emergency response personnel to alert down wind residents which are located in the down wind quadrant using the program designed by the Kitsap County Public Works personnel. State patrol and the fire department personnel will monitor roads and control traffic in the area. Areas affected would mainly be residential, some recreational areas and small businesses due to the time of night. \nWorst case scenarios for Central Kitsap Tr. Plant gas release are reduced by checking chlorine tanks, gas piping and detectors and telemetry twice a day. The chlorine and telemetry equipment is on a data base  monitored by a periodic maintenance program. Personnel use this program which takes the manufacturers' maintenance recommendations for a piece of equipment and use the information to perform maintenance in a timely fashion. The chlorine cylinders are checked by the chlorine supply company on a regular basis.\n\n7 The alternative scenario for the Central Kitsap Tr. Plan\nThe Central Kitsap Tr. Plant is manned 24 hours a day during the winter months (October through March).\nThe Late night maintenance worker receives an alarm from the chlorine leak detector, calls for on site help from the on call personnel.
