This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transloading system only, including the associated piping and twenty (20) storage tanks (detached railcars).\r\n\r\nThe Omega Partners - Jacksonville Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. This butane transloading system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (TRI-FLO Inc.) instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\r\n\r\nThis is a new facility; therefore, it has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or shelterings in-place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Omega Partners - Jack"
