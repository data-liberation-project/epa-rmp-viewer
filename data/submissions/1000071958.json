Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \n\nBolthouse Farms has a deep concern for the protection of the environment, since through our daily operations we know the importance of clean surroundings. The company has always made an honest effort to preserve the natural environment and will continue to strive towards improving our efforts in all forms of pollution control; be it water, air, solids, or noise. \n\n\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in the facility safety program. Bolthouse Farms takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, and a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel. \n\n\n\nThe Facility Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program. \n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nBolthouse Farms' Prosser facility produces fresh vegetables for sale to the public. The facility operates ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling for the vegetables produced. Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Prosser facility. \n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation. The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements: \n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation Program \n\n?    Process Safety Information \n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis \n\n?    Operating Procedures \n\n?    Training Program \n\n?    Contractor Safety Program \n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures \n\n?    Mechanical Integrity Program \n\n?    Hot Work Permit "
