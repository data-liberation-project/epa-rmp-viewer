      "SummaryText": "The management of Louisiana Generating LLC, owner and operator of Big Cajun 2 Power Plant, is committed to safe and environmentally sound operation of the plant.  Big Cajun 2 Power Plant is a three-unit coal-fired power plant located on a 2000-acre site near New Roads, Louisiana on the Mississippi River.  The mission of the power plant is to produce electricity for the 11 electric cooperatives located throughout Louisiana.  The plant burns Wyoming sub-bituminous coal in its boilers, and utilizes Mississippi River water for cooling and boiler make-up water.\n\nBig Cajun 2 Power Plant is dedicated to a safe working environment.  A Corporate Safety Policy was instituted in 1983, and was revised in 1992.  A Safety Manual is provided to each employee of the plant.  Management incorporates training in safe-handling practices of hazardous materials and in fire-fighting techniques on a regular basis.  The Training Department provides Hazard Communications (HazCom) and Emergency Response Team (ERT) training.    \n\n\nChemical Processes Covered by This Risk Management Plan\n\nChlorine is the only substance utilized at this facility that is regulated under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program requirements in 40 CFR Part 68.  Chlorine is used in the pretreatment of water, and in cooling towers located on-site.  Chlorine is delivered to the site in one (1)-ton cylinders.  Each cylinder is transferred by the delivery driver from the delivery truck and positioned on its side in a Bulk Storage Rack.  Two Bulk Storage Racks are located on-site in well-ventilated areas that require minimal exposure to personnel.  The locations of the two racks are the Circulating Water Chlorination Process area and Water Pretreatment Chlorination Process area.   \n\nAt the Circulating Water Chlorination Process area, the storage rack holds up to twelve 1-ton cylinders.  The function of this process is to add chlorine to the Circulating Water System intermittently (2 hours p"

The chlorinator can supply chlorine at a rate of 4000 lb/day.  At this location, only one (1) chlorine container is in service at any time.  Visual and audible alarms are provided for the Circulating Water Chlorination system and are acknowledged in the Unit 3 Control Room.  The alarms alert emergency personnel when triggered by the detection of chlorine gas (Chloralert system) and/or the detection of pressure and temperature changes in the process.\n\nThe second chlorine storage rack is located in the Water Pretreatment Chlorination Process area.  At this location, the storage rack holds up to six (6) cylinders.  The function of the Pretreatment Chlorination System is to supply chlorine continuously to the River Water Header to prevent or retard the growth of water-philous bacteria and algae in three clarifiers.  The system also includes two small, separate gaseous chlorinators, each rated to supply chlorine at about 100 lb/day.  Only one (1) chlorine container is in service at each chlorinator at any time. \n\nAny major or minor maintenance to the chlorinators is performed by a factory certified vendor, under the supervision of water systems operator.  The vendor qualifications are scrutinized by the PSM team, Safety and Securities department.  A buddy system is used for maintenance or changing chlorine cylinders.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe guidance used to determine the worst-case chlorine release scenarios for each of the two covered processes was provided by the EPA in its Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis document (April 1999) and in its instructions for use of the RMPComp\u00bf model.  Based on the model\u00bfs calculation of the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release of chlorine, the area surrounding the plant that could potentiall"

The plant has an on-site safety training facility and one full-time on-site training personnel.  \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years, Big Cajun 2 Power Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant damage on site or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage for the covered processes.\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nBig Cajun 2 Power Plant trains personnel in HazCom and fire-fighting methods.  Incident Commander training has been conducted, and ERT personnel are on-site 24 hours per day.  Personnel assigned to the ERT receive a minimum of one hour of training per month on various safety items, and eight hours of training per year in fire fighting.  \n\nA public address system is located throughout the plant site.  An audible alarm sound followed by verbal communication will alert the ERT.  Alarms located at the Circulating Water Chlorination Process and Pretreatment Chlorination Process areas will alert personnel of a possible chlorine leak.\n\nThe Shift Supervisor on duty at the plant serves as an Incident Commander for emergency response.  An equipment operator routinely inspects the plant and all equipment every two hours during all shifts of each day of the year and reports to the shift supervisor of any abnormal or suspect conditions, including chlorine process leaks.\n\nBig Cajun 2 personnel have coordinated emergency response procedures for chlorine releases with the Pointe Coupee Local Emergency Planning Committee, which is headed by the Pointe Coupee Sheriff\u00bfs Office."
