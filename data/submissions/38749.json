Pursuant to this commitment, the City makes every effort to operate the wastewater treatment facilities in a safe manner, in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and according to established good engineering and management principles.  \n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge North Wastewater Treatment Plant (NWWTP) was designed by qualified and experienced engineers and all operating personnel received the necessary training for the safe operation of the plant.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n\n\n\nThe NWWTP receives domestic wastewater from the north side of the City?s urban perimeter including the Southern University campus, and provides secondary treatment to this wastewater.  Before being discharged into the Mississippi River, the treated effluent is disinfected with chlorine and further treated with sulfur dioxide for removal of the residual chlorine.  The use of these two chemicals makes the NWWTP subject to the provisions and requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n\nChlorine.  The NWWTP has two 5,000-gallon storage tanks (nominal size) to satisfy the chlorine needs of the wastewater disinfection process.  Each tank?s working capacity is limited, by means of administrative controls, to a maximum of approximately 4,000 gallons, or no more than 50,000 lb. of liquid chlorine.  This chemical is delivered on the plant site by dedicated tanker trucks operated by the chlorine supplier.  All of the chlorine storage and handling facilities are enclosed inside a steel-frame and concrete building.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide.  The NWWTP receives sulfur dioxide in one-ton cylinders which are "

The cylinders are stored inside the sulfur dioxide building, a steel-frame and concrete structure that also houses all of the major components of the dechlorination system.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 includes, among other items, the development of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for the possible release of significant quantities of the regulated toxic substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide).  Originally, these requirements also called for the Executive Summary (ES) to include a discussion of the WSC and ARS for each toxic chemical.\n\n\n\nPer the above, the ES of the original RMP submitted to the USEPA in 1999 presented and discussed these scenarios and the hypothetical offsite consequences in some detail.  Considering that the operation of these systems have not undergone any changes that would affect the scenarios or their underlying assumptions, these scenarios are still valid. However, they will not be discussed further here.  In accordance with the 2004 revisions to 40 CFR Part 68 (69 FR 18819-18837, April 9, 2004), a discussion of the WCS?s and ARS?s is no longer required for inclusion in the ES.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\n1.0    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe North Wastewater Treatment plant of the city of Baton Rouge keeps on site the necessary documents related to the operation and maintenance of the plant in a safe manner.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals (not only chlorine and sulfur dioxide but sodium hydroxide solution - caustic - as well); operating limits for all key process parameters; record of the current inventory of these chemicals; and data on equipment design and specifications.\n\n\n\nThese documents include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n\n\n* Copies of current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS?s) for the chemicals involved\n\n* Vendor?s Operatio"

They show material inventories and a record of the shipments of chemicals delivered on site.\n\n\n\nThe above records are updated as applicable and necessary.\n\n\n\n2.0     Hazard Review\n\n\n\nA detailed review of the hazards associated with the operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems at the NWWTP was performed in the late Winter and early Spring of 1999.  The Process Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) review technique was used to identify any hazards and ensure that the necessary controls are in place to manage such hazards.\n\n\n\nA team of individuals representing the operations, maintenance, safety, engineering and management departments conducted the HAZOP review and issued a report that presented and discussed the ?Action Items? identified.  This report was submitted to management for resolution.  The corrective action(s) identified for each action item were documented and most were addressed and resolved, although a few outstanding items remain.\n\n\n\nFurther, since there have not been any significant changes to the chlorination and sulfur dioxide systems in the last 5 years, it was only necessary to perform a revalidation of the original HAZOP study, with the major focus being aimed at a detailed evaluation of the changes that were made to the Cl2 and SO2 systems within this time frame.\n\n\n\n3.0     Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe NWWTP keeps on site copies of all operating and maintenance procedures that were prepared and submitted to the city by the plant design firm.  These procedures address not only normal plant operations but other operating modes such as start-up, normal shut-down, emergency shut-downs, start-up fol"

As a part of this training, the employees were given written tests to verify their understanding of the process, the operating conditions, the hazards inherent in the materials being handled and the appropriate responses to alarm conditions and emergencies.  \n\n\n\nAny time that the process undergoes modifications, changes or improvements, all operators affected by such changes will be provided with the necessary training.  In addition, periodic refresher training sessions are held with the participation of all operating and maintenance personnel.\n\n\n\n5.0    Maintenance\n\n\n\nThe NWWTP has in place procedures for the periodic inspection and maintenance of the major components of the chlorination and dechlorination systems.  The operator performs daily rounds, during which he/she visually inspects all process equipment, instruments and piping and also verifies that the system is operating according to design.  The operator will enter his/her comments and observations on the daily log, when and as applicable.

These audits will determine how effectively the policies and procedures of the RMP have been implemented.  The audit findings are submitted to management for resolution and corrective action as necessary and applicable.  Documentation of the audits, findings and resolutions are maintained as part of the prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe last compliance audit was performed in May of 2003.  The audit team included members of the operation, maintenance and management staffs of the wastewater treatment department.\n\n\n\n7.0    Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe NWWTP has established procedures to promptly investigate all incidents which result, or could reasonably have resulted, in a significant release of one or more of the regulated chemicals.  The objectives of such investigations are:\n\n\n\n* to establish the facts relating to the incident, \n\n* to determine the factors causing or contributing, directly or indirectly, to the incident and\n\n* to define what corrective actions, if any, are necessary to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.\n\n\n\nThe incident investigation team includes members of the staff who are familiar with the process involved in the incident and also includes personnel from the operations, maintenance and management departments.\n\n\n\nThe investigating team submits its findings and recommendations to plant management for resolution.

The emergency response plan is periodically reviewed and verified for completeness and correctness.\n\n\n\nEmergency preparedness and response drills are held periodically with participation of personnel from all three of Baton Rouge?s wastewater treatment plants.  These drills also involve the participation of and are executed under the guidance of the Baton Rouge HazMat team and the Baton Rouge Fire Department.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThere were some action items identified during the original HAZOP analysis that were directly or indirectly related to safety.  As a result of one such item, the NWWTP has already switched both the chlorination and dechlorination (sulfur dioxide) systems from liquid to vapor feed.  This change has virtually eliminated all pressurized liquid chemical lines from these two systems, with the sole exception of the liquid chlorine unloading line, which is full of liquid chlorine only while a chlorine truckload is being unloaded into the storage tank..\n\n\n\nThe new vapor feed lines are temporary at present to allow these systems to continue to operate, but the preparatory activities are already under way for the replacement of these lines with permanent ones.  These final changes will be completed within the near future.\n\n\n\nVjs - H:\\My Documents\\BTNROUGE\\5-yr RMP\\NWWTP\\rmp04exec-sumNWWTP.doc    Page 1 of 6 \n\n\n\n"
