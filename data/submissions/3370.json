      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan - Executive Summary for Superior Deshler Inc., Davenport, NE\nSuperior Deshler, Inc. receives, stores and distributes Anhydrous Ammonia at the facility located in Davenport, Nebraska.  The maximum storage quanity of Anhydrous is 140,196 lbs..  The facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - A maximum of 140,196 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous state over a duration of 10 minutes at 14,020 lbs/min into the urban area surrounding the plant up to an endpoint of 1.10 miles.  the offsite consequences could include approximately 383 people, including residences and schools.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - A transfer hose failure on the Anhydrous Ammonia facility has the potential to release 26,638 lbs. of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 13,319 lbs/min in the urban area surrounding the plant up to .59 miles.  The offsite consequences could effect approximately 300 people in residences and schools.\n\nThe owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire departments and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the community and the enviornment.  The facility has had no such release in the past 5 years.  Complying with safety standards for the stroage and handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia and completing regular maintenance on the equipment at the facility will continue to prevent any accidental releases at the Superior Deshler, Inc. plant at Davenport, Nebraska."
