The facility is designed to recycle aluminum from shredded non-ferrous scrap metal using a wet heavy media separation process.  This is followed by secondary smelting of the reclaimed aluminum to produce approximately 100,000 tons per year of aluminum metal.\n\nThe Environmental, Safety, and Health Policy of Audubon is to purchase, manufacture, process, sell and dispose of all materials in such a manner as to protect the health and safety of its employees, customers, the public and the environment.  Audubon will implement active programs for prevention of accidents and improvements in health and the environment.  In furtherance of this policy, Audubon will assure that: products and facilities are in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations; adopt safety and environmental standards where necessary to minimize employee, customer and community exposure to risk where prevailing laws and regulations may be inadequate; provide employees, customers and neighbors information concerning raw materials and products through use of Material Safety Data Sheets and similar documentation; support community awareness programs designed to answer legitimate community concerns about potential hazards that may be present; and produce the best value, best quality products and service, but never at the expense of the safety and health of its employees, neighbors or the environment. \n\nThe Audubon recycling facility receives shredded non-ferrous scrap metal by rail and truck.  After quality control checks, the shipments are unloaded in a roofed shed with concrete floor and prepared for separation of aluminum metal.  The received aluminum scrap contains other metallic scrap such as zinc, copper, stainless steel and magnesium alloys as well as traces of glass, plastic, rubber and dirt from shredding of automobiles and other scrap by "

The aluminum is segregated from the other materials in stages, utilizing inherent specific gravity differences in a wet media environment.  The separated aluminum scrap is washed and dried in preparation for smelting while the other residual  metals are sold to other offsite metal recyclers.  Wastes consisting of glass, plastic, dirt and rubber are accumulated in rolloff boxes and shipped for disposal in a permitted solid waste landfill.\n\nThe aluminum scrap is smelted in three 120,000 pound natural gas-fired reverbatory hearth furnaces which combine the melting with converting, using a new proprietary refining process for removal of traces of magnesium and other impurities in the melt.  A modern metallurgy laboratory, utilizing a  X-ray diffraction spectrometer, analyzes the in-process materials and guides the refining process to meet customer specifications.   Various alloying materials such as ferrosilicon, copper, etc. are added and chlorine gas injected into the molten metal through a proprietary German technology using a submerged graphite recirculation pump that not only recirculates the molten metal within the multichambered furnace for heat transfer purposes but also causes intimate mixing of the gas with the metal without bubbling (as in conventional technology).  As a result of this intimate mixing, nearly stoichiometric utilization of chlorine occurs, with virtually no residual chlorine emissions. The impurities float to the molten metal surface as dross consisting of metallic chloride salts.  The dross is periodically removed by skimming the surface.  After cooling, it is shipped for offsite processing and disposal.  The molten, refined aluminum metal is cast into ingots or placed in ladles for direct shipment to an adjacent aluminum die casting customer. \n\nThe modern design of the new "

There is no discharge of waste water from the facility except for sanitary sewage wastewater from employee comfort facilities.  An innovative, high efficiency air pollution control system is also provided. The wet processing of scrap inherently eliminates dust emission potential from raw material handling and processing.  Further, all furnace gases are ducted to a dry scrubber system using slaked lime (calcium hydroxide)  injection for efficiently removing chlorine and other gaseous pollutants.  This is followed by a high effieciency fabric filter baghouse for collecting remaining particulate dust.  The aluminum dryer unit may utilize the waste heat from the smelting furnace offgases and therefore, it is equipped with an afterburner for control of smoke followed by a second dry scrubber/baghouse pollution contro system for cleaning the exhaust gases.\n\nThe chlorine used for the refining (demag) process is stored in one ton cylinders in a dedicated Chlorine Room at the northwest side of the plant building.  The liquid is vaporized and piped overhead  to the demag well of each furnace, with various monitoring and safety devices incorporated  to ensure automatic and manual shutoff of gas as well as appropriate alarms in the control room.  The control room is manned by the Furnace Production Supervisor and trained operators.  Approximately fifteen cylinders, containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine each, may be stored in the Chlorine Room at any time, with two cylinders attached to the pig tail piping manifold provided.  Each cylinder is open online to facilitate operation of two furnaces, one cylinder for each furnace.  The system will operate from one cylinder to allow for cylinder changes.

The applicable regulations are  promulgated in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68 requiring  preparation and implementation of a  Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The regulations have also been adopted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky by reference under Title 401 Chapter 68 of the Kentucky Administrative Regulations (KAR).  \n\n\nAs part of the prevention program necessitated by the storage of chlorine and the above hazard assessment results, Audubon has undertaken steps to minimize the potential for a release.  The chlorine piping in the facility is color coded yellow and labelled.  Only qualified contractors are allowed to make changes to the system if and when required, after review with the design engineers of the material specifications, needed precautions, leak checks and system integrity inspection procedures prior to startup.

This trained emergency response team can be at the Audubon facility in minutes in case of an accidental release due to close proximity to the Brenntag facility.  The Audubon facility has made arrangements with Brenntag for emergency assistance by the trained response team in case of need.  In addition, Audubon has prepared and implemented a plant emergency plan to ensure suitable reponse to a chlorine release emergency and will be coordinating response plans with local emergency responders in accordance with Kentucky Emergency Planning Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committee requirements.\n\nThe facility has never experienced a reportable release of chlorine during its history and has had no need to use the emergency procedures or the response team.  Actions taken under the RMP prevention program are likely to further minimize the potential for a contingency requiring a response."
