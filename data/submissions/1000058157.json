      "SummaryText": "Arctic Glacier operates an ice manufacturing facility in Lubbock, Texas. At this facility, we manufacture and store ice to be distributed to convenience stores, restaurants and other customers.\n\nLike most ice manufacturing facilties, we use anhydrous\nammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant \navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, \nammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nArctic Glacier is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation\nfor our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system \nobeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\nand standards where appropriate.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management \nprogram to help us operate and maintain the system safely.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\nmerely responding to problems.  Our Process Safety Management program includes\nelements addressing:\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\npoints in our program.\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\nrefrigeration system to identify the\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\nrefrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established establishing a\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\nof the refrigeration system.\n- Management of Change:"

      "SummaryText": "Alterations to the refrigeration system are\nscreened to verify that they are within the original safe design\nlimits.\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we\nconduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new\nequipment has been designed and installed properly.\n- Contractors: We carefully screen contractors who work on our\nproperty to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n- Hot Work Permits: We strictly control welding and other work that\ncould start a fire near the ammonia equipment.\n- Emergency Response: We coordinate our response to emergencies\nwith the local Fire Department and LEPC.\n- Incident Investigation: After an incident, we investigate to\ndetermine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n- Compliance Audits: Every three years, we examine the\nsafety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n- Trade Secrets: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets\nprogram in case confidential information affecting the safety of the\nammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n- Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing\nprogress of safety items.\n\nWe used the EPA's ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate hazard levels.\n(See the Risk Management Plan,\navailable from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the\noffsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S.\nGovernment has advised the regulated community not to disclose the\nactual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)\n\nThrough our Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs, Arctic Glacier always looks\nfor possible system changes to improve safety in our facility."
