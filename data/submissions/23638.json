As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of such chemicals.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of covered processes as well as proper operator training for those who maintain the system(s).\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle hazardous chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law.\n\nOur emergency action plan is incorporated in the Hazardous Materials Management Plan for this plant.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders and a specific protocol for evacuation due to a release.  The Plan assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law.\n\nIt is the policy of this facility to devote the time, energy, and capital toward maintaining prevention and response programs appropriate to the inherent dangers with the use of hazardous chemicals.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe SMS Briners, Inc. facility is located in the agriculturally productive San Joaquin Valley just east of Stockton, California.  The company provides various brined vegetables and fruits for the retail and wholesale markets. The fac"

The plant is located along State Highway 4 in a rural agricultural area is located approximately eight miles east of State Highway 99.\n\nSMS Briners, Inc. uses one covered process hazardous chemical in its operations. Sulfur dioxide is stored in up to five (5) 2000-lb. cylinders as a pressurized liquid.  The chemical is injected into brine as a preserving agent for cherries.  The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide stored or used at this plant in all processes is 10,000 pounds, which is limited by written ordering procedures.  The maximum inventory occurs seasonally (May - July) and lesser amounts are inventoried the remainder of the year.\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios were modeled using ALOHA, a computer simulation program approved by the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services and the EPA as appropriate for these scenarios.  Simulations for releases provided estimates of the distance to the toxic endpoint for each case.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenarios are not the most likely scenarios but serve to demonstrate the potential effects of catastrophic events.  Due to system controls such as proper operating procedures and equipment with inherent safety features, these scenarios have a low likelihood of occurring.\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes a complete release of liquefied chemical under pressure from the largest process vessel for a duration of ten minutes.  The model assumes a low wind speed of 1.5 m/s and a very stable atmosphere.  The distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be approximately 3.3 miles and involves the release of sulfur dioxide. The population within the area potentially affected is estimated to be 250 inhabitants.  Public receptors potentially impacted by this"

The methodologies used in the worst-case scenarios (ALOHA) were also used for the alternative case release scenarios.  The alternative case release scenarios are those scenarios more likely to occur and that will reach an endpoint offsite, if one exists.\n\nThe first alternative scenario consists of a release from the 2000-pound cylinder due to a fire or excessive heat.  Both releases were evaluated due to the likelihood estimates from the Process Hazard Analysis.  The distance to toxic endpoint offsite is approximately 2.3 mile and the number of people potentially affected is approximately 100.  Due to the prevailing winds from the west, the impacts are likely to occur in the easterly direction from the facility.  Though wind direction can vary throughout the year, it is estimated that the public receptors potentially affected include residences associated with nearby farming operations.\n\nThough the distances to toxic endpoints are not necessarily realistic estimates of the areas in which the public might be endangered in the event of a release due to inherent uncertainty in the model assumptions, the scenario results indicate that prevention measures are essential and that emergency response may require evacuation some distance from the plant, including the plant. \n\nControl measures at the plant that decrease the chance of the above event from occurring include trained and qualified system operators, a preventive maintenance program, cylinder restraints, and the lack of combustible elements in the process area.  This release scenario has a relatively low likelihood of occurrence.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario models a ruptured pipe, hose, fitting, or valve in the sulfur dioxide sys"

In the event of this release type, the emergency action plan would be initiated and emergency responders would likely arrive in time to further mitigate the offsite consequences.  It is estimated that approximately 10 people could be affected offsite by this type of release.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with the Risk Management Program requirements for a RMP Program 3 Prevention Plan.  This requirement has been met by the PSM for the process.  Key prevention steps taken by this facility to maintain safety include operator training, the use of qualified system operators, written operating procedures, and a preventive maintenance program for system components.\n\nThe facility utilizes a recognized sulfur dioxide supplier who uses industry-standard compressed gas cylinders.  The systems are located in areas largely protected from heat or physical damage.  The in-service cylinder is secured on a cradle and the standby cylinders are blocked to prevent valve damage from tipping or rolling.  The facility is not fenced and but traffic egress is monitored at the road entry to the facility.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of sulfur dioxide at this facility in the last five years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe program for emergency response to the release of hazardous chemicals is an integral element of the Hazardous Materials Management Plan for this facility. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis facility has recently completed review of its operating and maintenance procedures to ensure adequate safety measures are in place.  There will be minor changes in piping and valve placement to reduce the possibility of releases from supply line failure."
