Facility Policy\n          The owners, management and employees of Big Wapsie Ag Services are committed to the \n           prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should\n           occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Fayette County LEPC,\n           and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and\n           the environment.\n\n     2.   Facility Information\n\n           The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n           Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application and as a\n            nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stoered would be 150,000 pounds\n            in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n     3.   Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n           a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released\n           as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 54,000 pounds,\n           which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by\n           design standards and administrative controls. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion        \n            to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .74 mile.\n\n           b.  The altermate release scenario: a 1 - inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release\n            scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow\n            shut-down value / values intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow\n            of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds.  The distance to the\n            endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 mile."

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n           The facility is in  compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the  Storage                 \n           and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards\n           Institude, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health \n           Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n           The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part\n           21- Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous\n           ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see\n           Section 8.3 (b).\n\n     5.   Five-Year Accident History.\n\n           There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years\n           that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our\n           knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in of-site deaths, injuries,\n           evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n           \n\n     6.   Emergency Action  Program.\n\n           The facility has:\n\n           a.  a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n           b.  provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community \n                right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n        \n     7.   Planned Changes to improve Safety.\n\n           Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed\n           to assess the conditions of the facility.\n\n           There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of\n           anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
