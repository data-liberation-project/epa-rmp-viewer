The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Lexington Terminal is coordinated with the Lexington County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Lexington Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Lexington Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Lexington Terminal.\r\n\r\n* No changes are planned at the Lexington Terminal."

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Lexington Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\r\n\r\n* Plant video surveillance system\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n\r\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\r\n\r\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\r\n\r\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\r\n\r\n* Seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\r\n\r\n* Terminal fire detection system\r\n\r\n* Terminal emergency shutdown (ESD) system with multiple activation points\r\n\r\n* Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Terminal firewater system\r\n\r\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\r\n\r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, \r\n\r\nEmergency Procedures Information\r\n\r\nThe Lexington Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

The stored quantity is below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Lexington Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Lexington Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to"
