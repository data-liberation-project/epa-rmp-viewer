This commitment is strongly supported by senior management of Prism Gas and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. This plant implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release. However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility, in cooperation with local emergency response agencies, are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Woodlawn Gas Plant is a facility that receives raw natural gas from well production.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines. Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site. The extracted natural gas liquids include propane and y-grade (flammable mixture) that are delivered to market via transport vehicles and pipeline. There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility that represents all flammables is failure of a y-grade storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere, resulting in an offsite impact. EPA's RMP Comp. Version 1.07 was used to calculate this release scenario. This type of scenario is very unlikely to occur. In addition, qualified individuals operate this facility daily; the equipment is inspected a"

EPA's RMP Comp. Version 1.07 was used to calculate this release scenario. Qualified individuals operate this facility daily and the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule, further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.\r\nThere are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals. Facility accident prevention programs promote the proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment. \r\n\r\nThe implementation of The Employee Participation Program requires the development of the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce. An established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility. All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines. In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures. Safe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements. Safe work practices include site"

Prism Gas has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program, and in ensuring the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Woodlawn Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment. The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance. The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination. All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures. Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort. The emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility. This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program. Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date programs that are on the market today. All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."
