Koch Foods Chattanooga recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\n\nTo accomplish Koch Foods of Chattanooga's Processing Facility  goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes government mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of Koch Foods of Chattanooga Safety Program are to achievemaximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with Koch Foods of Chattanooga's Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program. These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68). Koch Foods Chattanooga Plant Manager and Maintenance Manager are responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases. The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic accidents. As a whole these programs are designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuri"

Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates a [NAICS#49312 (Refrigerated Warehousing and Storage Facility)] freezer warehouse at P. O. Box 749 Chattanooga, TN 37401. An ammonia refrigeration system is in operation to maintain the storage, shipping, and holding temperatures in frozen perishable products.\n\nThe facility operates an (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, which provides cooling throughout the facility. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7) contained in this refrigeration system is in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds to initiate OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan. Koch Foods of Chattanooga's maximum inventory in the refrigeration system is 17,750  pounds. Due to the volume of ammonia and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, which could pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\n\nC. Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n1. Worst-Case\nThe worst-case release scenario at that facility involves the release 6400 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to over-filling high pressure receiver during a pump-down. The maximum level of vessel HPR  is limited to 80% of the vessel. \n\nThe worst-case scenario is unlikely for the following reasoons:\n-Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design and construction of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n-Ammonia is not corrosive in this process.\n-Pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressures in this receiver.\n-The facility utilizes a preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the vessel.\n-The facility has a training program that insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\n-The facility requires that all PSM elements as wel"

Alternative Release Scenarios\nA. First Alternate Release Scenario\nThe release of 300 pounds per minute of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period due to a puncture of a  pipe feeding an evaporator valve station on the roof with pumped liquid. This scenario could occur during a maintenance procedure or unsecured equipment striking this line. The modeled OCA (Off-site Consequece Analysis) for this scenario has a radius of less than 0.75  mile. The population impacted by this scenario is  6,500 residents and surrounding businesses.\n\nThe alternate release scenarios are unlikely for the following reasons:\n-Koch Foods of Chattanooga has policies to enforce only that competent personnel work on the system and has the power to remove any offending employee and/or contractor from the companies payroll and or contracts.\n-The system was designed using standard using standard practices and is maintained by rigid company standards.\n-The maintenance program includes a mechanical integrity audit system.\n-The maintenance program includes a shift monitoring procedure of the refrigeration system by fully trained personnel.\n-Low level controls controls, sensors for ammonia monitoring, and maintaining a safe ammonia liquid supply to the  vessels  act  as active mitigation before the release poses a threat to offsite receptors.\n-The piping is routed to avoid impact from traffic sources. A majority of the pipes are located on the roof.\n-Forklift operators have been trained and certified by the company, and trained in the locations and operations of the ammonia refrigeration evaporators that are located within their working areas.\n-Industry standards were followed for the manufacturing of the ammonia vessels, and the vessels were supplied by a reputable company meeting the guidelines spelled out in th"
