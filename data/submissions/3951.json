We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training, and inspecting processes available.  \n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).   The Rich Products Murfreesboro facility will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  Trained on-site responders will access the emergency, and decide on a coarse of action.  For emergencies within their training level they will respond.  For any emergency not included in their training, off-site emergency response agencies will be called.     \n\nThe Stationary Source.  The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system at this frozen dough facility.  Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) is the regulated substance handled at this facility.   The refrigeration system has a maximum ammonia inventory of 35,000 pounds.  This quantity qualifies the refrigeration system as a Program 3 process.\n\nThe Worst-case Scenario.  The worst-case scenario for the Murfreesboro facility is the rupture of the largest ammonia storage holding tank.  The volume of the storage tank would allow a maximum of 21,875 pounds of liquid ammonia to be stored.  Administrative controls limit the tank volume to 80% of the maximum, or 17,500 pounds of liquid ammonia.  In the worst case scenario this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents onto the ground in ten minutes.  Using the EPA look-up tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.6 miles.    \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is the discharge of all the ammonia from the largest compressor in the equipment room.  This compressor has a capacity of 1950 pounds of ammonia.  In the alternative scenario this compressor loses its entire charge during a ten-minute release due to a failed valve."

      "SummaryText": "The ammonia is vented to the roof by the automatic ventilation equipment installed in the equipment room. Using the EPA look-up tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program.  We currently in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule.  The accidental release prevention program includes a combination of design, training, and inspecting.  The refrigeration system was designed according to current codes and specifications, and adheres to good operating practice.  The operators and contractors who work in and around the refrigeration equipment have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures.  We have a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration equipment.  These programs are described in more detail in the full RMP program\n\nFive Year Accident History.   We have had one accidental release in the last five years.   The accident was caused by a valve failure resulting in injuries to eight employees.  The eight injured employees were treated by emergency responders and taken to the local hospital.  All were released that same day with no serious health effects.  There were no offsite injuries.      \n\nEmergency Response Program.  The Rich Products Murfreesboro facility has a written ERP that includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system.  On-site responders will respond to small accidental releases.  Any large or uncontrolled release will require assistance from off-site responding agencies.  The ERP plan states the specific procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release.  The ERP also includes information on emergency health care for exposure to anhydrous ammonia.  The ERP was last reviewed on March 31, 1999.  ERP training for all employees was last conducted on March 31, 1999.  The ERP is coordinate"
