As part of this commitment, El Paso has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at El Paso and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA'S) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accident Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\n\nOne of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at El Paso.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at El Paso.\n\nThe RMP program at El Paso consists of three (3) elements:\n     1) A hazard assessment to help understand:\n\n             -The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and;\n             -accidents that have occurred during the last five (5) years associated  with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n     2) A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes \tcontaining more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n     3) An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of \tregulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the RMP program at El Paso helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at El Paso.  In fact, El Paso has a comprehensive safety program to safeguard against the release of hazardous substances and limit injuries and damage to it"

Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at El Paso, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect El Paso workers, the public, and the environment, and El Paso takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nEl Paso prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at El Paso, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nEl Paso limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  El Paso trains workers to respond to an emergency response, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, El Paso workers with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to limit injuries and environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at El Paso consists of a number of elements, many of which are required by the RMP rule.  These are the same elements defined under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule, which are required for this facility.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at El Paso that are required by the RMP rule."
