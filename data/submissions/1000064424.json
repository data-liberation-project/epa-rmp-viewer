During procurement of contractor services, Company purchasing procedures require the verification of training, safety record, and if applicable, certifications and licenses. Prior to initiating work at the facility, contractors are required to attend a safety orientation, which is documented and records retained. Some contractors are required to work on or near process equipment; therefore, the facility has established procedures to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that are found during their work. At least one Arkema employee is assigned to each contractor. The Arkema employee is responsible for checking the work of each contractor to ensure Arkema procedures are followed. Safe Work Permitting practices are followed to ensure hazards and scope of work are reviewed with contractors working in the facility.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nArkema encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management, behavior based safety and accident prevention.  Arkema engages its employees through formal and informal means. The management of change process is an intranet-based workflow process that notifies affected employees of the change or changes. The technical support team reviews and approves changes before implementation.  A shift change meeting is conducted to discuss issues and concerns covering all aspects of the employee's work. Employees have access either through Arkema network to access information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Employees are encouraged to participate in the ac"

In addition, employees are involved in other aspects of the operation including, but not limited to, periodic inspections, operating procedure creation, and incident investigations. Employees also participate in pre start-up safety reviews after periods of shutdown or before changes are implemented that affect the process.\n\n\n\nEquipment Design \n\nVessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation \n\nArkema promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident by reviewing facts and developing corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The production leader is responsible for incident investigations at the facility.  No incidents occurred in the past 5 years involving RMP covered chemicals that required incident investigation.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\nArkema has a robust system to ensure that modifications to facilities and processes are reviewed by the appropriate technical staff, management, and affected employees. This is an electronic workflow process located on Arkema Intranet site. The management of change requests are controlled and tracked to completion. This process requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before implementation. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nArkema has well-established practices and procedures to maintain tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, transfer hoses, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

A preventative maintenance system (SAP) is used to track work orders, calibration schedules, testing and certification schedules, and completion of all the above. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the facility's process equipment. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures \n\nArkema maintains written procedures that provide detail on how to safely operate a process, including various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained up-to-date by revising them as necessary. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nArkema conducts reviews just prior to startup to ensure that new and modified facilities and processes are safe for operation.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nArkema conducted a PHA in 2014 using the HAZOP/Layer of Protection Analysis.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a means for establishing inspection and maintenance activities. \n\n\n\nSafe Work/Hot Work Practices \n\nArkema has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a hot work permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\n\n\nTraining/Certification Programs \n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Arkema has implemented a comprehensive training and certification program for all employees involved in operating a process.  After employees demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration), they are certified to work independently.  In addition, trained technical staff is available 24 hours a day to support operations. \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving a release of Vinyl Acetate or aqueous ammonia from affected systems at the facility that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nThe fa"

      "SummaryText": "cility maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including: \n\n* Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, \n\n* Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\n\n* Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, \n\n* Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements (if a release occurs), and \n\n* Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment. \n\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for Arkema in Torrance is coordinated with the Torrance Fire Department.  Arkema conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the appropriate emergency response organizations. \n\nIn addition, the Arkema Response to Accidents in Transit (REACTS) team responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S. \n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Torrance Fire Department. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nArkema completes a thorough review of the affected VAM / Ammonia system(s) each time a design change is implemented and reviews the standard operating procedures every three years.  Arkema audit team revalidates the PHA every five years from the date of the initial PHA.  Arkema is committed to using these methods to identify and "
