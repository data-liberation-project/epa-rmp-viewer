The Alternative Release Scenario chosen involves one 120-gallon 4 BW cylinder of MMH being transported from the 500 Area Interim Storage Area to the 400 Test Area. While loading or unloading the 120-gallon 4 BW cylinder of MMH onto the transport trailer, there is an accident that causes the cylinder to be physically dropped off the transport vehicle, resulting in a rupture of the drum and a release from the 120-gallon cylinder. An instantaneous release was predicted as the cylinder is under 50 psig (during transport). The response by the on-site Fire Department was estimated to be 15 minutes, which includes curtailment of the release from the cylinder.\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is a liquid release of 100 % MMH, which is identified as a toxic liquid. The postulated release resulted in 120 gallons (880 lbs) of MMH being released at ground level onto an unconfined soil area (not diked). Upon release of the MMH onto the unconfined soil area, there was subsequent vaporization of MMH into the air. Meteorological conditions used for the Alternative Release scenario were those selected as representative based on data from the WSTF Facility Master Plan. The shipping container mishandling scenario was modeled as a liquid stream released continuously at 108 \u00b0F at ground level with 30% humidity with a wind speed of 15 mph.

In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.190(b)(5-6) and (c), WSTF is required to submit an updated RMP within 6 months of a change that requires a revised Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), within 6 months of a change that requires a revised offsite consequence analysis, and/or within 6 months for the de-registration of a stationary source no longer being covered. Since the last RMP submission (2014), WSTF has made changes to covered processes in order to improve the safety of personnel by moving large quantities of propellant out of the test areas and into a dedicated storage area. These changes have resulted in the elimination of a covered process in the 300 Area (2014 NASA WSTF RMP Process ID # 1000051777), changing the propellant storage capacity in the 400 Area (2014 NASA WSTF RMP Process ID # 1000051778), and transferring the propellant to the 500 Area Fuel Storage and Distribution Area (2014 NASA WSTF RMP Process ID # 1000051779).

This policy is based upon the concept that emergency functions for various organizations involved in emergency management will generally parallel normal day-to-day functions. Activities that do not contribute directly to resolving the emergency may be postponed or redirected for the duration of any emergency, making labor, materials, and equipment available for emergency use. \r\n\r\nWSTF utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) in the handling of emergencies. Fire, medical, and chemical spills that exceed WSTF local area capabilities to handle safely are examples of emergencies that will be handled using the ICS. Emergencies of all types will be dealt with at the lowest level that is practical and safe. When an incident is elevated to an emergency classification, there is a clear transition of authority to an Incident Commander once they arrive on the scene, and the local person in charge functions as a unified commander or technical advisor. WSTF follows an all-hazard approach and acknowledges that most responsibilities and functions performed during an emergency are not hazard specific.
