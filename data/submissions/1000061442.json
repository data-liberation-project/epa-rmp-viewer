Thrifty Ice Cream has developed a risk management program to address the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). Thrifty Ice Cream is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  Thrifty Ice Cream staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nThrifty Ice Cream has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Process. Thrifty Ice Cream policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Thrifty Ice Cream is also coordinated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Health Hazardous Materials Division serving the City of El Monte area, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThrifty Ice Cream's primary activities encompass production of ice cream and frozen desert products.  Ammonia (anhydrous), used as a refrigerant, is the only regulated substance present at Thrifty Ice Cream.  The maximum inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) is 40,700 pounds and is contained within a single, 2 stage, refrigeration system serving the various production and process areas within the Thrifty Ice Cream, El Monte ice cream plant.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined for the cover"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook. \n\n \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\n\nTwo alternative case release scenarios were modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook. \n\n\n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAlthough the use of anhydrous ammonia for the refrigeration process has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community, Thrifty Ice Cream has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make the worst case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a release of a regulated substance:\n\n - The system has alarms and interlocks\n\n - The system undergoes periodic maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n - Gas detection is in place to notify individuals if a leak occurs.\n\n - The equipment modeled for the release is located in a room within the building; an appropriate, yet conservative mitigation factor was accounted for in the analysis.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Thrifty Ice Cream to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia."
