Specific changes to the propane process at the Bakersfield Terminal will be implemented as needed.\n----------\n\nES \u2013 7.0 THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were evaluated for each of the regulated processes. The detailed results of the evaluation are provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Administrative controls limit the tank fill capacity to in accordance with NFPA 58 7.4.3.2(B).\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO. The worst-case release scenario is the release of propane from a storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount (85% capacity). The scenario assumes a complete release of 145,180 pounds of propane. The pressure wave (with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure) would extend 0.4 miles (0.9 kilometers). The pressure wave could reach the residential neighborhood located to the west of the site as well as the industrial areas to the east and to the south. There are no sensitive receptors within this blast zone.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO. The alternative release scenario based on the process hazards analysis (or a more plausible potential incident) is a catastrophic release from a full-sized (10,600 gallon water capacity) transport truck. This scenario assumes that the tanker leaks from the bottom-mounted entry valve and that the entire contents of the truck are released to the atmosphere. The alternative release scenario would produce a pressure wave with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure that would extend 0.2 miles (0.3 kilometers). The resulting pressure wave has the potential to impact nearby businesses within this blast radius. There are no residences or sensitive receptors within this blast zone."

The procedures describe the manner of response to a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Bakersfield Terminal is coordinated with the Kern County Fire Department. This coordination involves periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Bakersfield Terminal has around the clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.

The purpose of the pre-start-up safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for start-up prior to placing the equipment in service. \n-----\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS. Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Plant operations and management personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. \n-----\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION. The Bakersfield Terminal has procedures in place that require prompt investigation of incidents that resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a recurrence and presents these results to the business management team for resolution. \n-----\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION.

      "SummaryText": "United Pacific Energy | Bakersfield Terminal\nEPA Identification Number 1000-0014-3472\n----------\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nES \u2013 1.0 FACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE POLICY\nThe owners, management, and employees of Kiva Energy \u2013 LP Terminal, LLC Bakersfield Terminal located at 4937 Standard Street in Bakersfield, California, are committed to the prevention of an accidental release of odorized, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, propane). If an accidental release should occur, the facility staff are prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Emergency Response Program (ERP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n----------\n\nES \u2013 2.0 FACILITY INFORMATION\n- The Facility is a bulk, hydrocarbon storage and handling facility that receives LPG by rail cars and trucks. The liquefied petroleum gas is stored in the facility\u2019s 35 aboveground, pressurized storage tanks prior to being loaded into DOT approved delivery trucks (including those owned by Kiva Energy as well as third-party distributors). The 35 tanks are interconnected into 7 groups of 5 vessels. \n\n- A propane compressor is used to create a pressure differential between the rail cars or trucks being unloaded and the receiving vessels. The differential pressure \u201cpushes\u201d the LPG from the tank cars or trucks into the storage vessels. \n\n- The propane stored in the aboveground propane storage vessels (identified below) is transferred to DOT approved LPG transportation trucks of approximately 10,600 gallons or smaller bobtail propane delivery trucks of approximately 2,500 gallons through the use of a liquid propane pump. The storage vessels are protected by an automatic fire protection system (a deluge system) that would activate and automatically initiate a response from the local fire department in the event of a fire within the storage yard.\n\n--------------------\nTAN"
