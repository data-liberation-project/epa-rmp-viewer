The regulated substance handled is chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the US EPA.   Gaseous chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders located in the facility chlorine storage room.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is 18,000 pounds (9 tons).\n\nAccidental Release & Emergency Prevention Program:  \nThe Water Treatment Plant takes a systematic proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chlorine.  The plant is strictly covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  the prevention of accidental releases depends on adherence to the procedures used to handle chlorine, the safety equipment systems designed and constructed in the facility, and the training of personnel.  The RMP/PSM manual, Hazard Communication Program, and other written safety programs are kept in the main control room for employee access and review.\n\nEngineering controls have been added as part of the prevention program to limit the impact of an accidental release of chlorine.  The Water Treatment Plant has installed a chlorine scrubber which is designed to capture and treat the contents of an entire one-ton cylinder.  The system is also under a vacuum regulator that would cut off flow if a leak in the chlorine piping should occur.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nAlthough an accidental chlorine release is unlikely, the Water Treatment Plant has prepared for such a release as well as other emergencies.  The plant has developed an emergency action plan that complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The written plan"

      "SummaryText": " incorporates the Forest Grove Fire Department Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan.  In the event of an emergency, key personnel will perform critical tasks to ensure proper containment and/or plant shut down, then evacuate the premises or shelter in place, as deemed appropriate by the acting Incident Commander.\n\nA chemical emergency would involve the Regional Hazardous Materials Response Team, which will be summoned by Forest Grove Fire Department as necessary.  Incident Command will remain with the Fire Department.  Training exercises are planned with the cooperation of the Forest Grove Fire Department's Training Officer.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThere have been no major unresolved process hazards identified in the chlorine system at the Water Treatment Plant."
