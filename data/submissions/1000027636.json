      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nConstellation Wines has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Black Grape Chillers, 550 Refrigeration, Neutralization and Sulfur Dioxide Systems.  Constellation Wines? policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\n550 REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Refrigeration system is a Risk Management Program 3 (RMP). This process is a centralized ammonia compression refrigeration system consisting of four (4) 700 hp screw compressors, high pressure receiver, and one (1) low pressure liquid ammonia recirculation system. There are fourteen (14) shell & tube heat exchangers used for direct cooling of wine. \n\n\n\nSULFUR DIOXIDE SYSTEM\n\nThe Sulfur Dioxide system is a RMP program 3. There are two phases to this process.  The first phase is the simple transfer of liquid anhydrous sulfur dioxide from a one-ton cylinder into smaller gauging cylinders. This process uses gravity assisted by inert gas counterpressure to provide the motive force. The second phase involves the injecting of sulfur dioxide into the wine to inhibit, and stop the fermentation process.  The injection is done from both the gauging cylinder and one-ton cylinders.\n\n\n\nBLACK GRAPE CHILLERS\n\nThe Refrigeration system is a Risk Management Program 3 (RMP). This process is a centralized ammonia compression refrigeration system consisting of a screw compressors, high pressure receiver, and a low pressure liquid ammonia recirculation system. There are eight (8) shell & tube heat exchangers used for direct cooling of wine. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one worst-case relea"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\n  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for each of the four systems.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, Constellation Wines has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a anhydrous ammonia or sulfur dioxide release.  The facility also has safety systems in place to protect personnel such as PSVs, safety showers, respiratory equipment, and gas detection.\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of RMP, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Constellation Wines to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide. Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n\n\n?68.65    Process Safety Information (PSI) \n\n?68.67    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n?68.69 Operating Procedures (OP)\n\n?68.71    Training (TRN)\n\n?68.73    Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n?68.75    Management of Change (MOC)\n\n?68.77    Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\n?68.79    Compliance "
