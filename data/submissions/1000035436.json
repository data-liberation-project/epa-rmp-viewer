The facility is located in Greensboro, NC and stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.  In addition to petroleum storage, Magellan stores butane onsite for blending into gasoline which requires compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations as greater than 10,000 lbs are stored onsite.  \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance at this facility is butane.  The equipment which handles butane includes five pressure vessels and associated piping.  The pressure vessel and associated piping may contain up to 1,463,634 lbs of butane.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Greensboro II Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the company's policy to notify the Guilford County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no Trade Secrets.  The facility complies with the Feder"

Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere has been no accidental release from the butane process at the Greensboro II terminal that has required reporting under the RMP rule within the past five years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  Within the past five years the butane storage and blending process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the new butane process arise at the Greensboro II Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Terminal Holdings, L.P."
