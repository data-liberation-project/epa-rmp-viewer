The facility is operated and maintained in accordance with OSHA 1910.119, PSM requirements.  A written emergency plan is in place which includes coordination and response by the Fremont County Emergency Management, if required.\n\nThe Lost Cabin Gas Plant removes carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur compounds, and water from natural gas in order to meet pipeline specifications for product sales.  A Union Carbide solvent (SELEXOL) is used to remove the gas contaminates in each of the two gas processing trains.  A propane refrigeration system is utilized in each train to cool the solvent to improve its performance.  Each of the two propane refrigeration systems are equipped with compressors, piping valves and a receiver tank that contains approximately 50,000 pounds of propane.\n\nThe two propane receiver tanks are separated by approximately 400 feet of distance.  Failure of either tank will trigger a worst case scenario.  Each tank normally contains 50,000 pounds of propane.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles.  There are no private homes or public receptors within the distance to the endpoint from either propane receiver tank.  This facility complies with ASME code requirements and OSHA PSM, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe plant personnel are equipped to control incipient fires and other emergencies.  Offensive efforts to fight fires beyond the incipient stage will be the responsibility of off-site fire departments.  They are authorized to take whatever actions are deemed necessary to protect lives and property.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, the first line of defense will be to handle incipient t"

If the personnel on duty can not adequately stabilize and control the incident or if a fire has grown beyond the incipient stage, then emergency call out procedures will be initiated per the facility Emergency Response Plan.  The emergency call out procedure contains phone numbers of local emergency response agencies, such as Fremont County Emergency Management - who has been advised and educated on potential events that would require their assistance.\n\nNo revisions are currently scheduled for our safety policies; however, continuous improvement programs are utilized consistent with the plant Incident Investigation Procedure and Wyoming OHS standards contained in 29 CFR Section 1910.120."
