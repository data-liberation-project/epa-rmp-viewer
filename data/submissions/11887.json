Accidential Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Dan River Inc. - Schoolfied Complex are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is best demonstrated by the fact that we have not experienced a release of chlorine in the past 20 years.  We have accomplished this by having a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nOur facility's  primary activities encompass textile yarn manufacturing, dyeing, finishing, screen printing and sewing of home fashions.  We have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is chlorine which is used for water treatment.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 24,000 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Facilities  Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios. \n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from both the Filter Plant and the Pump House where chlorine cylinders are connected to chlorinators for water treatment.  In this scenario 4000 pounds of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.9 miles from each location is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release while connecting a cylinder to the chlorinator.  The scenario involves the release of 2 pounds of chlorine per minute.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.   Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures and chlorine detector alarms are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 55% reduction and shorter response time.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.  General Accidential Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Schoolfield Complex.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical  hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the chlorine process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out this analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidate"

The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/28/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Dan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations,  emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating  a chlorine process are competent in the operating procedures associated with that process.  Refresher training is provided at least every two (2) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels,  piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 09/03/1998.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made "

The most recent review was performed on 08/13/1997.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under  both the PSM and  RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 05/28/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex truly believes that process safety manangement and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees familiar with the process participate in the committee that develops and implements this program.    In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
