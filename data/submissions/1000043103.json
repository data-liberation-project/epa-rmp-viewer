The registration for this process is presented in the GRM-PG - Appendix A. \n\n\n\nThe PHBS is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorination process at the PHBS utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity. The PHBS is located at 2275 South Joe Battle Boulevard in the eastern portion of the City of El Paso, Texas. The PHBS is surrounded by residential and vacant land.\n\n\n\nCurrently PHBS has the potential to store two (2) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage room, the total amount of chlorine at this facility is 4,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n\n\n?    Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 99,540 people. The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people. \n\n\n\n?    Develop strategies to prevent an accidental release (Prevention Program), \n\n\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n\n\n\n?    Formulate contingency planning in the case of an accidental release (Emergency Response Program).\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-PSB's \"Emergency Response Action Pl"
