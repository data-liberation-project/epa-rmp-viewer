To meet this commitment, Cope Station has established systems to ensure safe operation of plant processes, which includes the safe and proper handling of hazardous substances at the plant.  One component of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP), which manages the risks involved with using hazardous substances.  Cope Station has designed this program to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public. \r\n \r\nCope Station's RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR  68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs.  This regulation is also referred to as \"the RMP rule\".  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at Cope Station.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide a description of the RMP.  \r\n\r\nThe Cope Station Power Plant is located at 405 Teamwork Road, Cope, South Carolina in the County of Orangeburg.  The power plant generates 430 megawatts of electricity from pulverized coal.\r\nThe Cope Station Power Plant operates a Selective Catalytic Reactor (SCR) to lower its total Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions.  The SCR process utilizes anhydrous ammonia to react with the NOx compounds, converting the NOx into nitrogen (an inert gas) and water vapor.  This process necessitates the storage of large"

The Cope Station Power Plant is rated a Program 3 facility.\r\n\r\nAlthough the RMPlan helps ensure that Cope Station's RMP covered system is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the plant's overall safety program.  In fact, a comprehensive safety program exists that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidents.\r\n\r\nCONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nLimiting the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule:\r\n\r\nDESC did perform a thorough evaluation before selecting a pollution control technology that uses\r\na hazardous substance regulated by the RMP rule (\"regulated substance\").  The potential for the\r\nhazardous substance to affect individuals and the environment has been considered, and DESC has\r\ntaken the appropriate steps to address the hazards.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventing releases of the regulated substances used:\r\n\r\nWhen a regulated substance is used, the equipment that contains it is carefully designed, built, and\r\noperated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  All applicable federal, state, corporate,\r\nand industry standards are strictly adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs:\r\n\r\nCope Station's main objective is to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from occurring.  In the analysis administrative controls (written procedures), high level alarms will limit the maximum volume of stored anhydrous ammonia to 85% tank capacity. The worst-case release scenario was identified to be a rupture of one of the storage tanks.  The result of this scenario was modeled using RMPCOMP.    \r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event of a release, employees are trained to recognize accidental releases quickly, assess the severity of a release and respond to mitigate and stop the release.

The anhydrous ammonia at Cope Station is stored in two tanks. The two storage tanks are located inside a concrete secondary containment dike to limit the spread of liquid ammonia in case of a tank rupture.  All appropriate steps have been taken to prevent the accidental release of\r\nanhydrous ammonia.  These steps include (a) training programs for personnel, (b) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process, and (c) programs\r\nto evaluate the hazards of our processes.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, DESC will be prepared to respond in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will minimize any injury to the public and the environment.

For Cope Station, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are also satisfied by this PSM program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\r\n\r\n3.1   Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program for anhydrous ammonia consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\n3.1.1   Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nA number of technical documents are maintained and are readily available at the plant, including an emergency preparedness plan to help ensure that plant and local emergency responders are aware of the hazards.  These documents address (a) physical properties of anhydrous ammonia, (b) operating parameters for the equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for the equipment.  This process safety information is available to our employees and contractors, as well.\r\n\r\n3.1.2   Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis of the anhydrous ammonia process was performed and will be periodically updated to identify process hazards, as well as to establish recommendations that will improve the safe operation of the RMP covered process.  This analysis is revised at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\r\n\r\n3.1.3   Operating Procedures \r\n\r\nCope Station's engineers, operators, and the Plant Manager worked together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to the ammonia system operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.

A program is in place to perform compliance audits of our RMP-covered processes every 3 years to be certain the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the process.  These audits are performed by an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two regulations and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the ammonia system.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n3.1.9   Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nA program is in place to investigate any incidents or near misses that could reasonably result in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.
