This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n    To save lives.\n\n    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n    To protect the environment.\n\n    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmericold maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Ameriold, Sioux City 6 facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximate"

In most cases at this facility the ammonia refrigeration is used to cool a secondary medium (brine)that is used to remove the heat in the refrigerated areas.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) is used as the primary refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe total ammonia inventory exceeds the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention    \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\nIIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n\nIIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nIIAR Bulletin R1, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nIn addition, the AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Sioux City 6 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation since 8-20-96.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP reportable releases in the five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAmeriold, Sioux City 6 has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility responders are trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\n\n\nDuring the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility continue to conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.  In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the Review of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study  generated mitigation measures that woul"
