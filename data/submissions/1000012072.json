If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Webberville facility are:\n>  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won\u00c2\u00bft reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n>  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tank.\n>  Pressure-relief valves (four) are located on the top of the bulk storage tank, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n>  An emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves (\u00c2\u00bfsnappy joes\u00c2\u00bf) on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.

      "SummaryText": "Webberville RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Webberville Wholesale Fertilizer is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular) and miscellaneous farm supplies.  The facility began operations in 1984.  Key personnel at the Webberville facility are Mike Rumsey, operations supervisor and John Stefanelli, Regional Operations Manager.\n\nThe facility manufacturers a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 20,000 tons of 10-34-0 fertilizer per year.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately fifteen acres and is situated just north of I-96 on M-52.  The facility is located north of an adjacent industrial park and south of the ADM Countrymark Grain Elevator.  There is one residence on the northwest side of the facility, about 200 yards away.  The nearest neighbor to the east is one mile.  There are a couple of homes on the northeast side, about a \u00c2\u00bd mile away.  To the southwest, there is one unoccupied residence about a \u00c2\u00bd mile away.\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material involved in this process is anhydrous ammonia.  A 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.

      "SummaryText": "is a non-flammable gas.  Anhydrous ammonia has a strong chemical affinity for water and therefore, an abundant supply of water is our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck) to the bulk storage tank.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the bulk storage tank to the processing system occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow.\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These events are very short in duration a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Webberville facility are:\n>  Secondary containment d"
