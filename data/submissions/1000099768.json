The training program must include either hands-on or classroom instruction and appropriate competency testing. Training covers, at a minimum, the connecting and disconnecting of cylinders, including visual inspections and the use of tools, and operation of cylinder handling equipment. All operations personnel responsible for the PLANT must have refresher-training at least annually.\n\nThe training program will include:\nRisk Management Program\nCl2 and/or SO2 Equipment and Process Safety\nCl2 and/or SO2 Operating Procedures\nCl2 and/or SO2 Maintenance Procedures\nEmergency Response Program\nGeneral Safety \n\nMechanical Integrity Program\nPreventative maintenance, inspection and testing of equipment are critical to safe operations, including crane and hoist system and scales. Preventative maintenance includes written procedures and schedules of maintenance, safety training of equipment operators and inspection of equipment per manufactures recommendations.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\nThe plant is located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and utilizes chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide. Chlorine is used for disinfection and sulfur dioxide neutralizes the chlorine before discharge.  The plant has the capacity to store approximately 18,000 pounds (lbs.) of chlorine and/or 12,000 pounds (lbs.) of sulfur dioxide on-site at any one time. Both chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide at the facility are contained in 1-ton containers that are on a standby/on-line basis to ensure the chlor"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe South Canadian Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is owned and maintained by the City of Oklahoma City. However, the City of Oklahoma City has full legal responsibility for the South Canadian WWTP including the authority to make all policy and procedure decisions for this facility.  \n\nThe City of Oklahoma City has contracted day to day operations and maintenance to Inframark.  All decisions concerning the Risk Management Program for this facility shall be made by the City of Oklahoma City or their duly appointed liaison with input from the Inframark RMP Manager and on-site operations personnel. \n\nAlthough there are no active or passive mitigation systems in place at this facility which could limit the effects of an accidental chemical release, the plant employs a number of different programs and policies to prevent an accidental release.  These are detailed in the various sections of the RMP manual but include the following:\n\nSafety Information\nSafety information for the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide system must be maintained as part of this prevention program. The Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for chlorine and sulfur dioxide are included. The SDSs provide information about each of the regulated substance including chemical characteristics, reactivity data, physical hazards, toxicity hazards, exposure limits, thermal and chemical stability, corrosive data, precautions for safe handling and emergency and first aid procedures. An understanding of the characteristics of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are essential to ensuring safe handling of these toxic substances.  Other pertinent safety information for chlorine and sulfur dioxide can be found in the plan. \n\nSpecifications for the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide system components include the crane system. The specifications also include material and design information on the vessels, piping and process equipment used for chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and distribution at the facility. \n\nOperating P"
