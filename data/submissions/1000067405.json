This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Crestwood Panhandle Pipeline LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to Indian Creek Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of NGLs, condensate and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. Indian Creek Gas Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Creek Gas Plant is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant designed to process a maximum of 36 MMSCFD with room for expansion. Natural gas flows into the facility at approximately 260 psig. Processing and sales line pressures range from 900 to 990 psig; therefore, inlet and residue gas require boost compression. The plant consists of the following; field compression, inlet gas compression, separation and filtration, a cryogenic processing unit, residue compression, dehydration, regeneration system, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. The condensate recovered from the inlet gas is stored in one 300 BBL and two 210 BBL tanks and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGLs from the cryogenic unit are sent offsite via pipeline or can be trucked off site. Natural gas from the residue comp"

The facility contains two sources of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture (NGLs) and Pentane (Condensate). \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. \n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Indian Creek Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Indian Creek Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Indian Creek Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.    Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n\n3.    High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\n4.    Plant is staffed 8-hours a day, 7-days a week.  When plant is unattended, notifications go out to the operators electronically from the plant\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.    Berms around atmospheric tanks\n\n2.    Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere to prevent vessels/tanks from rupturing\n\n3.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n4.

Fire extinguishers\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Indian Creek Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel and emergency response organizations in the changes. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Indian Creek Gas Plant is coordinated with the Roberts County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The Hon. Rick Tennant is the contact for the LEPC (806-868-3721).
