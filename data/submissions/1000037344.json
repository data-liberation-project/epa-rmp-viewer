The quantities of isopentane handled at the facility also exceed the threshold quantities in the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management regulations in the 29 CFR 1910.119 and require hazard assessment under that program.\r\n\r\nNorth Brawley uses isopentane as the working fluid in the Rankin cycles for its Ormat Energy Converter Units.  The isopentane is delivered by qualified suppliers, stored in a secure area designed for seismic loads, pumped to the individual units, and circulated and recovered through a closed-loop system.  The plants have leak detection monitors and fire protection equipment installed through the area.  The RMP describes the current methods of delivery, storage, transfer, use and recovery of this flammable substance at the geothermal facility and includes a description of the vapor recovery and evacuation units installed at North Brawley.  The RMP includes additional safety measures to reduce the risk of damage from release of this flammable substance.
