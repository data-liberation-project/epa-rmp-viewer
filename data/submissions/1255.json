The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Brady Grain, Inc. are committed to the\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, or other\nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by our\nfarmer customers for their crop production nutrients.\n\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 126,000 pounds in our 1-12,000 gal. storage tank, and  7-1000 gal. nurse tanks and 5-500 gal. nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the contents of a semi-truck unloading 44,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\ntank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 50,000             \npounds, which represents the volume of a storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by\ndesign standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm ) is .67\nmiles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on most likely potential incident, is a release from\na break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is\n.22 miles.\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions and the standards of the U.S Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of\nanhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the"
