To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of TDI products, the following precautionary measures are being implemented:\n\n     \u0095 Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the transloading of TDI products from railcar to trailers. \n     \u0095 Training program for employees involved in the transloading of TDI to ensure a high level of environmental, health, and safety regulatory compliance, and awareness of the elements of the RMP and release prevention.\n     \u0095 Routine audits and inspections to ensure compliance with established operating procedures, policies, and maintenance of transfer equipment.\n     \u0095 Documented inspection and maintenance programs for the transfer unit, railcars and trailers used for this covered operation.\n\nThe QC West facility utilizes SDSBinderWorks, an electronic SDS Management System, to maintain Safety Data Sheets (SDS\u0092s) for all products transloaded.  A copy of the terminal\u0092s EAP is accessible by emergency responders on a 24 hour basis. In addition to local response agencies, the terminal is subject to inspection from the following agencies:\n     \u0095 Department of Transportation (DOT)\n     \u0095\tEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)\n     \u0095\tArizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ)\n     \u0095\tOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\n\n3.2   Emergency Response Program\nQC West has documented emergency response"

Additionally, this TDI product becomes set up (hardens) when exposed to air or moisture, therefore the chance of a toxic cloud forming is not likely.  If the railcar ruptures, it is more feasible for the 200,000 pounds of TDI product to spill onto the immediate ground and eventually harden. The product is not likely to infiltrate into the ground, and poses minimal risk to groundwater contamination. \n\nAccording to EPA\u0092s MARPLOT program, there are an estimated 166 people residing within the 0.2 mile radius who could be impacted by a release of TDI.  The worst-case scenario analysis and map are included in Appendix E.  \n\n2.2 Alternative Release Scenario\nQC West has evaluated several alternate release scenarios which are considered to have a higher-level probability of occurrence compared to the worst-case scenario; however, these also have a very low probability.  The two types of failure events evaluated for the alternate release scenario involves trailer rupture and hose rupture.  \n\nThe first alternate release scenario includes catastrophic failure, sudden and total failure of an entire trailer (45,000 pounds). Trailer rupture is not a likely scenario, but could result from vandalism/theft, equipment malfunction, or poor tank integrity. General tank integrity includes failures from normal wear or corrosion. The release duration was set to one minute.  As mentioned, this TDI product hardens when exposed to air or moisture, and therefore if the trailer ruptures, it is more likely for the 45,000 pounds of TDI product to spill onto the ground and harden instead of forming a toxic cloud.  \n\nA second alternate release scenario evaluated includes a leak/rupture from the transfer hose, flowing approximately 425 pounds per minu"

The software program RMP*CompTM developed by USEPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was utilized to estimate endpoints for scenarios.  The offsite consequence analysis is required to be updated and reviewed at least once every 5 years (40 CFR \u00a768.36). Reference Appendix D for the RMP Update Log.\n\n2.1   Worst-Case Scenario Analysis\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, QC West has evaluated worst-case release scenarios for TDI. 40 CFR 68.22(a) defines the worst-case scenario to be the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated substances.  The worst-case release quantity is the greatest amount held in a single vessel. For this analysis, the rupture of a single railcar with a volume of 200,000 pounds was used.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, QC West has not considered any passive mitigation measures, including building enclosures, dikes, containment walls, etc.  \n\nUsing the EPA\u0092s RMP*CompTM software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.

Each railcar holds approximately 200,000 pounds of product and can be loaded into trailers each containing 45,000 pounds of product.  \n\nAccording to the List of Regulated Substances under the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68, Appendix A), TDI has a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. Since railcar storage exceeds this threshold, QC West is subject to RMP requirements.  QC West has developed the necessary policies, procedures and work practices for the safe handling of TDI.\n\nQC West has determined this is a Program Level 2 process since public receptors are within the distance to endpoint for a worse-case-release, and handling of TDI is not covered under OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program \u00a729CFR 1910.119. This RMP includes the Prevention Program elements required in 68.48 through 68.60.\n\nThere is potential for there to be anywhere from one to two railcars onsite at any given time.  Each railcar could take approximately one to four weeks to unload. Railcars are never unloaded while connected to the locomotive, however, trailers being loaded with the TDI product are always hooked to the tractor and under active shipping papers.  Any railcar or trailer loaded with TDI will be inspected regularly and documented to ensure there are no spills, leaks, or incidents that could lead to a release. \n\n1.3   RMP Management \nQC West is required to develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program.

(QC West) has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP), pursuant to 40 CFR 68, for the rail to tank truck transloading operations involving Toluene Di-isocyanate (TDI) at the Buckeye, AZ site.  QC West leases a 4.316 acres industrial property (Parcel #400-18-970A) located at 702 N 4th Street in Buckeye, AZ.  Reference Appendix A for a topographic map and Appendix B for a facility site map. \n\nQC West utilizes offices on the property to conduct bulk chemical tank truck dispatch operations, a shop for both tractor and trailer maintenance, and rail spurs for rail transload operations. Transloading operations conducted by QC West at the facility include transloading of both hazardous and non-hazardous materials directly from rail to tank trailers, which are then dispatched for customer delivery.\n\nFacility Location Address:  702 N 4th Street, Buckeye, AZ 85326\nFacility Mailing Address:  102 Pickering Way, Suite 105, Exton, PA 19341\nLatitude/Longitude: 33.377006 N/-112.586294 W\nNAICS Code: Rail- 488210; Truck- 484220/484230\n\nThe terminal facility is usually manned five days a week, Monday through Friday, 5AM-4PM PST.  Start and stop times for the shop and transload operations can vary depending on the season and business volume. During the fire season, the site could be manned up to 7 days a week. \n\nThe entire property leased by QC West is equipped with a fence.  Reference the map in Appendix B. The gates are locked outside of active business hours.  Should a driver need access to the yard after hours, they use a code to open the gate. The facility fence line is inspected regularly to ensure function and stability. Both Union Pacific and Perimeter Solutions have access to the yard at all times, as they sublease space from QC West.  These relationships have been in place for over 15 years and there have never been any incidents that would warrant concern. QC West is currently working on installing a wir"
