      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been completed by Regulatory Compliance Services, Inc. (RCS, Inc.) for GENCO in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). GENCO operates a warehouse facility with hazardous substances that are covered under 112(r).\n\nRCS, Inc. has been retained by GENCO to investigate this facility's need to implement a Risk Management Plan. RCS, Inc. reviewed Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for all products. Following the product review, four (4) products stored at the facility contained constituents that were listed under RMP.\n\nThe second stage in completing this plan was to investigate the storage history for each constituent. After review of the inventories, the investigation revealed that an aerosol propellant mixture containing Isobutane (propane) exceeded the threshold quantity listed in 112(r).\n\nThe RMP requirements were designed to facilitate communication to responders and the public in the event of a catastrophic release of the listed substances. These requirements also insure the continuing improvement and safety of each identified process. Major facilities needing to comply with 112(r) may be defined as; a facility that is used to store large volumes of highly hazardous substances for use in manufacturing, treatment processes or bulk storage. Some of the requirements are not applicable to a closed container non-bulk facility. All items that are not applicable are provided with an explanation in the attachments to this plan.\n\nThe RMP has three (3) different models to follow when completing a plan. The models are based on types of products, processes, and quantities. This plan meets the requirement of Program 1. \n\nUnder Program 1 GENCO is not required develop a plan in response  to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119."
