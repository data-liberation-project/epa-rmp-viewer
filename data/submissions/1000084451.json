To design and develop products that can be manufactured, transported, used and disposed of or recycled safely.\n\n?    To work with customers, carriers, suppliers, distributors and contractors to foster the safe and secure use, transport and disposal of chemicals and provide hazard and risk information that can be accessed and applied in their operations and products.\n\n?    To design and operate our facilities in a safe, secure and environmentally sound manner.\n\n?    To instill a culture throughout all levels of our organization to continually identify, reduce and manage process safety risks.\n\n?    To promote pollution prevention, minimization of waste and conservation of energy and other critical resources at every stage of the life cycle of our products.\n\n?    To cooperate with governments at all levels and organizations in the development of effective and efficient safety, health, environmental and security laws, regulations and standards.\n\n?

Manual and automatic fire suppression systems\n\n?    Site-wide preventive maintenance and mechanical integrity programs\n\n?    Use of recommissioning checklists\n\nChemical-specific measures include:\n\n?    Use of combustible gas analyzers and excess flow valves on the 2-methylpropene storage tank\n\n?    Use of ammonia detectors and excess flow valves on the anhydrous ammonia tank\n\n?    In-tank automatic foam suppression systems in 1,3-pentadiene storage tanks\n\n?    Fusible links which melt in a fire at the hydrogen storage area as well as piping all vents and reliefs to a safe location \n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThe Jefferson Site experienced one accident in the past five years.  The incident occurred on June 6, 2015 and involved the release of 150 lbs. of 1,3-pentadiene.  Residents were instructed to shelter in place as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program\n\n\n\nThe Jefferson Site maintains an on-site Emergency Response Team which is trained to respond to fires, accidental releases, and confined space entry rescues.
