      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nThe Dunes Community Development District (Dunes CDD) is the governmental agency responsible for utility service to the Hammock Dunes, Yacht Harbor Village and Ocean Hammock communities.  These communities are located in Palm Coast, Flagler County, Florida and comprise approximately 2100 acres.  The Dunes CDD is generally bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by State Road A1A, on the north by Malacompra Road, and the south by the Intracoastal Waterway.\nThe Dunes CDD owns and operates a water treatment facility (WTF) and a wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) located at 101 Jungle Hut Road.  The Dunes WTF & WWTF site is approximately 24 acres and is centrally located in the community.   Treatment of the wastewater includes biological, physical, and chemical treatment.  Wastewater treatment involves disinfection of filtered and biologically treated wastewater.  The disinfectant utilized in this process is chlorine gas.  The WWTF also uses chlorine gas to aid in filter maintenance and to improve reclaimed water quality prior to use.  Additionally, the water treatment facility (WTF) uses chlorine to disinfect potable drinking water after treatment in a reverse osmosis process.  Chlorine is also used in the degassification/odor control scrubber process. \n\nThe Dunes WTF&WWTF has a dedicated chemical handling facility located on-site.  Chlorine gas is stored on the site in three one-ton containers.  The maximum chlorine inventory at the site is 6,000 lbs.  The following characteristics of the Dunes CDD WTF and WWTF subject the facility to Rule 40 CFR Part 68, which requires development and implementation of a Risk Management Program (RMP):\nThe facility is a stationary source; and\nThe facility handles, uses, and stores a toxic substance regulated by 40 CFR 68.130 (e.g. chlorine gas); and\nThe handling, use, and storage of chlorine meet the definition of a process; and\nThe chlorine is present in quantities above the threshold quantities esta"

This is the highest level program and requires the most extensive risk management plan.  The criteria for Program Level three follow:\nPublic receptors are within the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case scenario release;\nThe process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard since the chemical use, chlorine is included in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.119 and the quantity stored and handled exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine of 1,500 lbs;\nThe Level 3 Risk Management Program is basically comprised of three sections: Hazard Assessment, Prevention Program, and Emergency Response Plan.  \nThe Hazard Assessment for a toxic gas involves modeling the consequences of at least two release scenarios, the worst-case and an alternative case.  The worst case scenario involves the largest container of the regulated substance being released into the environment over the period of ten minutes.  The Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (EPA) air model RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used to simulate the worst case scenario.  The model uses input data to generate the estimated distance from the point of release to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic endpoint is defined for chlorine gas as the point where the concentration of chlorine gas in the air is 0.0087 mg/L.  For the worst case scenario, the release rate was 110 lbs/minute and the distance to the toxic endpoint was 0.9 miles (distance from the chemical handling facility).  \nThe alternative case release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case and has off-site consequences (e.g. the distance to the toxic endpoint is further than the distance to the site boundary).  In the alternative release case, the RMP*Comp model allows the user to enter more site-specific data, including consideration of active mitigation devices (these were not allowed for the worst case scenario).  Two alternative ca"

This section is the heart of the RMP and accounts for a large portion of the document's thickness.  The Prevention Program includes detailed information and discussion regarding the management system at the facility; five-year accident history; process safety information review; process hazard analysis; procedures for operation, training, maintenance, management of change, compliance audit, incident investigation, employee participation, and hot work; and contractor selection.  The Prevention Program provides documented guidance to facility staff regarding day to day operation regarding chlorine storage, handling, and use.  The Prevention Program is intended to educate staff and thereby reduce the probability of release due to improper operations, inadequate maintenance, ignorance of the hazards, or lack of safety awareness.  \nThe Dunes WTF&WWTF has employed chlorine gas as a disinfectant since 1985.   There have been no uncontrolled releases in chlorine gas that caused injury or death to on-site or off-site persons.  The chlorination system, which uses chlorine gas at the facility, is vacuum-operated.  The system employs active mitigation devices which include vacuum induced gas withdrawal, fail-close valves (vacuum regulator), secondary check valves, isolation valves, sensors (high/low vacuum, low water pressure, chlorine gas detector) which are connected to an alarm system, pressure relief valves, ventilation systems, and automatic container switchover system (via vacuum regulator).  These active mitigation devices have attributed to the successful and safe operation of the system since startup.  The existing system is capable of continuing to provide safe utilization of chlorine gas as a disinfectant.   Improvements to the facility will incl"

The plan provides detailed how-to information regarding movement, notification, personnel accountability, site control, release remediation, first aid, personal protective equipment, and coordination with professional emergency responders.  The facility staff is primarily responsible for protection of on-site persons and notification of outside organizations that will takes steps to provide protection for off-site persons.  The Flagler County Department of Emergency Services will coordinate off-site activities and release remediation once contacted by the 9-1-1 dispatcher."
