      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n    At the turn of this century water borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine\u00bfs introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\n    The use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n    As an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n    The South Central Regional Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Board (SCRWT&DB) has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  The SCRWT&DB\u00bfs track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, the SCRWT&DB has taken a comprehensive approach t"

The facility\u00bfs mission is to protect public health by treating and disposing of wastewater.  Approximately 2,000 pounds per day of chlorine gas is used to disinfect the treated wastewater effluent prior to disposal.  Chlorine is also used at the facility for odor control, to control sludge bulking, and to disinfect highly treated reuse water which is used for irrigation.  A maximum of 38,000 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site.  The chlorine is stored as a gas that is liquefied under pressure in containers that contain 2,000 pounds each. \n                                                                                                                                                                          CHLORINE PROCESS SAFETY EQUIPMENT\n    The chlorine system at the SCRWTP facility is a liquid feed system.  Typically, there are seven containers of chlorine connected to the liquid header.  A manually operated switchover system allows for switching from one bank of three containers to another bank of four containers. Liquid chlorine is drawn from a single one-ton chlorine container through the liquid header into the evaporator.  The liquid chlorine in the evaporator is contained in a pressure vessel.  A hot water bath surrounding the pressure vessel transfers heat to the chlorine, which in turn vaporizes into a gas. Chlorine gas flows under pressure from the evaporator to the vacuum regulator-check unit (VRCU).  At the VRCU, the gas pressure is reduced to a slight vacuum.\n    As water flows through the injector, the vacuum created by the pressure differential draws the chlorine gas through the rem"

The gas flow rate through the chlorinator is indicated on the chlorinator\u00bfs rotameter.  At the injector, the chlorine gas is mixed with water to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then distributed to the application points.\n    The chlorine storage room is completely enclosed in a building.  A perimeter leak detector will activate an emergency chlorine scrubber, shutoff the building ventilation system, close the building louvers and overhead rollup doors, and activate a visible alarm and two audible alarms.  The scrubber is capable of neutralizing 2,100 pounds of chlorine (i.e., one full container of chlorine).  The chlorine scrubber system is tested on a weekly basis to ensure trouble free operation.  In addition, all preventive maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is performed by plant staff.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OVERVIEW\n    Chlorine is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\nThe primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n* A five-year accident history\n* An off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case and alternative release scenario\n* A comprehensive prevention program to minimize risks (i.e., minimize the potential for a release)\n* An emergency response program to ensure that an accidental release is appropriately handled\n* An overall management program to supervise the implementation of the RMP\n    Following development of the RMP submitted in year 1999, the facility must submit a RMP Update to the EPA by June 21, 2004.  The RMP update, which is presented every five years, reports any process changes or if a new process is added. The OSHA"

The prevention program is a key component to reducing the risk associated with a potential chlorine gas release.

Effective SOPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the system and in preventing accidental releases.\n    The purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment.  An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental chlorine releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment.  The SCRWT&DB mechanical integrity program includes maintenance, inspection, and testing procedures and schedules along with maintenance personnel training.\n    Knowledgeable well-trained personnel are essential to preventing and mitigating the effects of accidental chemical releases. The SCRWT&DB training program ensures that personnel working on or near the chlorine system are adequately trained in operation and maintenance procedures and the appropriate response actions to an accidental chlorine release.\n    The process hazard analysis (PHA) is a valuable risk reduction tool that outlines deficiencies in equipment and procedures, identifies potential system failure modes, and provides recommendations for system and operational improvements.

      "SummaryText": "munication that are necessary to effectively respond to and mitigate a potential chlorine gas release.\n    In the event of a chlorine gas release, a detector located in the storage area, will detect the presence of chlorine gas.  The detector will activate audible and visual alarms throughout the facility to give warning to plant staff.  In addition, the detectors well activate an emergency chlorine scrubber system that has the capacity to neutralize the release of 2,100 pounds of chlorine.  The facility emergency response program includes procedures for notifying the local hazardous materials (hazmat) teams of the incident and procedures for evacuating the facility.  Facility staff have coordinated with the local hazmat team and/or fire department to ensure that they are fully trained and equipped to quickly respond to an incident.\n                                                                                                                                                                           PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVED SAFETY\n    Based on the Process Hazard Analysis updated on February 27, 2004 there are no recommended changes to improve the safety of the chlorine system."
