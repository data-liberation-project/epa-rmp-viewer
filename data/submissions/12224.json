      "SummaryText": "A. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe use of Chlorine (Cl2) and Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) in our halides \nmanufacturing facility is operated and maintained in a safe and \nresponsible manner.  We have implemented release prevention programs \nand emergency response policies in order to preserve and protect the \nhealth of employees.  These programs and policies also serve as \nprotection of human health and the environment of the communities \nsurrounding U.S. Vanadium.  \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur Niagara facility includes a halides manufacturing process.  Cl2 and \nTiCl4 are the only toxic chemicals regulated under the RMP Rule by Part \n68 that U.S. Vanadium has on-site as part of a process.  U.S. Vanadium \nhas no flammable substances regulated by Part 68.\n\nC. Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nReleases of Cl2 and TiCl4 have been modeled as follows:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario \u0016 Cl2\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a release of chlorine reaches the toxic \nendpoint at a radius of 4.5 miles and would reach a residential population \nof approximately 77,000.  Public receptors affected by this release are \nresidences, schools, hospitals, public parks, and businesses.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario \u0016 TiCl4\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a release of titanium tetrachloride reaches a \nradius from the site is 0.61 miles to the toxic endpoint. The public \nreceptors located within this release radius are residences, recreation \nareas, and major industrial sites.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u0016 Cl2\n\nThe alternate case or more-likely scenario for a release of chlorine will \nreach a radius of 0.58 miles.  The public receptors located within this \nrelease radius are residences, recreation areas, and major industrial \nsites.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u0016 TiCl4\n\nThe alternate case or more-likely scenario for a release of titanium \ntetrachloride is reached at 0.17 miles.  The public receptors affected by \nthis alternative scen"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-\nSpecific Prevention Steps\n\nAs part of our general prevention program, we have integrated chemical-\nspecific prevention steps that help minimize the possibility of any leak of a \nhazardous substance that poses a potential danger both onsite and/or \noffsite.  Our program includes the following steps and programs that lead \nto successful risk reduction and accident prevention:\n\n1) Process safety information\n2) Process hazard analysis\n3) Operating procedures\n4) Training\n5) Mechanical Integrity\n6) Management of change\n7) Pre-startup review\n8) Compliance audits\n9) Incident investigation\n10) Employee participation\n11) Hot work permit\n12) Contractors\n\nE. Five-year Accident History\n\nAs a result of U.S. Vanadium\u0012s programs on safety and accidental release \nprevention, we have had no reportable releases in the past 5 years involving \nsubstances covered under Part 68.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\nOur emergency response plan provides key background, planning and \ntraining for the handling of and responding to releases of regulated \nsubstances.  The plan also defines procedures for proper notification of \noff-site public receptors (residences) in an emergency situation.  \nProcedures for notification of local authorities with which our plan is \ncoordinated are also given in the plan.  The main objective involved in the \nimplementation of this plan is the protection of workers, the public and the \nenvironment during emergency situations.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nU.S. Vanadium conducts Process Hazard Analyses (PHA\u0012s) that develop \na list of suggestions for the improvement of process safety.  These PHA\u0012s \nare performed every 5 years or when a process is changed, whichever \ncomes first.  The list of suggestions produced from the PHA is used to \nhelp improve safety for the employees, the pubic and the environment by \nreducing the risk of potential releases of regu"
