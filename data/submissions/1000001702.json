As part of this commitment, Ohio Refining Division has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Ohio Refining Division under the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit risk management plan (RMPlan) information describing the risk management program at Ohio Refining Division.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule .\n\n1.1.1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOhio Refining Division is committed to the safety of Ohio Refining Division workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Ohio Refining Division implements controls designed to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Ohio Refining Division evaluates each situation, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, requests assistance from outside emergency responders including the local fire department to help control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  Ohio Refining Division, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the fire department have also established a system to use for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\nThe Division Manager has overall responsibility"

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Division Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the Division organization chart maintained by the Division Manager's staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Division\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division PSM Coordinator.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Division PSM Coordinator.  The division emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Environment Safety and Security Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other Division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis with responsibilities for carrying out their respective parts.\n\n1.1.2.\tThe MPC LLC Ohio Refining Division Regulated Substances\n\nOhio Refining Division is a refinery and petroleum products facility located in Canton, Ohio.  We use crude petroleum as our feed material and make a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, asphalt, sulfur and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Some of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lb.  In total, we have twelve process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  The units are listed in the data element section.\nOhio Refining Division also handles two toxic substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be co"

Because processes at the Ohio Refining Division that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the program elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Ohio Refining Division, where necessary, to address EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n1.1.3.1.\tEmployee Participation\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including program development.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams, incident investigation teams and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all RMP information created as part of the Ohio Refining Division accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Ohio Refining Division and addresses each accident prevention program element.

These initiatives include safety meetings and a health and safety committee to promote both process and personal safety. All division personnel attend the safety meetings and the health and safety committee has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and Division management.\n\n1.1.3.2.\tProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Ohio Refining Division are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written process safety information plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Ohio Refining Division has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) as part of the operating procedures.  The Ohio Refining Division ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \nThe Ohio Refining Division also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information abo"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\nThe Ohio Refining Division primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team has considered offsite effects of potential accidental releases as part of all PHAs conducted since 1996.\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Ohio Refining Division per"
