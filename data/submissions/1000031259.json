      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Burgess Norton Manufacturing Company (BN) facility located at 500 Western Avenue in Geneva, Illinois (the Facility), is a manufacturer of precision powder metal products for the automotive and outdoor power equipment industries. The Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for site personnel, the community, contractors and the environment. To meet this commitment, systems have been established to help ensure safe operation of the processes of this Facility. One component of these systems is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that has been established and implemented to assist in managing the risks involved with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia, the only hazardous substance stored and used at the Facility that is regulated pursuant to Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 68 (40 CFR 68).\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in heat treating operations at the Facility. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a liquid state in one pressurized 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tank (AST) that holds up to 51,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The pressurized anhydrous ammonia AST is located outside along the west boundary of the Facility property. Ancillary piping connects the anhydrous ammonia AST to dissociator units and heat-treat furnaces located inside the production building. Ancillary piping contains less than 1 pound of anhydrous ammonia. Including AST and ancillary piping storage quantities, a maximum of 51,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site. The RMP applies to facilities that operate a process which involves a chemical stored onsite at or above specified threshold quantities (TQ) listed in 40 CFR 68.130. Anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) is listed with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds under 40 CFR 68.130. Therefore, pursuant to 40 CFR 68, the Facility is required to implement a RMP because anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in quantities equal to or greater tha"

Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.10(d)(2), RMP Program 3 requirements apply to facilities that are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements outlined under 29 CFR 1910.119. The PSM standard applies to facilities that operate a process which involves a chemical stored onsite at or above specified threshold quantities listed in 29 CFR 1910.119, Appendix A. Anhydrous ammonia is listed with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds under Appendix A. Therefore, because anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in quantities greater than 10,000 pounds and is used as a gas in the heat treat process, the Facility is subject to PSM and RMP Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\nStationary Source & Regulated Substance Handled\r\nThe Facility is a stationary source that stores and uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7), a regulated substance (40 CFR 68.130, Table 3). Anhydrous ammonia is piped in a gaseous state to dissociator units where it is broken down to its elemental components, hydrogen and nitrogen, and used in the metal heat treat operations at the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the heat-treat furnaces to create a required atmosphere for metallurgical processes. Tanner Industries, Inc. (TI) owns the anhydrous ammonia AST system including the tank and outlet valves. BN is responsible for maintaining the pipe delivery system connecting the AST system to the dissociator units and heat treat furnaces. TI performs all maintenance activities on the AST system, not including surface painting. BN leases the tank and purchases anhydrous ammonia on a regular basis from TI. Consequently, TI is responsible for the safe operation and maintenance of the AST system and is also obligated to maintain compliance with environmental and safety requirements that apply to the AST system.

      "SummaryText": "nhydrous ammonia release from the anhydrous ammonia system or any other environmental, health and safety emergency, TI and/or facility employees will immediately evacuate the affected area and notify the following parties at the provided numbers:\r\n\r\n1. Jurisdictional Emergency Response Team (911)\r\n2. State Emergency Response Committee (1-800-782-7860)\r\n3. Kane County LEPC (1-630-232-5985)\r\n\r\nA Management Representative must meet the first responders when they first arrive to provide key process information. A meeting point should be provided during the 911 phone call. \r\n\r\nCoordinating emergency response efforts also includes providing the fire department with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWhile a worst-case release is not expected to occur, as required by the regulation, worst-case and alternative release scenarios were evaluated to estimate the potential offsite consequences to the public or the environment from the potential accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The toxic endpoint concentration for anhydrous ammonia is 200ppm or 0.14 mg/L. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios were determined using current RMP*CompTM computer software developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and U.S.EPA. RMP*CompTM performs calculations described in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document published by U.S.EPA.\r\n\r\nDistances to the toxic endpoint, defined by U.S.EPA as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protection action, were estimated for worst-case and alternative case releas"

      "SummaryText": "e scenarios. The worst-case release is defined as the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia system. The alternative release is defined as a release that has potential off-site impacts.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nUsing U.S.EPA\u00bfs RMP*CompTM to determine the worst-case scenario, the calculated toxic vapor endpoint distance was based on the loss of the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank over a ten minute time period, 51,400 pounds. The worst-case release toxic endpoint distance is estimated to be 1.2 miles. The worst-case dispersion parameters are atmospheric stability class F and 1.5 meters per second wind speed.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nUsing U.S.EPA\u00bfs RMP*CompTM to determine the alternative release scenario, the calculated toxic vapor endpoint distance was based on a toxic vapor release caused by a pipe tearing apart from the anhydrous ammonia tank system. Based on a tank hole 4-square inches in , the alternative release over a ten minute time period was 3,060 pounds. The alternative release toxic endpoint distance is estimated to be 0.6 miles. The alternative release dispersion parameters are atmospheric stability class D and 3.0 meters per second wind speed.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe safety improvement program includes internal safety audits, which are performed on a regulatr basis. RMP updates are required every 5 years or within 6 months following a revised Hazard Review, Offsite Consequence Analysis, or Program designation. Compliance Audits are required every 3 years. Hazard Reviews require updating at least once every 5 years. Any Incident Investigation Summaries shall be retained for 5 years."
