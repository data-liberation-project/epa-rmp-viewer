LCRA has reviewed its obligations under the USEPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act).  In response to these requirements, LCRA notes that there are two obligations incumbent on the operations at it's facility.\n1. ?112(r) ? Purpose and General Duty Clause ? The essence of the general duty clause is that an \nowner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental \nobligation to ensure safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to \nappropriately manage the situation.  LCRA takes this obligation very seriously and intends to be not \nonly a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness.\n2. Risk Management Plan ? LCRA operates a water treatment facility that stores and uses chlorine \nin excess of thresholds specified in the RMP Rule.  Even prior to the promulgation of the RMP rule, \nLCRA management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by storage and use of \nchlorine. LCRA has established programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for \nemergency response in the event of a release. These programs are documented and described in \nthe Risk Management Plan. \nLCRA has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate any chlorine release.  In addition \nto maintenance, training and inspection procedures, LCRA has an active monitoring and alarm \nsystem that will detect a release and sound a local alarm.  An emergency alarm is triggered when \nthe chlorine level in the atmosphere is above 3 parts per million (ppm).  Under these circumstances, an AutoDialer begins calling the Public Safety Communications Center and the operations personnel. \nLCRA has extensively coordinated with local emergency responders including the Hudson Bend Fire \nDepartment and the Local Emergency Planning Committe"
