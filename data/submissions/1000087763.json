The butane is used for injecting into crude oil thus blending the oil to a desired viscosity. The facility has extensive operating procedures covering all facets of the operation and utilizes open-path gas detection throughout the facility to monitor for early release of flammable substances. \n\n\n\nA worst-case scenario involving the complete loss of one (1) butane vessel was modeled and resulted in an impact distance of 0.7 miles. an Alternate scenario which involved the complete loss of all six (6) butane vessels was modeled which resulted in a 1.2-mile impacted radius. A rupture or leak of the pipeline between the butane vessels and blending injectors will be confined to the facility with a 0.1-mile radius.\n\n\n\nThe Terminal is a new facility and does not have any previous spills or releases. The Terminal has developed extensive Facility Response Plans (FRP), Emergency Action Plans EAP), and Spill Prevention and Countermeasure Controls (SPCC) that are available as stand-alone documents. \n\n\n\nThe Terminal will coordinate response needs with Local Emergency Planning and Response Organizations to determine how the stationary source is addressed in the Community Emergency Response Plan and to ensure that Local Response Organizations are aware of the regulated substances at the Terminal, their quantities, the risks presented by covered processes, and the resources and capabilities at the Terminal to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance. Coordination will occur at least annually, and more frequently if necessary, to address changes at the stationary source; in the Terminal's Emergency Response and/or Emergency Action Plan; and/or in the Community Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nCoordination will include providing to the Local Emergency Planning and Response Organizations the Terminal"
