This commitment is demonstrated by Metl-Span's comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  It is Metl-Span's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such releases were to occur, the Mattoon Fire Department would response to the release. Metl-Span has coordinated emergency response actions with the Mattoon Fire Department and has provided information to the Coles County LEPC regarding regulated substances our plant.\r\n\r\n1.2 \tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a768.155(b)) \r\n\r\nMetl-Span manufacturers Insulated Metal Panels (IMPs) at its facility in Mattoon, Illinois. IMPs are lightweight composite exterior wall and roof panels with metal skins and an insulating foam core. Three raw materials are used to produce the foam core of the panels: diphenyl methane diisocyanurate (MDI), polyol, and the blowing agent 1,1-difluoroethane. The 1,1-difluroethane is the only regulated substance present at the facility. The maximum inventory of 1,1-difluoroethane that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process and operational requirements, is 75,000 pounds (rounded up to two significant digits for reporting purposes). The 1,1-difluoroethane is stored in 12,000-gallon bulk storage tank.\r\n\r\n1.3 \tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a768.155(c))  \r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. The pentane process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMetl-Span has compiled the relevant"

Included within this compilation is the electrical classification, materials of construction, safety systems, ventilation system design, and design codes and standards employed.  The information contained within the Process Safety Information is utilized in conducting process hazard analysis.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The hazard and operability (HAZOP) Guideword and What-If/Checklists methods were used to carry out these analyses . The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures  \r\n\r\nMetl-Span maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address the various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  \r\n \r\nTraining\r\n\r\nOur facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training on operating procedures is provided at least every three years, and more frequently as needed.  \r\n \r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nMetl-Span carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modifications.  \r\n \r\nPre-Startup Reviews\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification of established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Metl-Span. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.  \r\n \r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nMetl-Span conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being implemented.
