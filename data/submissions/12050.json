      "SummaryText": "The Big Butte Springs Disinfection Facilty is one of two drinking water treatment facilities owned and operated by Medford Water Commission.   The treatment facility is located at the Big Butte Springs source of supply complex approximately 5 miles east of Butte Falls, Oregon.  The Big Butte Springs is the primary water source for the community water system and is used year-round,  serving nearly 95,000 persons in Medford and surrounding communities of Central Point, Phoenix, Jacksonville, Eagle Point and White City.\n\nThe Big Butte Springs facility uses Chlorine as a primary disinfectant to ensure that no harmful bacteria are present in the public drinking water supply.   Continuous disinfection is a critical process in drinking water treatment.  Gas chlorination systems have been operated at the Big Butte Springs without incident since the 1950's.  The present facility was placed into service in 1994 and incorporates modern design concepts and state-of-the-art process equipment and controls.   \n\nChlorine is transported to the site in one-ton containers by truck.  Containers are off-loaded and handled at  the facility with a monorail hoist.  The containers hold 2,000 pounds of Chlorine (gas liquified by pressure) when full; a maximum of 7 full containers (14,000 pounds) are on site at any given time.  Containers are placed onto scale units and connected to the feed system.   Chlorine gas is delivered into the water treatment process via a vacuum system; all feed system components operate under vacuum conditions as Chlorine exits the containers.  Leak detection systems and a gas scrubber are included.     \n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to minimize the risks associated with Chlorine processes.   The prevention program components include a systematic process hazard analysis,  strict operation and maintenance procedures, and training.   \n\nThis Risk Management Plan has evaluated worst-case and alternative release (more realistic)"

      "SummaryText": " scenarios to more fully understand the potential off-site consequences of an accidental release of Chlorine.   Due to it's remote and forested location, the potential effects from the worst-case release of 2000# within 10 minutes were minimal.  The distance to the toxic endpoint, 3 PPM for Chlorine, was determined to be 0.9 miles from the facility.  Excluding the on-site supervisor's home,  there are 4 private residences and approximately 3.5 miles of public road near the perimeter of the affected radius.  The alternative release scenario modeled a container valve leak inside the facility.  With the building containment and gas scrubber mitigation, the affected radius was determined to be <0.1 miles.              \n    \nAn emergency action plan is also in place protect workers and the public in the unlikely event of an accidental release of Chlorine.   This plan encompasses a wide range of response actions depending upon the severity of the release situation.   At the lowest level, Medford Water Commission personnel will react to contain or repair minor leaks.  A significant release would involve Jackson County Fire District #3 and ultimately the Southern Oregon Regional Haz-mat Team #8. \n \nThe Board of Water Commissioners, management and plant operations staff are confident the policies and procedures in place allow for the safe operation of Chlorine disinfection processes at its' treatment facilities.  Further information may be obtained from the Water Commission office located at 200 S. Ivy Street, Medford, OR  97501"
