There have been no RMP-defined accidental releases of hazardous material from Enterprises' Propylene Processing Facility within the last five years. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu group, which includes the Mont Belvieu Police, fire department, and Emergency Medical Service as well as the Chambers County Emergency Management system.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nEnterprise personnel are continuously reviewing and improving our PSM systems, especially in the areas of operating procedures and training programs.  Employees are encouraged to submit suggestions or recommendations to improve process or unit operating safety.  All suggestions are reviewed and, if a probable safety improvement can be expected, the suggestion is implemented.  The following projects or programs are currently being installed or re-evaluated to improve safety of the Propylene Splitter III facility:\r\n\r\n*  A new Control Room is being constructed which will place workers farther from the hazards of the process.\r\n*  Additional gas detection is being installed."

We have a training program in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the plant, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  We train, use and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.  All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\r\n\r\nWe have an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies in the process equipment prior to any incident.\r\n\r\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is detected, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\r\n\r\nRecords are maintained for all significant accidental releases of hazardous chemicals that occur at the facility.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\r\n\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, no toxic substances were identified at Enterprise's Propylene Processing Facility as meeting the criteria or threshold limits of the RMP Rule.  Hence, there was no need to conduct a worst-case scenario (WCS) with respect to toxic substances. \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable materials from Enterprise's Propylene Processing Facility involves the rupture or failure of the Splitter Charge Tank, which contains a mixture of propane and propylene.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this scenario were to occur.  All Emergency Response protocols would be in effect.  There would be no offsite environmental impact in this scenario due to the material being consumed on site.  Further details on the Splitter III worst case scenario are contained in the Risk Management Program registration document.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\nThis scenario would be mitigated by means of the emergency shutdown system and the activation of the emergency response team.
