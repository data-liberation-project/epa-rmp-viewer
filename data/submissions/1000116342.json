A replacement cylinder will be ordered when the active chlorine cylinder has been reduced to less than 500 pounds of contained chlorine. The cylinder replacement procedures are based on the manufacturer's recommendations. Employees also review operating procedures and maintenance tasks daily, or as needed per manufacturer's recommendations. The required prevention program for our facility is Level 2, although we utilize the Process Safety Management protocol from Level 3 guidance. Lockout/tagout procedures are used to help prevent an accidental release of chlorine. When maintenance is conducted on the chlorination system, the Water Operator approves the proper installation of materials, and complete installation with final approval of changes in the system by the Mississippi State Health Department. Any change in maintenance procedures is reviewed and approved by the same operator. All operators at this facility are knowledgeable in the proper start-up and shut-down procedures for the water treatment operations. All components of the chlorination system are visually inspected at least daily.\n\nOur emergency response (action) plan was developed with the assistance of FC&E Engineering, LLC, Engineering Service Consulting Engineers, Harcros Chemical Chlorine Response Team, the Bovina Fire Department, and the Warren County Emergency Management Agency. If a chlorine release occurs at the 101 Birdsong Road, Vicksburg Mississippi location a chlorine detector will activate an outside siren system. The water treatment plant operator detecting the alarm will notify the CWD General Manager who will get personnel organized for an emergency action. On-duty personnel have SCBA equipment that they will use to enter the confined space (due to a potentially toxic atmosphere) in which the chlorine cylinders are stored and determine the extent of release. They can perform an emergency action by"

Personnel at the 101 Birdsong Road location, the Harcros Chlorine Response Team, the Bovina Fire Department, and Warren County Emergency Management Agency will help organize the Emergency Response activities, and will start the notification and evacuation of the potentially affected population. The release will be slowed by employees not starting the manual vent system in the chlorine room until notification to the 911 response system is made, and evacuation activities begin. This will not prevent chlorine from being released from a cylinder, but will contain the release for some time to facilitate orderly response.\n\nActive mitigation of a release will consist of manual shutoffs, automatic vacuum feed chlorine system shut-down, and water deluge using fire protection water hoses. Alternative passive mitigation would consist of continued release into the enclosed space of the chlorine building pending emergency response. It is assumed that the contents of the cylinder would be released as vapor, as there is no activity involving the liquid port on the chlorine cylinder. The area surrounding the facility is generally rural and consists of relatively rolling terrain with sparse vegetation. There are commercial and public facilities near the water treatment plant that will be notified as required.\n\nThere have been no accidents of accidental releases of chlorine from this facility in the past 5 years. The automatic vacuum feed system helps prevent/limit potential releases of chlorine that could escape during operational periods. Operators of the chlorination system are required to check instruments, cylinders, feed lines, etc. on a daily basis to aid in the prevent"

This facility falls under the NAICS Code 22131. The last review and update of the safety information for this facility was performed on August 30, 2024. The facility is subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) for compressed gas cylinder storage; the American National Standards Institute (ANSI); and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). These standards, along with the applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards (compliance not required for municipal facilities), have been implemented through written policy and procedure manuals. Even though this is a municipal facility and not governed by OSHA regulations, the Culkin WTP incorporates Process Safety Management protocols into its prevention program (level 3 guidance). To prevent/limit releases, this facility operates the chlorine feed system on an automatic vacuum feed system, manual shut off valves, and delayed manual vent fan operation to control the potential release of chlorine from the enclosed chlorine facility. The vacuum feed regulators are cylinder-mounted; therefore, the system will shut off the chlorine feed from the cylinders if there is a feed line leak anywhere from the chlorine tank valve to the injector. Employees at the Culkin WTP perform maintenance checks on all chlorine system components involved with the chlorination system on a daily basis. These checks involve reading and recording the chlorine cylinder weights, inspecting the cylinders visually, examining the feed lines, valves, and regulators, etc. The employees at the Culkin WTP practice safe handling of chlorine and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for operational and maintenance procedures. All employees who work on or with the chlorine system are trained in the"
