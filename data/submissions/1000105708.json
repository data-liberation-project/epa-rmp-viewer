The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated (annually) with the Bangor Township Fire Department and Bay County Emergency Management to maintain a relationship with first responders. Tours and drills with members of local emergency response organizations are held routinely (annually at a minimum.) These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the Terminal. The Bangor Township Fire Department has participated in the initial PSM/RMP training session for this system.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMPLX is continually striving to make the Bay City Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors and community.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, MPLX looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements.  All process safety events (as defined in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed, and investigated via root-cause analysis (ex. TapRooT), as appropriate.  The Bangor Township Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response training, coordination, and/or drills.  Additionally, MPLX will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns."

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release does occur, a Smart Plan/Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is in place for the Facility with response activities being coordinated with the Bangor Township Fire Department and Bay County LEPC.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Bay City Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal maintains records for all significant accidental chemical releases inclusive of root-cause analyses and associated follow-up actions, where appropriate. There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting in consequences covered under the EPA RMP reporting requirements.  The Terminal tracks all process incidents per API 754 guidance.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Bay City Terminal is identified as a non-responding facility.

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Bay City Terminal.\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) 90,000-gallon storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack or on-site product storage tanks. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid and Bartec-Benke Analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Bay City Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nOur accidental release prevention and emergency planning/response programs help the Bay City Terminal effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment.
