If an emergency were to occur we will notify the Statesville Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a rotational molding plant.  We mold plastic products used for refuse collection, material handling, and other retail and commerical products.  We us propane as a backup for natural gas use as the energy source in our rotational molding machine ovens.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of our 30,000 gal. propane storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to endpoint extends offsite.  Our alternative release scenario is a 5 minute release due to a break in a 1 in pipe leading to a 10 minute leak resulting in a vapor cloud fire..\n\nThe propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state laws.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused death, injuries, propery or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system we will notify the Statesville Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.\n\nWe have no immediate plans to make improvements or changes to our safety program."
