All employees who are involved with the ammonia system are trained to understand the safety and health hazards of this refrigerant and the refrigeration system.  Each employee is properly trained in:  Understanding MSDSs; routine refrigeration system operation; emergency refrigeration system operation; emergency and normal refrigeration safety procedures; and their role in the emergency response plan.  Management has also established a procedure to ensure that contractor and maintenance personnel are trained.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive maintenance and mechanical integrity program covering the equipment and system components is strictly followed.  The mechanical integrity program includes planned maintenance and quality assurance activities to be performed, inspection and testing procedures, training procedures and documentation instructions.  \r\n\r\nStandard operating procedures have been written and made available to all employees in the refrigeration department.  The development and use of SOPs are an integral part of American Freeze Dry's ability to maintain the quality control and quality assurance processes and ensure compliance with governmental regulations.\r\n\r\nEmployees are trained to follow an emergency response plan that moves all employees to an assembly area away from the facility in case of a release of ammonia.  The employees are not trained to respond to releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Whatcom County Fire Department has a HAZMAT team that will respond and take control of the situation should a release occur.  American Freeze Dry has provided the fire department with a copy of their Emergency Response Plan and will conduct a walk-through inspection of the plant annually."

      "SummaryText": "American Freeze Dry is a berry processing, freezing and freeze dry facility located in the City of Ferndale, Whatcom County, in Washington state. The plant was constructed in late 2015 and received the initial charge of 11,800 lbs of anhydrous ammonia in their refrigeration system on January 14, 2016.  The facility was constructed following all local and federal building codes, EPA regulations 40CFRPart68, OSHA requirements 29CFR1910.119, ASME vessel codes, ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 15-2013 and IIAR recommendations. The system consists of one engine room containing the vessels and process equipment.\r\n\r\nThe largest vessel in the system, the high pressure receiver, is 6' x 23', with capacity of 19,476 lbs of ammonia.  Following standard operating procedures this vessel will never be filled to over 80% full, 15,580 lbs.  The ammonia is continually circulating through the closed system, and never held in any one vessel.  Currently the system has 11,800 lbs of ammonia.  The RMP*eSubmit software would not accept modeling for the Worst Case or Alternate Case Scenarios with more ammonia than the existing level.  However, the findings were all calculated using 19,476 lbs of ammonia in the largest vessel as per EPA regulations.  \r\n\r\nEach pressure vessel in the mechanical refrigeration process has a safety relief valve attached.  The outlet is piped to an area away from personnel (the roof).  All vessels are fitted with three-way shut off valves and dual SRVs.  SRVs are inspected and documented every six months, and replaced every five years.  The chances for a leak occurring are reduced because of the following safety systems:\r\n   Suction trap hi-level float\r\n   High discharge pressure shut down\r\n   Low suction pressure shut down\r\n   High discharge temperature shut down\r\n   Oil pressure failure shut down\r\n   High amperes shut down\r\n   Computer auto timer to prevent short cycling\r\n   Oil filters plugged shut down\r\n   250 psi relief valves on high pressure side\r\n   150 psi relief va"
