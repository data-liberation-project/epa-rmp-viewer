All refinery process units are currently managed\n\nunder the PSM Standard, therefore, these processes are, in effect, being managed as RMP Program\n\nLevel 3 processes.  The refinery had a thoroughly-trained, experienced, safety-motivated workforce\n\nthat has achieved an outstanding safety record.  The refinery is in full compliance with the\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM)\n\nstandard.\n\n\n\nPremcor has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is\n\ndemonstrated by the time, money, and effort invested in training personnel and promoting safety in\n\nthe design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement\n\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Safety tools include\n\nengineering controls, real time process monitoring, level, pressure, and temperature alarms, leak\n\ndetection systems, and automatic and manual mitigation systems.  If a release does occur, our trained\n\npersonnel with respond quickly and effectively to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nTo comply with the RMP standard we have focused upon the following:\n\n\n\nMaintaining the management system established by PSM\n\nAdapting the PSM management system to address RMP\n\nPerforming the hazard assessments\n\nCompiling the data elements\n\nCommunicating with the public concerning RMP issues\n\n\n\nPublic Communication of RMP \n\n\n\nPremcor (Williams Refining at the time) assumed a leadership  role in organizing a community wide-\n\nRMP Symposium that took plac"

However, refinery employees are required to enter into a confidentiality\n\nagreement as a condition of employment to protect trade secrets or other proprietary information. \n\nThe confidentiality agreement may also be required of contractors or contract employees, if\n\nnecessary.  The Safety  Department observes this policy in its development and administration of the\n\nPSM program.\n\n\n\nRecommendation Tracking\n\n\n\nThe Memphis Refinery has developed a tracking system to manage recommendations, MOC items,\n\nand other safety concerns arising as a result of PSM-related activities.  When a review team member\n\nmakes a recommendation, it is recorded in the review documentation, and responsibility for\n\nevaluation and action is assigned.  The recommendation is entered into the appropriate section of the\n\nPSM database.  The team assigns a target date for resolution.  The responsible individual then\n\ndecides whether the recommendation is valid and requires action, or if no action is necessary.  Safety \n\nDepartment personnel administer the tracking system, periodically review the status of a\n\nrecommendation or MOC by performing a search in the PSM database, and provided a report of that\n\nstatus to the leadership team.  All aspects of recommendation tracking, from generation to resolution,\n\nare available for review by any employee in the PSM database.  The database record may be searched\n\naccording to:\n\n\n\n* Source of the recommendation               * Unit or location\n\n* Target date                           * Completion date\n\n* Status                           * Priority\n\n* Individual or departmental responsibility\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at Premcor involve hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. \n\nThe accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Premcor.

Refinery operations are always conducted to minimize the\n\nchance of encountering emergencies.  When prevention fails, however, preparedness is the key to\n\neffective emergency response.  The Memphis Refinery maintains written emergency response plan\n\nto protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures and\n\nguidelines for responding to various emergencies including release of a hazardous substance, fire or\n\nexplosion.  The emergency response program addresses the following:\n\n\n\n* Implementation of the Incident Command System (ICS)\n\n* Scope of incident - Level I vs. Level II\n\n* Level I incidents managed/controlled by the Area or Shift Supervisor. \n\n* Level II incidents managed/controlled by the refinery G"
