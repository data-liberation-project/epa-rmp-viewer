The\r\nrefinery has 24-hour communications ability to notify appropriate emergency response organization\r\nin the event of an emergency.   Any public notifications will be coordinated through the Memphis-\r\nShelby County Emergency Management Agency.   \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPremcor is committed to a high level of corporate citizenship, placing the highest priority on the\r\nsafety of persons both within the refinery, and in the neighboring community.  The Memphis\r\nRefinery strives to continually improve the safety program, and to reward employees for outstanding\r\nsafety performance.  To further emphasize safety awareness, the refinery has instituted a generous\r\nsafety bonus incentive program for all refinery employees.\r\n\r\nNotes on RMP Information\r\n\r\nMaximum inventories of RMP flammables in process units were estimated using a conservative\r\ntechnique that yields overstated process inventories.   \r\n\r\nThe largest inventory of hydrogen sulfide in the refinery is found in the SRU, which was investigated\r\nto determine if a threshold quantity of hydrogen sulfide was present.  We determined that no\r\nthreshold quantity of hydrogen sulfide was present in the SRU or elsewhere in the refinery.\r\n\r\nNote:   April 2004 Cat Gasoline Hydrotreater Unit 15 (Cat Gas) Startup Submission\r\n\r\nRMP regulations requires than an RMP update be submitted on or before the startup date of a new\r\nprocess.  Therefore, all data concerning the Cat Gas in the April 2004 RMP submission was gathered\r\nprior to the Cat Gas startup.  Because the unit has not yet been operated, some of the projected Cat\r\nGas operating data may prove to be inaccurate.  Premcor will submit a corrected RMP if actual\r\noperating data varies significantly from the projections contained in the pre-startup submission."

However, refinery employees are required to enter into a confidentiality\r\nagreement as a condition of employment to protect trade secrets or other proprietary information. \r\nThe confidentiality agreement may also be required of contractors or contract employees, if\r\nnecessary.  The Safety  Department observes this policy in its development and administration of the\r\nPSM program.\r\n\r\nRecommendation Tracking\r\n\r\nThe Memphis Refinery has developed a tracking system to manage recommendations, MOC items,\r\nand other safety concerns arising as a result of PSM-related activities.  When a review team member\r\nmakes a recommendation, it is recorded in the review documentation, and responsibility for\r\nevaluation and action is assigned.  The recommendation is entered into the appropriate section of the\r\nPSM database.  The team assigns a target date for resolution.  The responsible individual then\r\ndecides whether the recommendation is valid and requires action, or if no action is necessary.  Safety \r\nDepartment personnel administer the tracking system, periodically review the status of a\r\nrecommendation or MOC by performing a search in the PSM database, and provided a report of that\r\nstatus to the leadership team.  All aspects of recommendation tracking, from generation to resolution,\r\nare available for review by any employee in the PSM database.  The database record may be searched\r\naccording to:\r\n\r\n* Source of the recommendation               * Unit or location\r\n* Target date                           * Completion date\r\n* Status                           * Priority\r\n* Individual or departmental responsibility\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at Premcor involve hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. \r\nThe accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Premcor.

The plan consists of procedures and\r\nguidelines for responding to various emergencies including release of a hazardous substance, fire or\r\nexplosion.  The emergency response program addresses the following:\r\n\r\n* Implementation of the Incident Command System (ICS)\r\n* Scope of incident - Level I vs. Level II\r\n* Level I incidents managed/controlled by the Area or Shift Supervisor. \r\n* Level II incidents managed/controlled by the refinery G"
