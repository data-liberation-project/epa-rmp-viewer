(?GE Plastics?) has a long-standing history of commitment and performance of safe operations, while providing economic stability to the region as Posey County's largest employer. To that end, we have developed an extensive program to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community. We operate under Process Safety Management guidelines, a rigorous set of standards that govern our daily control methods and behaviors.\n\nThese guidelines have been adopted to satisfy the stated policy of GE Plastics to safely manage our site operations. But more than just policy drives us to put safety ahead of all other factors, including financial issues. We pledge to take care of the people who work here and the community around us because they include our family, friends and neighbors.  In short, this region is our home. \n\nWe recognize that to do otherwise would weaken the economic foundation on which our community is built. The Mt. Vernon, IN site has been the backbone of the global GE Plastics business for  more than 40 years and the people working on the site are committed to building upon that positive legacy for decades to come.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan contained in this report is a continuation of that effort, ensuring that there is a solid integration of our site emergency response resources with those available in the community, and that effective communication channels are in place.\n\nOur intensive series of internal reviews and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) external audit process have validated the strengths of the programs we have in place. We have been recognized by OSHA, under the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as being among the best in the nation for worker safety.  We have been designated a STAR site, the highest recognition OSHA gives.\n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understan"

If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company, please contact our Community Relations Representative at (812) 831-7621.  \n\n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nGE Plastics is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities. Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority everywhere we do business.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \n\nTo provide top-quality products for our customers, the manufacturing process at the Mt. Vernon facility uses some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable. While we are committed to 100 percent compliance with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards, as well as systematic assessments used to manage and maintain safe operations with these materials, we routinely go far beyond the regulatory requirements.  Our operating practices and procedures, along with our automated control systems, ensure all steps are taken to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a major release, our trained on-site emergency response organization would be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade, medical and chemical emergency response teams staffed with GE personnel who have collectively committed thousands of hours to training. Many of these individuals are so committed to emergency response that they serve on their community fire and emergency response departments as well. As a result, they devote much of their personal time to additional drills, training and community response.\n\nEffective maintenance and implementation of such a contingency plan relies on strong cooperation with the community's emergency response teams. We consistently network with other emergency response providers in our county, as "

Vernon plant is the largest fully integrated polycarbonate facility in the world, sitting on a 1000+-acre tract along the Ohio River, about two miles south of the city of Mt. Vernon, Indiana.  It was built in 1960 and currently employs about 1,300 people in the Southern Indiana area.  GE Plastics manufactures engineered plastics, marketed under trade names such as LEXAN, ULTEM, VALOX, and others.  Our products are used in a vast array of applications, including the automotive, medical, electronic, construction, computer, and appliance industries. \n\nUnlike most plastics manufacturing locations, the Mt. Vernon site houses four separate businesses, plus support services and research. The site is the headquarters to three of the GE Advanced Materials-Americas businesses, as well as the Mt. Vernon Technology Department, where more than 80 top scientists and engineers work on the cutting edge of plastics innovation, developing materials and applications for new products and plastics manufacturing processes. \n\nBoth workplace safety and environmental protection are part of the culture at the GE Plastics facility, with more than $500 million being invested in the site since 1991 for expansion, capital improvement, safety and environmental protection. These improvements have lead to recognition by the states of Indiana and Kentucky. Most recently, in 2004 the Chlorine Institute recognized the site?s Brine Recovery Unit for zero reportable chlorine releases and zero OSHA recordable injuries for"

These are: Mono-methylamine (MMA), a regulated flammable substance; Phosgene, a regulated toxic substance; Chlorine, a regulated toxic substance; Nitric acid, a regulated toxic substance; and Ammonia, a regulated toxic substance.\n\nPhosgene, chlorine, mono-methylamine, and nitric acid are raw materials used to manufacture our products.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our manufacturing process.   \n\n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nGE Plastics complies with a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (or PSM). The programs ensure that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained. The programs satisfy the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features in place to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\nREGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n\n?Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error, which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\n?Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks to contain a spill;\n\n?Routine pipe and vessel inspection and testing;\n\n?Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions;\n\n?Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistent safe work-practices;\n\n?Maintenance programs to ensure ongoing equipment reliability - including equipment testing and inspection;\n\n?A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards - this is called \"Management of Change\"; \n\n?Safety pre-qualification for all contractors;\n\n?Safety reviews prior to startup of our processes; and,\n\n?Safety permitting procedures tha"

Following this incident, GEAM increased the level of safety instrumented control automation, redesigned the condenser, and implemented revised shutdown/start-up procedures to prevent future occurrences.  \n\nOn May 8, 2004, there was a release of chlorine vapor at the Brine plant totaling 5 pounds due to the rupture of a chlorine diaphragm cell in the chlorine manufacturing process. There was no off-site impact and no one was injured.  There was on-site property damage.  Following this incident, GEAM increased the level of safety warning automation and implemented revised operating procedures and training to prevent future occurrences.
