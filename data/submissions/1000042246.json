Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Dominguez Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing of sulfuric acid and the regeneration of spent sulfuric acid.  We have one regulated substance that could be present at our facility above threshold levels; Sulfur dioxide. The sulfur dioxide is dissolved in a heavy sulfuric acid received at the plant for processing. when in solution in the acid, it is not anhydrous.\n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Solvay Dominguez Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Solvay Dominguez Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are LOPA, Checklist, HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Solvay Dominguez Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Solvay Dominguez Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Solvay Dominguez Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  This is tracked through an electronic work order system.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Solvay Dominguez Facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSolvay Dominguez Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSolvay Dominguez Facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSolvay Dominguez Facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Solvay Dominguez Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards relate"

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Dominguez Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Because the Plant does not handle anhydrous sulfur dioxide, there has been no accidental release during this period that meets the definition; however Solvay has chosen to report an incident that occurred November 2013.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Solvay Dominguez Plant has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn order to encourage continuous improvement in all elements of Process Safety the facility regularly reports progress of improvement efforts that are described in the Process Safety Management Plan.  Many of these improvements are results of audits and other reviews such as Management of Change, Process Hazard Analysis, Accident Investigations and others.\n\n"
