The Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique is the type of PHA utilized at LAR to ensure that a systematic study of each process is carried out. The HAZOP analysis is recognized by experts as a very comprehensive hazard evaluation technique. The typical HAZOP team includes a facilitator, knowledgeable operator and unit engineer who systematically analyze detailed  process drawings to identify potential hazards. These potential hazards are assigned a risk rank according to specified criteria. The team evaluates accident prevention and mitigation measures already in place and makes recommendations if additional measures are necessary. Other technical experts are consulted as needed.\n\n\n\nFindings of the team are documented and reviewed by Management for resolution.

      "SummaryText": "ars there was one reportable RMP incident that occurred. A flammable mixture resulted in an on-site, localized asset damage incident with no off-site consequences.  Incidents and near misses that involve Environment, Health and Safety releases have been carefully investigated and evaluated to prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the process and the environment. The program  consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after  an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, the public, and post  incident cleanup and decontamination procedures. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated based on modifications to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program is reviewed on an annual basis. Affected personnel are informed of and/or trained on any changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Los Angeles Refinery is coordinated with several agencies. This includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials including the Fire Department and Law Enforcement. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, as well as facilitating appropriate response to an incident.   \n\n\n\nThe Los Angel"

      "SummaryText": "es Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local emergency response organizations and provide information to local emergency responders regarding hazards and locations of regulated substances in the refinery. The refinery is also a charter member of the Southern California Industrial Mutual Aid Organization.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSafety enhancing projects underway at LAR include structural fireproofing upgrades and deluge systems upgrades. Facility siting studies have also been revalidated with an emphasis on ensuring the safety of non-essential personnel during non-routine operations such as start-ups and shutdowns. Also seismic reviews of the facility have been conducted to ensure safety during a seismic event to meet the Local Emergency Planning Committee Seismic Guidance approved in 2014.  \n\n\n\nSafety is a core value at Phillips 66 and LAR. The LAR safety program includes various elements aimed at continuous improvement, including annual computer-based safety training for all employees,  annual refresher training classes, safety meetings conducted at least monthly, employee required safety observations, and safety bulletins to alert personnel when a safety concern is noted. Continuous improvement is also an operational goal. Recommendations from  process hazard analyses, audits, incident investigations and employee input provide opportunities to enhance the safety of the refinery.\n\n\n\nLAR has submitted an extensive application to CalOSHA to approve the plant as a Voluntary Participation Program (VPP) site and is in the second year of implementing Refinery Safety regulations issued October 2017 for California refineries.
