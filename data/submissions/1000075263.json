LAR has a written employee participation policy that outlines the many ways in which employees are involved in the accident prevention program, and employees have access to all information generated within the program. \n\n\n\nAll Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)teams include an experienced unit operator and unit engineer. Employees are also members of teams formed for compliance audits,incident investigations, reviewing MOCs and pre-startup safety reviews. The plant emergency response team is comprised of qualified employees who receive specialized training and participate in emergency drills. Employees are expected to report incidents and near miss situations that may occur, as well as any safety concerns, safety hazards and suggestions they may have. \n\n\n\nEmployee assistance is enlisted to develop training programs and operating procedures and compile other critical process safety information. Additionally, LAR has various safety programs designed to increase plant safety by encouraging employee involvement.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLAR maintains key technical documents that contain information essential to safe operation of the various processes. This information is accessible to employees to facilitate the identification and understanding of hazards posed by chemicals used or produced in the processes and includes chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information.\n\n\n\nSafety Data Sheets (SDS) have been compiled for all chemicals used onsite, whether or not they are deemed hazardous.

The Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique is the type of PHA utilized at LAR to ensure that a systematic study of each process is carried out. The HAZOP analysis is recognized by experts as a very comprehensive hazard evaluation technique. The typical HAZOP team includes a facilitator, knowledgeable operator and unit engineer who systematically analyze detailed  process drawings to identify potential hazards. These potential hazards are assigned a risk rank according to specified criteria. The team evaluates accident prevention and mitigation measures already in place and makes recommendations if additional measures are necessary. Other technical experts are consulted as needed.\n\n\n\nFindings of the team are documented and reviewed by Management for resolution.

Again, documented findings are forwarded to management to ensure that critical recommendations are implemented.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nLAR has set forth detailed written procedures with step-by-step instructions for the various modes of process operations, including startup, normal and temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown, and normal shutdown to prevent the release of regulated substances. These procedures are accessible to employees for reference and training and kept current by revisions implemented through the management of change process, periodic review, and annual accuracy certification.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nAll employees of LAR that are involved in operating a process are trained in the process and its operating procedures. This training emphasizes safety and health hazard issues, emergency operations,and safe work practices. Refresher training is provided at least every three years to maintain a clear understanding of current operations and any process modifications that may have occurred. Employee comprehension of training is verified, and documentation is maintained. Additionally, operating employees receive required safety training annually.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nContractors are utilized at LAR to supplement employees when increased or specialized activities are conducted.

All changes are reviewed and approved by knowledgeable personnel from various disciplines to ensure that potential new hazards are managed and any controls in place are not adversely affected. Affected employees and other workers receive training on the change prior to its implementation. In addition, process safety information and operating procedures are revised to reflect any changes.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nShould an incident occur that results in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of regulated substances, LAR promptly begins a thorough investigation.
