INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan as it pertains to Cordova - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health, and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 80 percent, and releases to water 75 percent. \n\n\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cordova Fire Department and/or other emergency response organizations arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \n \n\n3.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE and THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nWe use one regulated substance at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance. \n\nThe following regulated substance is used at Cordova - 3M Company:\n               -Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), a non-flammable corrosive acid, which is a key raw material used to make such products as replacements for"

WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO and ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\nEPA has directed all affected facilities to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at the facility, as unlikely as that might be, and an alternative, more realistic, accident scenario.   \n\nTo evaluate our worst-case scenario we used look-up tables and equations provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The look-up tables indicate the worst case scenario from Cordova - 3M Company is a release of hydrogen fluoride in a gaseous form over a ten minute period.\n\nTo evaluate our alternative case scenario Cordova - 3M Company used an air-modeling program called Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA).  The alternative release scenario for hydrogen fluoride is a release for 10 minutes in a gaseous form from a reactor.\n\n\n5. PROGRAM TO  PREVENT ACCIDENTAL RELEASES\n\nAt Cordova - 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nWe have programs in place to address accidental releases as required by EPA, Process Safety Management requirements from OSHA, and all notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right To Know regulations.\n\nSome of the process controls we have at Cordova - 3M Company are; vents, relief and check valves, scrubbers, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, emergency power, grounding equipment, rupture disks, purge systems, recycled cooling water, refrigeration and, building air pressure to act as secondary containment.
