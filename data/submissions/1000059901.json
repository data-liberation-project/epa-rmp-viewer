If an answering machine picks up the call, the emergency message will be left on the machine.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending and propane storage systems, including the associated piping, three storage vessels and butane/propane rail cars. To date, the facility has not had an accident involving butane or propane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Fire Department and Dane County Emergency Management. \r\n\r\nEfforts to improve system safety include tying in the compressor shutoff to the high level alarms in the storage vessels and replacing all cable actuated Emergency Shutoff Valves with nitrogen driven pneumatic actuators. In the event of equipment malfunction resultiung in a release, a facility Emergency Shutdown (ESD) can be activated from a remote location at the facility closing vessel internal and truck bulkhead valves stopping the release rather than relying on human element to shut the valve that is cable driven."
