      "SummaryText": "\n\nDescription:   \nSunmet, Inc. was incorporated in December 1997. We grow, pack, ship and sell tree fruit (peaches, plums and nectarines), apples, as well as grapes. \n\nRegulated Substance: \nThe only toxic substance we handle above the federal threshold levels is Anhydrous Ammonia.  We use anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to keep our product cold after harvest.  Since the product we handle is considered \"perishable\" the refrigeration helps to prolong its shelf life.  \n\n\nSafety Features:  \nIn order to maintain the highest level of safety with our refrigeration systems we utilize only certified, licensed companies and contractors in the design, installation and maintenance of our systems.  There are multiple safety features built into the system to keep risks at a minimum.  \n\n\nAccident History:  \nThere have been no reported accidents related to anhydrous ammonia reported in the last 5- years.\n \n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\nWhen utilizing the EPA provided RMP COMP modeling software for the worst case scenario, the distance calculated to the toxic endpoint was 1.2 miles.  \n\n\nAlternative-Case Scenario:\nThe EPA modeling software for the alternative-case scenario calculated the distance to toxic endpoint at 0.2 miles.  \n\n\nEmergency Response:\nThe City of  Selma Fire Department would be the First Responders for an emergency response for this facility. We have recently completed a walk-through inspection of  this plant with the fire department.  \n\n\nPlanned changes:  \nWe plan to have follow up training with our anhydrous ammonia supplier concerning safety hazards, handling procedures,  maintenance procedures, etc.  We also plan to update our forklift operating training, lockout/tagout, etc.   We utilize the IIAR Bulletin 109 Checklist for Ammonia Refrigeration Systems to complete routine inspections of our plant."
