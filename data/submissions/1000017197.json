      "SummaryText": "1. Source and Facility Description\n\nThe Visual Pak secondary packaging facility located at 1909 Waukegan Road in Waukegan, Illinois, is subject to the USEPA RMP rule because it contains a mixture of propane (CAS number 74-98-6), n-butane (CAS Number 106-97-8), isobutane (CAS Number 75-28-5), and isopentane (CAS Number 78-78-4) exceeding 10,000 pounds.  The mixture is used as a propellant for aerosol products.\n\nConsumer products are transferred to the facility for secondary packaging or various repackaging alternatives.  All storage and handling of aerosol cans takes place inside the facility and there is no outside storage or handling.  The facility walls are constructed of pre-cast concrete. \n \nProducts are stored in the receiving portions of the facility prior to repackaging.  Repackaging is performed in the production and staging areas in the center of the facility.  Finished goods are stored in the shipping area.    \nFor the most part, the turnaround time for goods in the receiving area is approximately three weeks, while the finished goods have a residence time of approximately one week.  Mixtures of propellant, liquids and solids are stored in cans ranging in  from 2.75 to 25 ounces.  Approximately 3.25 million cans, or 5,000,000 pounds of propellant, may be stored in the well-protected facility at any one time.\n\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas.  The propellant is not inherently toxic.\n\n2. Potential Release Scenarios\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirement, a worst-case release from the container with the highest amount of regulated flammable substances was analyzed to assess the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint.  This facility only stores and repackages aerosol cans of finished goods.  There is no associated process piping or vessels; therefore, the worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios would be the same.  The release scenarios analyzed and the endpoints evaluated are based on the guidance contained in the USEPA's"

      "SummaryText": "Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG), dated March 2009.\n\n3. Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant at the Visual Pak Waukegan warehouse in the last 5 years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site; or off- site death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nAlthough a formal, documented prevention program is not required by the RMP rule for Program 1 processes, a number of design and operational controls are in place to reduce the likelihood or decrease the severity of a fire or explosion.  The most significant controls are discussed below.\n  - The facility is fully protected by an ESFR (early suppression fast response) sprinkler system.\n  - Enclosed heat tunnels are used on production lines to package the goods in cellophane, which will help to    \n    contain a potential explosion of an aerosol can.\n  - Level 3 aerosol products are stored inside a fenced area and are only taken outside of this area to be     \n    repackaged or shipped.  After repackaging, they are immediately returned to the fenced area.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Visual Pak Waukegan facility has developed and implemented a Crisis Management Guide to address the possibility of a significant natural or man-made disaster crisis that could affect the safety of Visual Pak employees and/or have an adverse impact on the environment, the community or critical business operations.  The facility's Emergency Response Program includes specific procedures for responding to potential emergencies / situations, including: fire, spill, tornado, terrorism, etc."
