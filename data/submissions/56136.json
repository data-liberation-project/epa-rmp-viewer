There are two ammonia sensors located in the New Engine Room that alert facility personnel and activate the ventilation system in the New Mechanical Room.\n \nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 11,511 pounds.  \n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and the condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for the Dock area, Refrigerated Storage Room, -20 F Freezer Room, +40 F Cooler Room, +20 F Cooler Room, and Spiral Freezers.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the Old Engine Room and the New Engine Room. Evaporators are located in the Dock Area, Refrigerated Storage Room, -20 F Freezer Room, +40 F Cooler Room, and +20 F Cooler Room.  Spiral Freezers are located in the Ambient Warehouse area.  The condensers are mounted on the Engine Room roof. \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Austin Packaging Company ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  In-house maintenance personnel conduct on-going inspections and preventative maintenance on the system.  Any major repairs are contracted to a professional service firm.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut down, condenser fans and water pumps shut down, evaporator fans shut down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases. \n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system.  In the event of over pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves to the atmosp"

This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted during inspections and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, Austin Packaging Company has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (January 2005 \u00bf January 2010) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \u00bfnear misses\u00bf that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAustin Packaging Company has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Austin Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9 1 1 to alert the local Police and Fire Department.  Other responders will be called as needed.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, calls will be made to the following organizations:  the National Response Center and within 15 minutes, the Minnesota Dep"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nAustin Packaging Company has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Austin Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia related emergency, it is the policy of Austin Packaging Company to evacuate the employees and to allow the responders to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAustin Packaging Company began operations on the ammonia refrigeration system in 1997.  In 2005, the system was expanded to include an additional condenser, spiral freezer, and evaporators.  Another expansion is currently in process, which includes the installation of a new recirculator, compressor, heat exchanger, and spiral freezer evaporators.  The facility also plans to exceed the 10,000-pound threshold as part of this expansion.  System startup of the new equipment is scheduled to occur in mid to late January 2010.  The ammonia system at the Austin Packaging Company consists primarily of vessels, compressors, condensers, evaporators/spiral freezers and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the Old Engine Room and the New Engine Room. The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.

The facility holds evacuation drills at least once per year.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on January 6-7, 2010.  This document includes the results from the two elements: 1) the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and 2) a Site Inspection. This study was performed to define potential hazards associated with operational deviations of the ammonia system.  As a result of the Process Hazard Analysis, a number of recommendations were made, such as procedural changes, ammonia awareness training and some equipment upgrades."
