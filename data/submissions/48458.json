We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\n\n\nThe Mankato Terminal has three pipelines that are routed through the facility and are regulated by the Department of Transportation.  These three pipelines are in part, a mix product line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), a dedicated propane line and a dedicated anhydrous ammonia line which is owned by Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P. (Magellan) and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P.  In addition, the facility receives propane from the pipeline to four 90,000 gallon capacity storage tanks.  These tanks are used for distribution to the truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.\n\n\n\nThe Magellan ammonia system receives ammonia product off of the ammonia pipeline and is thus routed to their three tanks which are two 90,000 gallon tanks and a single 63,000 gallon tank.  In addition to the same ammonia system, a portion of the ammonia product can be routed to a cold storage tank which is owned and operated by Koch Nitrogen Company (Koch) with limited operations by Enterprise.  Koch is accountable to file their own RMP for their assets and therefore is only mentioned for the purpose of the facility description.\n\n\n\nAll of the previously mentioned tanks (propane and ammonia) are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed a maximum capacity of 80%.\n\n\n\nIn our facility we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported and stored at the facility via a dedicated anhydrous ammonia pipeline.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nThis simulation involves a complete failure of two of the three anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  The scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) ? Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the transfer loading hose on the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 2,500 pounds per minutes for 10 minutes after the hose break.
