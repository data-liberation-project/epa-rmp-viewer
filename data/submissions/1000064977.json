The Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Information Management Plan (WIMS), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is site-specific. It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the ERP and drills are conducted annually.\n\n\n\nWilliams CEO, Alan Armstrong, has supported the commitment to safety in saying, \"While each [of Williams Core Values & Beliefs] are important, our commitment to Safety and Environmental Stewardship is critical, reminding us that Williams is committed to the health and safety of our work force and to the protection of our neighbors, the environment, and our assets.\"\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Gas Conditioning Plant is a natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction facility that processes raw natural gas into pipeline quality natural gas and NGL. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The PCGP is designed to process 700 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the PCGP is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas to produce a residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid.  To complete this separation, the inlet field gas is chilled using a propane refrigeration system. This process causes the NGL to condense out of the chilled gas stream. As the gas is chilled, ethylene glycol is injected into the filed gas to absorb water. Ethy"

The remaining gaseous stream is sold as methane residue gas product and leaves the facility via pipeline. The ethylene glycol is regenerated and reused within the process. The NGLs are delivered by both pipelines and to a truck loading site. The NGL stream is stored onsite in pressurized storage tanks prior to being trucked offsite for sale.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Information Management Plan (WIMS), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. Key elements of these programs include:\n\n\n\n?Process Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.\n\n\n\n?Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\n?Operating Procedures: The Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.\n\n\n\n?Contractors: Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understa"

The program includes OTJ training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\n\n\n?Management of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\n\n\n?Incident Investigation: The goal of each investigation is to determine that facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n\n\n\n?Compliance audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP/PSM/WIMS procedures and regulations.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The Parachute Creek Gas Plant has not had a release of a regulated substance in the last five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant is coordinated with Garfield County LEPC. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Garfield County LEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Garfield County LEPC and emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Parachute Creek Plant plans to evaluate additional engineering safeguards and continue training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."
