The Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant has also implemented all the elements of Williams Information Management Plan (WIMS), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.\r\n\r\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is site-specific. It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the ERP and drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nWilliams CEO, Alan Armstrong, has supported the commitment to safety in saying, While each [of Williams Core Values & Beliefs] are important, our commitment to Safety and Environmental Stewardship is critical, reminding us that Williams is committed to the health and safety of our work force and to the protection of our neighbors, the environment, and our assets.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe Parachute Gas Conditioning Plant is a natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction facility that processes raw natural gas into pipeline quality natural gas and NGL. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The PCGP is designed to process 700 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the PCGP is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas to produce a residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid.  To complete this separation, the inlet field gas is chilled using a propane refrigeration system. This process causes the NGL to condense out of the chilled gas stream. As the gas is chilled, ethylene glycol is injected into the filed gas to absorb water. Ethy"

      "SummaryText": "The Parachute Creek Gas Plant has not had a release of a regulated substance in the last five years. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant is coordinated with Garfield County LEPC. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Garfield County LEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Garfield County LEPC and emergency response organizations. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Parachute Creek Plant plans to evaluate additional engineering safeguards and continue training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."
