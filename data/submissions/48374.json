To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" has been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.  Emergency response procedures are contained in the Emergency Action Plan maintained by the facility.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil.  A gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in two 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks operating at approximately 200 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  A 210 barrel atmospheric storage tank is available for any condensate that might be produced in the separation process.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.\n\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss both NGL and condensate which are the specific chemicals contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.   \n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of the RMP, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response p"
