      "SummaryText": "-Introduction to Risk Management Program-\r\n\r\nA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been developed for the Butterball, Mt. Olive facility. The Risk Management Plan for the Butterball, Mt. Olive facility has been prepared for the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia in the facility's refrigeration system. Each part of the RMP is submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency, meeting or exceeding the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. \r\n\r\nThe submission is due to the need to fulfill the requirements mandated by the EPA for a new submission or an update to occur every 5 years. The RMP was resubmitted in accordance with the 5-year update requirement. The RMP resubmission was completed on 10/5/2021.\r\n\r\n-Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response or Emergency Action Policies-\r\n\r\nThe Butterball, Mt. Olive facility recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment, and property. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The controls of accidents have been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Butterball, Mt. Olive facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established an Emergency Response Plan. The objectives of the Emergency Response Plan are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response or action programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation. Ed Spafford, the Utilities Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and e"

      "SummaryText": "mergency response or emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and are improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n-Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled-\r\n\r\nThe Butterball, Mt. Olive facility includes two (2) ammonia refrigeration systems (Refrigeration System 1 and Refrigeration System 2) to provide process cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) contained in each of the systems is in excess of 10,000 pounds. The maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in Refrigeration System 1 is 117,140 lbs. of ammonia, the maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in Refrigeration System 2 is 40,900 lbs. EPA instructs to round these numbers to two significant digits and as such they will be reported at 120,000 lbs. and 41,000 lbs. respectively. Since an ammonia release from the systems could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulated, the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\r\n\r\n-The Prevention Program-\r\n\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses on efforts at the Butterball, Mt. Olive facility to contain the refrigerant inside the systems. The goal is to reduce the risk of injury and promote safer practices at the Butterball, Mt. Olive facility. The following items are included in the Prevention Program in relatio"

Each element is reviewed and updated with frequencies in accordance with regulations on the EPA and OSHA standards.\r\n\r\n-Five-Year Accident History-\r\n\r\nNo reportable accidents have occurred at the Butterball, Mt. Olive facility in the last 5 years. A sample accident report can be found in the Process Safety Management Files. \r\n\r\n-Emergency Response Program-\r\n\r\nThe Butterball, Mt. Olive facility's Emergency Response Plan includes a Level A Qualified HAZMAT Team. The HAZMAT Team will respond to all emergencies, including fire, but will call the Fire Department if the fire were to become large or difficult to handle.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan is kept with the Process Safety Management Files. \r\n\r\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety-\r\n\r\nThe facility has begun the following plans to improve safety. These items will be assigned responsible parties, tracked, and implemented, or closed out with proper justification, to ensure the facility's ammonia refrigeration systems continue to operate safely.\r\n\r\n1.\tPlanned installation of Stainless Steel Condensers and Penthouse Evaporators to reduce the risk of corrosion and deterioration.\r\n2.\tConduct weekly PSM / Safety meetings\r\n3.\tAnnual refresher on PSM Elements and Operating Procedures\r\n4.\t3-Year Refresher Training"
