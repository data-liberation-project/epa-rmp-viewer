The Safety Manager along with the Regional Safety Director are responsible for enforcing the safety policies and procedures at the facility, which include the risk prevention programs as specified by Process Safety Management and the Risk Management Program.  Other safety programs include forklift safety, hazard communication, lockout / tagout, Hazardous Materials Business Plan, emergency evacuation plan, employee safety manuals, as well as the Risk Management Plan on file with the Fremont Fire Department.\n\nSysco Food Services of San Francisco has an emergency plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1. To save lives.\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3. To protect the environment.\n4. To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed to ensure it is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Sysco Food Services of San Francisco ammonia refrigeration system was built in 1991 with a major expansion occurring in 1998.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 5900 Stewart Avenue, Fremont, California 94538.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 10,500 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, cold storage, and freezer storage.  Refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  \n\nThe refrigeration syste"

The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR), where the pressure is reduced from 181 psig to 75 psig.  The CPR serves as the main storage vessel for the system.  It also supplies liquid ammonia to the cooler (16) and dock (5) evaporators and the High Temperature Suction Accumulator, which maintains a liquid/vapor mixture of ammonia at 28 psig.  As the liquid ammonia enters the various evaporator coils, it expands reducing the temperature.  These evaporators are used to maintain low air temperatures for the cooler and dock areas.  As the air is chilled by the cooler/dock evaporators, the ammonia is partially vaporized and returned to the High Temperature Suction Accumulator.\n\nThe High Temperature Suction Accumulator provides liquid ammonia for supply to the freezer evaporators (9), which return two-phased suction to the Low Temperature Suction Accumulator.  The Low Temperature Suction Accumulator further reduces the pressure of the ammonia to 1.3 psig.  The Booster Compressors (2) pull low pressure ammonia vapor from the Low Temperature Suction Accumulator and discharge higher pressure vapor back to the High Temperature Suction Accumulator.  The High Stage Compressors (2) pull the ammonia vapor from the High Temperature Suction Accumulator and compress it, discharging high pressure ammonia vapor (hot gas) to the condenser. Hot gas is also used for defrost in the cooler and freezer evaporators and for pressurizing liquid transfer tanks associated with the accumulator vessels.  At the condenser, the ammonia is condensed to high pressure liquid and recycled to the High Pressure Receiver.  The system also has an emergency dump tank (into which a common relief header vents), which is kept full of water.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMIC"

      "SummaryText": "AL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Sysco Food Services of San Francisco ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and make repairs as necessary.\n\nThe Sysco Food Services of San Francisco facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia leak detectors in the machine room and the cold storage warehouse, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Sysco Food Services of San Francisco has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs which are performed on an as needed basis.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Sysco "

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or A?near missesA? that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSysco Food Services of San Francisco has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local Fremont Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team and/or the refrigeration contractor.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nThe Sysco Food Services of San Francisco facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The VP of Operations or the Safety Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available.  Sysco Food Services of San Francisco maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility including the maintenance manager.

The Compliance Audit (September 2008) and PHA Revalidation (May 2009) generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These include improving the preventive maintenance procedures, revising the Operating Procedures, and verifying the functionality of emergency shut down features of the ammonia system.
