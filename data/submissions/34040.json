As stated on their website, The purpose of the City Utilities Division is to ensure uninterrupted water, sewer, and drainage service to all our customers that meet all regulatory requirements.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Water Treatment Facility located at 350 Avenida Santa Margarita.  Startup of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide systems occurred in 1974.  The facility is located east of the intersection of Avenida Santa Margarita and Calle Bahia, just 0.58 kilometers (0.36miles) west of Interstate 5.  The immediate area is primarily residential areas.\n\nThe chlorine system of the well water at the Water Treatment Facility of City of San Clemente Utilities Division is used to oxidize soluble iron and manganese forming a precipitate for subsequent removal in the pressure filters.  Post chlorination of filtered effluent is for distribution system water quality control.  Chlorine is delivered to the facility in one-ton containers (2) and in 150-pound cylinders (2).  Chlorine gas is drawn from a maximum of two tanks on line through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  Chlorine gas leaving the one-ton container passes through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators control the flow of the chlorine gas to injectors where chlorine combines with water to produce chlorine solution.  At the mixing point of chlorine and water, the solution becomes sufficiently"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine and sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all City of San Clemente Utilities Division employees. Since the City of San Clemente Utilities Division Water Treatment Facility is an unmanned facility,  no evacuation would be required in case of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the City of San Clemente Utilities Division Water Treatment Facility responsible person, Mr. Steve Patterson at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe City of San Clemente Utilities Division has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department,  Orange County Fire Department.  In the case of a chemical-related (chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide) emergency, its is the policy of City of San Clemente Utilities Division to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).  There is a windsock present on the building to ensure that the responder are approaching from the upwind direction.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the City of San Clemente Utilities Division Water Treatment Facility.  The PHA Revalidation was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlo"

The changes are scheduled to be completed by May 2005.\n\nIn addition the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the Water Treatment Facility employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility's safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining Process Safety Management and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

      "SummaryText": "diluted to no longer merit concern.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide system at Water Treatment Facility is used for water treatment to dechlorinate and to control the residual chlorine after chlorination of the well water.  There is typically a one-ton container and a 150-pound cylinder on-line.  The vacuum regulator/heater assembly is placed on the top container valve to ensure that sulfur dioxide gas is pulled from the container.  The flow of the water generates a vacuum and opens the vacuum regulator, drawing sulfur dioxide out of the container or cylinder, which then passes to the rotameters.  The rotameters control the flow of the sulfur dioxide gas to injectors where sulfur dioxide combines with water to produce a solution. \n\nThe chlorine system of the Water Treatment Facility maintains a maximum of 2 one-ton chlorine containers and two 150-pound chlorine cylinders (4,300 lbs) whereas the sulfur dioxide system stores a maximum of 1 one-ton sulfur dioxide containers and two 150-pound sulfur dioxide cylinders (2,300 lbs) in the chemical storage room.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide system at the Water Treatment Facility have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the City of San Clemente Utilities Division treatment processes operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the Water Treatment Facility fail and result in a release of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide, there are three mechanisms in the facility to minimize the impact: 1) ch"

The chlorine/sulfur dioxide sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms are located in the storage room and the injector room.  Once a chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide concentration of 1 ppm is detected by the sensors, the ventilation system that continuously circulates the air in the building will be shut off by the scrubber system.  The scrubber system will then neutralize the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide released in the storage room.  The operator on duty will then be paged.\n\nThe emergency chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubber system at the Water Treatment Facility system uses a horizontal packed bed and exhaust fan design to reduce the concentration of chlorine/sulfur dioxide within the chemical storage room to 0.5 ppm.  As the chlorine/sulfur dioxide laden gases pass through each of the stages, chlorine/sulfur dioxide is absorbed and reacted with caustic solution and chlorine/sulfur dioxide free air is exhausted through the stack. The system is designed with the ventilation rate of 3,000 ACFM air flow rate and the maximum discharge chlorine/sulfur dioxide concentration of 5 ppm.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there has been no reportable releases of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide at the City of San Clemente Utilities Division Water Treatment Facility over the past five years (April 1999 - April 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of San Clemente Utilities Division has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe City of San Clemente Utilities Division maintains"
