Chlorine is stored prior to and during use in 1-ton containers on an unenclosed concrete pad. The chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquefied gas, and is released into water using a pressurized system. The maximum intended chlorine inventory at the facility is 8.000 pounds which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.\n\n2.0    POLICIES\n\nChlorine is a toxic chemical and precautions must be taken in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to facility personnel and to reduce the threat of accidental release, which might result in exposure to the surrounding community and to the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and industry rules, regulations, and guidelines. Chemical safety at the City of Nacogdoches Southside Pump Station is dependent upon strict operating procedures, safe handling methods, and thorough training of employees. Chlorine safety devices are also inherent in the design of the facility and in the equipment used in the chlorine chemical process.\n\n\n3.0    WORST CASE/ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO ANALYSES INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nEPA defines the worst-case scenario as total failure of the largest vessel. The alternative-case scenario is defined as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario. The alternative case scenario should also reach an off-site endpoint, unless no such scenario exists.\n\nAt the City of Nacogdoches SSPS, the worst-case scenario for chlorine would result in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas. The impact radius would be 1.3 miles and affect 4122 persons. Public receptors would include residences, commercial and public recreatio"

The impact radius would be 0.2 miles and affect 0 persons. Public receptors would include residences and public recreation areas or arenas. There were no environmental receptors within the impact radius.\n\n4.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe City of Nacogdoches SSPS complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. The \nfollowing sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nSafety Information\n\nThe City of Nacogdoches SSPS maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the surface water disinfection process.\n\nHazard Review\n\nOur facility conducts detailed studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our chlorine   processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel and are re-validated at least once every five years. Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorine process, the City of Nacogdoches SSPS maintains written operation procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\n\nThe City of Nacogdoches SSPS has a comprehensive training program "

      "SummaryText": "to ensure employees who are operating the chlorine process are competent in the operations procedures associated with the process.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe City of Nacogdoches SSPS conducts regular maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n    \nCompliance Audit\n\nThe City of Nacogdoches SSPS conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe City of Nacogdoches SSPS promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of chlorine. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n    \n5.0    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe City of Nacogdoches SSPS employees will not respond to a chemical emergency at the plant.  As required by 40 CFR Part 68.90, the City of Nacogdoches is included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders "
