Operations at Clinton Labs began in June of 1970.  Clinton Labs is located on a 700-acre site.  The plant itself includes 80 buildings on 140 acres.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Clinton Labs has designed and implemented, including:\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n4. Five-year accident history\n5. The emergency response program\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nClinton Labs is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances. Clinton Labs has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. Clinton Labs? accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.\n\nClinton Laboratories has a Plant Emergency Manual that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected nei"

      "SummaryText": "ghbors.\n\nClinton Labs plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nClinton Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues. Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nClinton Labs is divided into two main functional areas.  Animal Health, on the south end of the plant, manufactures feed additives and other animal health products.  These products are finished and packaged on site for worldwide delivery to customers.  The second functional area, site services, is located primarily in the center of the plant, with other buildings throughout the plant. Services provided include: steam, water, heat transfer media, electricity, and maintenance support. The services area provides support for Animal Health areas.  The facility has a Title V operating permit under the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe following regulated substances are handled at Clinton Labs in quantities above the threshold quantities established under the RMP regulations: \n\nTOXICS:  anhydrous ammonia, chlorine\n\nFLAMMABLES - None\n      \n\n3.

The facility is also subject to regulation by other agencies, including the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \n\nSpecific prevention programs include conducting pre-startup and design hazard assessments, proactive maintenance programs, routine vessel inspections, emergency response training, safe to work programs, employee and contractor safety programs, and accident investigation programs.\n\nAs a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), Lilly participates in a program known as Responsible Care ? . The purpose of Responsible Care ? is to commit companies to performance improvement in health, safety, and environmental quality. The Responsible Care ? initiative is driven by the following guiding principles: \n? respond to community concerns\n? develop chemicals and products that have a safe life cycle\n? make health, safety and environment a priority for new processes\n? report hazards to employees, customers and the public\n? counsel customers on safe use, transportation and disposal of products\n? operate plants in an environmentally safe manner\n? increase knowledge of product and process safety\n? solve historical contamination problems\n? participate in government regulation development\n? promote Responsible Care ? with other chemical companies\n\nIn order to participate in ACC?s Responsible Care ? program, Lilly has committed to meet these guidelines and incorporate them into the way it does business. All Lilly sites regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (Indiana and Puerto Rico sites) participate in this national program. Similar programs have also been initiated in European and Canadian plants. The heart of the Responsible Care ? initiative is the seven Codes of Management Practices:\n\nCOMMUNITY AWARENESS & EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nGoal: Ensure emergency preparedness and fost"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\nClinton Labs keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  In the five-year period from December 2002 to December 2007, Clinton Labs has had no accidents as defined in the 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n5. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AT CLINTON LABORATORIES\nThe Clinton Laboratories Incident Management System is comprehensive.  It includes elements like a site emergency response plan, employee protective actions, the emergency management organization, and implementation of a response, post incident procedures and building specific pre-emergency plans.  The plan is executed through a cooperative effort between the site?s management support team, full time emergency response teams, local law enforcement, and local emergency management. The on site emergency response capabilities include full time emergency response teams (described below), fire and spill response equipment, rescu"

Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.\n\nCOMMUNITY ALERT NETWORK (CAN) SYSTEM\nClinton Laboratories implemented an innovative community emergency notification system in 1996. The Community Alert Network, or CAN, is an automated phone messaging system. A message is delivered to the CAN organization via a 24 hr emergency line.  With the approval of the Vermillion County Sheriff, the message is then broadcasted to every phone number in the Clinton Labs community database.  The CAN system can deliver messages to 15,000 phones per hour.  This system is the quickest way to notify the community of an emergency at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS \nSite emergency response teams undergo regular training by security coordinators and officers. These trainers attend and receive certification from the best emergency response schools in the country. In an emergency situation, a member of the plant security staff becomes the incident commander. The Incident Commander directs all field response activities and makes regular reports to the management support team as the incident proceeds.  The Incident Commander and Incident Team Leaders direct the specific tactical actions of the emergency response teams, described below.  Approximately 80 employees, who hold full time jobs elsewhere on the site, make up the various emergency response teams.  Several of the employees are cross-trained on more than one team.  A brief description of the teams follows.\n\n? FIRE BRIGADE/HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (HAZMAT) TEAM\nThis is a combined team of both fire fighting and hazardous material spill response.\nThe fire brigade is a structural fire fighting organization trained to respond to industrial fires.  The Haz Mat responders are trained to the Technician level.\nHazardous material response includes responding to hazardous spills or vapor releases. Responders are trained to use proper equipment and techniques"
