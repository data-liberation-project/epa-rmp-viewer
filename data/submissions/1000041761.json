Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Cooperative Elevator Co. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our  trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Bad Axe Area Fire Dept. which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Storage and transfer of agricultural anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nThe product is stored in a 18,000 gallon capacity tank, which, for safety purposes, is never filled beyond 85% full. There would be 84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the largest  tank when 85% filled.\n\n\n\n                \n\n                                                                                                                                              \n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility complies with the requirements of several regulations, including requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. Is also complies with other Federal, and State regulations.\n\nAdditionally, our facility is inspected regularly by government agencies. Any recommendations made are promptly followed.\n\n\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\n\nCooperative Elevator Co. has a written emerge"

      "SummaryText": "ncy response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nHuron County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. The plan is reviewed at least annually, and promptly updated when necessary.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMore frequent plant safety  inspections are taking place every quarter.  Monthly equipment checks and daily inspections of property take place to ensure no breach of security.  Locks are maintained on all anhydrous storage tanks. We have discontinued to handle rail cars of anhydrous ammonia, so, there will no longer be railcars at the site or in the area."
