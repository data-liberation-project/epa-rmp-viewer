              "Description": "Prevention Program Description\n\nThe Atlas Cold Storage hazardous material release Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems. The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. All components in the system were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRE, ASME, Pressure Vessel Codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of construction. In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency. Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up to running and emergency shut-down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies. \n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protection equipment in an emergency scenario. The hazard analysis (\"what-if\") study helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safely and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases. Lock-out/tag-out procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.                                                                              \n\nSpill containment and clean-up training is important so that effects of a spill are minimized.                                                                     \n\nGeneral employee training involves knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and evacuation procedures.                      \n\nAnnual Internal Corporate Safety Audits include evaluations and recommendations for updating and improving the program.",

This commitment is\n\ndemonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Fire Department/Hazmat Team which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the production, storage and shipping of edible oil products.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility. All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA\n\n\"RMP*COMP\" as well as the EPA \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\". The\n\ndetails of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n"
