This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nMPLX's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  The Vermillion Gas Plant has coordinated with the Rock Springs Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Vermillion Gas Plant is located approximately 55 miles southeast of the town of Rock Springs, Wyoming.\n\nThe Vermillion Gas Plant is a 57 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/day) cryogenic natural gas processing plant. Input to the plant includes sweet wellstream gas. The plant produces a mixed NGL stream of 2,500 barrels per day maximum.  The plant consists of two (2) process trains which operate in a similar fashion and are composed of similar equipment.\n\nThe gas stream is compressed to increase the pressure to allow processing through the Vermillion Gas Plant. The gas next goes through mol-sieve dehydrator beds for final moisture removal.  Out of the mol-sieve dehydrators, the gas is directed to one of two cryogenic turboexpander trains for processing.  The gas from the demethanizer is recompressed by the residue compressors up to sales line pressure and sold down the pipeline.  Natural gas liquids from the processing trains are sent to pressurized storage tanks to await shipment via pipeline to sales markets. \n\nThese substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  MPLX has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about"

The Worst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios are available for review in the background documentation.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  \n\nEmergency Action Program Information:\n\nThe Vermillion Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency action including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\nMPLX employees and contractors receive training in these procedures as necessary.\n\nEmergency Action Plan is updated as needed.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement accident prevention.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMPLX keeps a variety of technical documents that are us"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nMPLX has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nMPLX will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards:"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nEach PHA will address the following:\na) hazards of the process,\nb) previous incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences,\nc) consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls,\nd) engineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships,\ne) facility siting issues,\nf) human factors.\n\nThe PHA team findings are compiled in a written report and are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  The operating procedures are centrally located and accessible to all employees.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Vermillion Gas Plnat has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations unless they provide written certification that they have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their specific duties and responsibilities. All MPLX employees at the Vermillion plant will be trained in PSM/RMP requirement upon hire and prior to working in PSM/RMP processes.  All operations employees will undergo refresher training at least every three years.  A training attendance record will be kept for all training activities and a verification of understanding will be conducted by a performance evaluation or through testing.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMPLX has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity is quality assurance.  The Vermillion Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nMPLX has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nMPLX conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The PSSR confirm that construction was completed in accordance with design specifications, that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.  The PSSR will be reviewed and appropriately updated during the management of change process.  The PSSR will ensure that: modifications were installed as described; no other changes were made outside the original scope of work; operating procedures have been modified and communicated to operating and maintenance personnel; all necessary tests have been completed prior to start-up; all site safety, fire protection, and environmental issues have been addressed; the startup plan has been reviewed; pertinent drawing have been red-lined or updated to as-built requirements; vendor files have been updated; and training of affected personnel has been performed and documented.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, MPLX periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  Team membership will include at least one person knowledgeable of the system being audited.  One member of the team must be qualified to lead the audit and be familiar with the auditing protocol being administered.  Audits will be conducted using the OSHA Verification Checklist CPL2-2.45a and the EPA Audit Guidance Checklist.  The Plant Compliance Coordinator will maintain a listing of all non-conformances i"

The two most recent audit reports will remain on file with the documentation of closed items.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMPLX promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, determine what error states led to the incident and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident.  The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions that are identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nMPLX encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees will be provided with all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\nHot Work Perm"

      "SummaryText": "it\n\nMPLX uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process.  The hot work permit documents the fire prevention and protection requirements prior to beginning hot work operations. The permit indicates the days on which hot work may be performed and the object upon which hot work is to be performed. Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Vermillion Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Vermillion Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years.  Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Vermillion Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
