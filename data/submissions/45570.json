The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Myers, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should and accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of phosphorus and potash for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 455,260 pounds in 53 tanks.  The capacities of each of these tanks are: (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank, (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks, and (50) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of total contents of the storage tank released as a liquid spill and vaporization over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tanks and 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on RMPcomp is 4.4 miles.\n\n\n\n    The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from a transfer hose failure, with 11,908 pounds release over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .5 miles.\n\n\n\n4.    The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K 61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anh"

The Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning community right-to-know information required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements are and on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nMyers, Inc\n\nTowanda, IL \n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary of Risk Management Plan\n\n\n\n"
