It receives crude oil, which it processes into petroleum products, including gasoline, transportation fuels, LPG, and oils.  In addition to the flammable materials associated with crude oil processing, the facility uses hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which is a standard refining application.  The processing of the crude oil results in the generation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur Recovery Units process the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to recover sulfur for sale and to limit SO2 and CO2 emissions to atmosphere at quantities below the allowable limits.  Hydrogen Sulfide and other toxic chemicals, such as ammonia hydrochloric acid, and sulfur dioxide are present in quantities far below the regulated threshold amounts.  \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires ConocoPhillips Company, Ferndale Refinery (ConocoPhillips) to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above threshold quantity (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery.  The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.  The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products.  The facility receives oil from many sources via ship or pipeline, stores it in tanks onsite, and then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, barge or truck.  The refining process separates the crude oil into fi"

The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant quantities of sulfur that must be removed to produce clean burning gasoline and diesel.  The fuel products are also stored in onsite storage prior to shipping, and any non-hydrocarbon products e.g. sulfur is also stored prior to shipping.  The facility also has the utility and support systems required providing for safe operation of the facility.\n\nThe RMP contains two parts required for submittal:\n\n* RMP Executive Summary, Prevention Program Summary, and Management System Summary\n* RMP Data Elements\n\nThe original 1999 RMP effort at the facility was divided into three phases.  First, the facility determined which processes were covered by the RMP regulation.  The results of this study are published in the report titled \"Phase I: Inventory Determination\" which measured the quantities of regulated substances to determine which processes are subject to RMP.  Next, the facility conducted the required hazard assessment as defined by the regulation.  The hazard assessment modeled accidental release scenarios that provided the refinery with insight into the potential for onsite processes to affect the surrounding community and the environment.   Finally, Phase III of the RMP effort is provided in this document.  It contains the executive summary of the overall RMP effort at the facility, a synopsis of the prevention program, a five-year accident history and summary of the management systems in place to implement and maintain the facility's risk management measures.\n\nThe following changes have been made to the RMP submission documents as part of the June, 2009 Update: \n\n* Divided covered refinery processes into separate processing units,\n* Revised hydrofluoric acid Toxic Worst Case Release Scenario to reflect current operations,\n* Added stored LPG railcar inventories,\n* Added another railcar Flammable Alternative Release Scen"

For regulated substances where emergency response planning guidelines (ERPG) values have been established, RMP requires that the ERPG-2 value be used as the toxic endpoint.  RMP also requires an offsite consequence analysis for potential releases of flammable materials.  In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following:\n\n* Explosion: Overpressure of 1 psig.\n* Radiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds.\n* Lower Flammability Limit: a lower flammability limit as provided in NFPA documents or other generally recognized sources.\n\nIn addition, the facility has modeled alternative release scenarios (ARSs), to show release scenarios that may have more realistic chance of occurrence.  The alternative release scenarios allow the facility to present scenarios that assume the use of administrative and actual controls in place at the facility. Even the ARSs are rare events.

As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near-misses that occur within the facility.  This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history.\n\nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\n* Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\n* Offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\n\nThe Facility has had no such accidents in the preceding 5 years.  This is a strong indication of the successful risk management program in practice at the facility.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery.  Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.

This information is essential for having an effective process safety management program and for conducting thorough process hazards analysis.  This includes information regarding process chemicals, process technology and process equipment.  The Process and Project Leads are responsible for the refinery PSI.\n\nPP3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each refinery processing unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PSM Lead is responsible for the PHA program.\n\nThe ConocoPhillips risk matrix is used to qualitatively assign risk to each hazard scenario based on the potential severity and likelihood, given existing control measures.  Any recommendations needed to mitigate a hazardous consequence made in the PHA study receive a priority ranking. Those mitigation recommendations with the highest priority (most severe risk) are handled first. All mitigation recommendations receive a thorough evaluation in a timely manner.  Other risk management tools, such as Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA), and a Safety Integrity Level (SIL) evaluation, are also used to ensure the reliability of safety systems.\n\nThe facility continues to redefine the baseline and revalidate the PHA studies for the processing units on an alternating 5 year schedule, or sooner as changes to the process require.

Safe work practices, such as lock out/ tag out, hot work, etc. are available from the safe work practices database.\n\nPP10.    Management of Change\nThe intent of this procedure is to assume that all modifications to equipment, raw materials and processing condition other than \"replacement in kind\" are safe.  This includes a review of applicable changes using the appropriate PHA method (Checklist, What-If, HAZOP, etc.), and ensuring that all prevention programs are included in the change.  Management of Changes is the responsibility of the PSM Lead, and encompasses all prevention programs.\n\nPP11. Incident Investigation\nThe incident investigation program covers all loss and near loss (near-miss) incidents that occur at the refinery.  Examples of incidents covered by this policy but not limited to are: occupational injuries and illness, unit upsets, production loss, property damage or loss, and environmental incidents such as spills and releases.  Incident investigation is the responsibility of the HSE Manager.\n\nThe purpose of this guideline is to ensure that effective incident reporting and investigation procedures are carried out efficiently.  To be effective, all investigations are conducted in a timely, organized and objective manner.  The purpose of an investigation is not to fix blame, but rather to determine the facts surrounding the incident, present the findings and conclusions, and make recommendations for corrective actions that will prevent a similar occurrence in the future.  An incident investigation team will investigate all incidents a"

Compliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Ferndale Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.\n\nPer WAC 296-67-057, this facility verifies PSM compliance every three years with an audit.  The refinery will retain the two most recent compliance audit reports for inspection. The PSM Lead is responsible for implementing the compliance audit portion of the prevention program.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at the refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the Program level 3 refining processes at the Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSome of the administrative programs to prevent, detect or mitigate an incident at the facility are presented above.  Specific safety equipment and procedures, known as safeguards, are in place at the facility.  These safeguards are listed as part of the process hazard analyses, process safety information, and in the operating procedures.  Some examples of general safeguards are presented below:\n\nRelease Detection\n* Hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen fluoride detectors with alarms\n* Facility alarm system to notify personnel in case of emergency\n* Ambient SO2 Monitoring Station\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n* Pressure Safety Valves (PSVs) to protect all pressure vessels\n* Operating materials recovery system with process flare to incinerate excess materials from the process\n* Manual and automatic valves to pe"

The Facility is a contributor to the community by protecting the plant and neighbors from damaging effects of emergency situations.  The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization before an accident can occur.  In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond control.  The emergency response plan known as the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), along with training and drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects.  Local, state, and federal safety rules dictate the facility to study and under"

The emergency response procedure covers the entire facility, including refinery units that handle or produce regulated substances.  It includes, but is not limited to: first-in response, evacuation, emergency shutdown, decontamination and medical response to chemical exposure, agency notification, public notification if potential for impact, personnel accounting, and clean-up.\n\nTraining for emergency response is handled through the Process Safety Education Department, and is conducted frequently with classroom, tabletop, and live exercises.  As the facility continues to expand, the Emergency Response Plan (ICP) is updated to include the new refinery units and changes to operations. \n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\nThe Refinery Manager is ultimately responsible for implementation of the risk management measures set forth in this document.  The Process Safety Management Lead is responsible for upkeep of the Risk Management Plan and Hazard Assessment, and all supporting documentation.  The individual departments assigned above implement each element of the Prevention Program.\n\nENHANCEMENTS TO SAFETY\nThrough the use of prevention programs such as Management of Change and the Process Hazard Analysis program, ConocoPhillips is constantly re-evaluating the current safety systems. As a result of these programs, and other safety and risk reduction initiatives, improvements to the safety of the workers and the surrounding community continue to occur.

All hazardous consequence mitigation recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nThe following is an example of the types of modifications made to the facility during the period from 1999 to 2009:\n\n1. HF Laser Detectors installed in the acid section of the Alkylation Unit.  These provide a quick detection of a hydrofluoric acid release, and allow operators and the emergency response team to respond accordingly.\n\n2. Acid Inventory Management System implemented in the acid section of the Alkylation Unit, which allows operators to transfer hydrofluoric acid from process unit equipment to a single safe storage location. If a leak were to occur within the process equipment, the operator can activate the emergency acid inventory management systems (AIMS) to reduce the duration of an acid release, and to store the acid in a safe location until the equipment can be repaired.  When the system has been repaired, the acid in the emergency system can be safely transferred back into the process, without requiring any disposal of material.\n\n3. As a result of the Y2K Task Force, the facility experienced no upsets, environmental impacts and no safety concerns as a result of the potential Year 2000 data change problems in electrical equipment.  The changes made to the facility and programs put in place as a result of the Y2K Task Force improve the reliability of the facility's safety systems in the unlikely event of future troubles with power supply, field instrumentation, or other electrical control systems.\n\n4. The facility security has been improved to control access to the refinery process units with the use of card-access and turnstile gates and vehicle gates, to lessen the potential for unauthorized access. \n\n5. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program has been implemented at this facility. \n\nThe following future projects will be implemented to enhance safety:\n\n1.
