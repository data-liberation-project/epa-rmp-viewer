Emergency response will be handled by the Hattiesburg Fire Department's Hazard incident Response Team.\r\n\r\nG.  Construction of a chlorine building at Water Plant #2 has been constructed to deep chlorine cylinders out of direct sunlight and to house chlorinaion equipment.  This building has chlorine leak detectors installed to alert operators of accidental chlorine releases.  Internal training as well as training by outside sources is planned on a regular basis."

The Hattiesburg Water & Sewer Department Accidental release prevention policy involves operational procedures, management practices and continued training to prevent accidental releases. Continued improvement of facilities and procedures will reduce accidental releases.  The emergency response policy involves procedures to notify and coordinate response with local responders.\r\n\r\nB.  Water Plant #2 is one of two water treatment plants that provide drinking water to the City of Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  Chlorine gas is used to disinfect the drinking water supply at this location.  This plant is located in the southeastern section of the city at 900 James Street.  The maximum amount of chlorine at this facility would be six one-ton containers.  This facility has at least one water treatment plant operator on site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  These operators can respond to any trouble that may occur. \r\n\r\nC.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified a worst case release scenario.  Both scenarios were calculated using EPA's RMP*Comp software.\r\n\r\nThe Worst case release scenario involves a failure of a one ton chlorine cylinder with a 10 minute release duration and a release rate of 110 pounds per minute.  This scenario involves a release in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.  The offsite consequence of this scenario are as follows.\r\n1.  Topography:  Urban surroundings(many obstacles in the immediate area)\r\n2.  Toxic Endpoint:  0.0087 mg/l ; basis: ERPG-2\r\n3.  Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.9 miles (1.4 kilometers)\r\n4.  Residential Population Estimate:  2300\r\nThe meterorological assumptions about this scenario are:  Wind speed: 1.5 meters/second(3.4 miles/hour).  Stability Class: F\r\nAir Temperature: 77 degrees F (25 Degrees C)\r\n\r\nD.  The accidental release prevention program is based on the following element"
