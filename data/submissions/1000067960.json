      "SummaryText": "The Air Liquide Bayport facility produces oxygen, Nitrogen, and Argon through the process of air separation.  Two air separation units, associated compressors, Cogeneration Units and Boilers are utilized to produce pipeline nitrogen, oxygen, electricity, and steam.  The Industrial Water Treatment section of the Bayport Complex receives raw water from the City of Houston.  The water is treated to remove algae, silt, solids, etc. from the raw water.  Chlorine is used as a biocide in this process to remove the algae from the water.  The Chlorine is stored in 1 ton cylinders within the water treatment section.  This treated water is either used onsite as cooling and process water or sold to various customers along the water distribution pipeline.  The Bayport Complex has a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan that addresses plant-wide chemical emergencies such as a chlorine release.  This plan is available in the Main Control Room.  The plan contains emergency notification procedures, locations of emergency assembly areas, major site hazards, organization and emergency contact list, roles and responsibilities during an emergency, and detailed step by step actions to be taken in an emergency.   The steps to be taken in a site-wide emergency chlorine release are as follows:  Activate plant alarm, report incident to LEPC and local emergency authorities, evacuate non-essential personnel, proceed to assembly areas, conduct head count, contact emergency response contractor to stop leak and perform off-site air monitoring.  There have been no chlorine releases to the environment in the past 5 years.  Air Liquide is focused on maintaining a strong safety culture where safe practices are followed both on the job and at home.  Air Liquide is committed to safety and strives to improve safety through its safety programs and procedures.\n\n"
