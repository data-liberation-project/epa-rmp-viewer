The facility policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Willard Agri-Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of ammonium hydroxide and Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Kent County Division of Emergency Management, local Fire and Police Departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n  2. Facility information.\n\n       - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers.\n\n       - Ammonium Hydroxide is stored in two 30,000 gallon tanks, which is within an enclosed dike.  The dike would allow rapid recovery of any spilled or released ammonium hydroxide liquid. The maximum quantity stored would be 435,000 pounds in the storage tanks.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in two 30,000 gallon tanks.  The maximum quantity stored would be 265,710 pounds in the storage tanks.\n\n  3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a single 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank released as a toxic gas within 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 132,855 pounds, which represents the volume of a single 30,000 gallon storage tank.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.08 miles.\n\n       b. The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a aqua ammonia transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.08 miles.\n  \n  4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented an accidental release prevention program following generally accepted industry best management practices.  \n\n  5. The five-year accident history \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonium hydroxide in the past five years that:\n  -"

The emergency response program.\n\n  - The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan and submitted the Plan to the Kent County Division of Emergency Management Coordinator, dated February, 2005.\n\n  7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific ammonium hydroxide safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
