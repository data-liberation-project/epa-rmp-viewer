Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\r\nhave been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide\r\nimmediate corrective response to any accidents.\r\n\r\nThe Lake Draper WTP staff are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response\r\nto accidental releases is also coordinated with the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and the State and\r\nLocal Emergency Response Centers.\r\n\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Lake Draper WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the\r\ndrinking water treatment process.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA Hazard Assessment (Process Hazard Analysis) and written process safety information have been developed to\r\nenable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving EHSs. Process safety\r\ninformation includes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia information, technology of the process information, and\r\nequipment information.\r\n\r\nThe Oklahoma City Utilities Engin"

All employees involved in working with and around the chlorine and anhydrous\r\nammonia systems are trained in process and safety procedures, including emergency response on an annual basis.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical integrity of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia process equipment is documented and maintained\r\nthrough maintenance, inspection, and testing programs. In addition, a Management of Change program has been\r\nestablished to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine or anhydrous ammonia systems.\r\n\r\nA pre-startup safety review is performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and\r\nconstruction meet design specifications, procedures and training have been implemented, and hazard analysis\r\nrecommendations have been resolved.\r\n\r\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been implemented. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to\r\nensure that a strong RMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel.\r\n\r\nStaff have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up.
