This Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of,\n\ncatastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up,\n\noperation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Oklahoma City Utilities Department implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including\n\ninspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\n\nhave been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide\n\nimmediate corrective response to any accidents.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Draper WTP staff are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response\n\nto accidental releases is also coordinated with the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and the State and\n\nLocal Emergency Response Centers.\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Lake Draper WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the\n\ndrinking water treatment process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Hazard Assessment (Process Hazard Analysis) and written process safety information have been developed to\n\nenable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving EHSs.
