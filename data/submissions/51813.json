      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Hunterstown Power Plant Complex includes an 890 MW nominal rated combined-cycle power plant (HCPP) and an 81 MW (winterload) combustion turbine (CT ) site.  The CT Site first went into operation in 1971 and includes three dual fuel (oil/natural gas) fired General Electric PG5331 combustion turbine generator units.   The combined cycle power plant  began commercial operation in 2003 and has three General Electric PG7251FB combustion-turbine generators, each 180 MW nominal rating, three Alstom triple-pressure heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) each equipped for supplemental firing capability, and one General Electric reheat condensing steam turbine generator, 350-MW nominal rating.  \n\n \n\nThe facility is located on about 307 acres in Straban Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania, one mile southwest of Hunterstown.  The CT's and HCCPP provide electricity to the PJM network. The site and equipment are owned by GenOn Energy of Houston, Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\n\n\nGenOn Energy's policy is to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those for accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\na. PRIMARY ACTIVITIES: This facility is a natural gas- and oil-fired electric-power generating station.\n\n\n\nB. USE OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia injection system at HCCP is designed to remove NOx from combustion gas by selective catalytic reduction.  This will be accomplished by injecting a 29-percent ammonia solution into the combustion gas before it is passed over a catalyst. \n\n\n\nNo other toxic or flammable materials will be stored at the facility in quantities above the regulatory threshold.\n\n\n\nC. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED \n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia system is comprised of one 30,000-gallon storage tank, pumps, and piping, instrumentation and controls.  The storage tank is in a conc"

WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nA 30,000-gallon tank is used to store aqueous ammonia.  The WCS assumes that the entire contents of the storage tank are released instantaneously, and the ammonia evaporates over time.  The WCS can include the effects of passive mitigation systems, and for HCCPP this is the use of secondary containment to minimize ammonia liquid spills.  The quantity released is calculated as:\n\n\n\n     30,000 gallons * 7.43 lb/gal = 222,900 lb\n\n\n\nPer EPA guidance, because the horizontal surface area of the secondary containment system (1,950 ft2) is less than that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool) the rate at which the material is released is calculated as:\n\n\n\n     QR  = 1.4 ? LFA ? A\n\n\n\nwhere: QR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\n\n            1.4 = Wind speed factor\n\n            LFA = Liquid Factor Ambient\n\n            A = Diked area (square feet)\n\n\n\n     1.4 x 0.026 x 1,950 ft2  = 71 lb/minute\n\n\n\nTherefore the WCS release duration is:\n\n\n\n     222,900 lb / 71 lb/minute x 1 hour/60 minutes = 52 hours\n\n\n\nb. ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\n\n\nThis scenario assumes that some of the contents (1,000 gallon) of an ammonia tanker truck are spilled due to hose rupture (no secondary containment).  The quantity released in the event is calculated as:\n\n\n\n     1,000 gallons / 7.48 gal/ft3 = 134 ft3\n\n\n\n     1,000 gallons x 7.43 lb/gal = 7,430 lbs\n\n\n\nPer EPA guidance, the horizontal surface area of the spill is that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter deep pool).  The pool area is calculated as:\n\n\n\n     134 ft3 / 0.033 = 4,061 ft2 (1-cm deep pool)\n\n\n\nThe quantity released is thus calculated as:\n\n\n\n     QR  = QS ? 1.4 ? LFA ? DF\n\n\n\nwhere: QR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\n\n            QS = Quantity released (pounds)\n\n            1.4 = Wind speed factor\n\n  "

      "SummaryText": "          LFA = Liquid Factor Ambient\n\n            DF = Density Factor\n\n\n\n     7,430 lbs x 1.4 x 0.026 x 0.55 = 149 lb/minute\n\n\n\nTherefore the ARS release duration is:\n\n\n\n     7,430 lb / 149 lb/minute = 50 minutes\n\n\n\nBecause the ammonia tank truck has excess flow valves which would close upon the increase in flow from a hose rupture, this is an unlikely scenario.\n\n\n\nC. DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT \n\n\n\nThe offsite consequences of this accidental release were evaluated with a screening computer dispersion model (RMP*Comp, version 1.07).  Offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case scenario must include the following weather conditions: a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mph), \"F\" atmospheric stability class, a temperature of 77?F, and relative humidity of 50%.  The maximum calculated distance to the worst case scenario endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 0.5 miles. The endpoint represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst-case or alternative weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public.  There are public receptors in the impact areas for the worst-case scenario, and thus this facility is subject to RMP Program 2.\n\n\n\nMore typical meteorological parameters were used in analyzing the alternative release scenario, including a mean wind speed of 3 m/s (6.7 mph) and \"D\" atmospheric stability. The maximum calculated distances to the alternative release scenario endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 0.3 miles. There are no public receptors in the impact areas for the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThere are many safety programs in place at the station to minimize the potential for the accidental releases of ammonia considered by this plan.  For example:\n\n\n\n>The ammonia storage tank is a registered pressure vessel that is built to exacting standards.\n\n\n\n>Ammonia tank trucks will only be unloaded during daylight hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.
