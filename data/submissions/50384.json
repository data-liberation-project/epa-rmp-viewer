Liquid ammonia is pumped from the Separator to several end users, such as air coolers, vessel jackets, plate heat exchangers and air coolers.  Evaporated ammonia is suctioned back to the compressor units, followed by condensation at the evaporative condensers located at the top of the Compressor Room.  Condensed ammonia is then collected back at the Receiver.",
