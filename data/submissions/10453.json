This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. The following is a statement from Bear Paw Energy Senior Management.  Bear Paw Energy Inc. believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees.  Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures.  Employees of Bear Paw Energy Inc. are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies.  Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\nThe Wiggins Gas Plant, located in Morgan Co., Colorado, uses refrigeration to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, an EPA regulated flammable mixture (butane, ethane, isobutane, isopentane, methane, pentane, and propane) is processed, recovered, and stored at the facility. There are two 6,000 gallons and one 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The Wiggins plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.  The facility is unmanned.  \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with"

      "SummaryText": "a release of flammable substances in Program Level 2 process at the Wiggins Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 70,415 pounds of hydrocarbon mix from the station\u0012s largest storage vessel.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.4 mile.  Three public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.4 mile radius.  Identified public receptors were two residences and a business shop.  Residential population within the 0.4 mile radius is estimated at 10 people.  \n\nThe selected alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the station is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 510 pounds of flammable mixture due to a 2 loading hose failure during product loading.  The release was minimized by an excess flow valve located upstream of the load hose.   The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.06 mile.  Zero public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.06mile radius.  No residential receptors were identified.  Estimated residential population within the 0.06mile radius is 0 people.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Wiggins Gas Plant complies with EPA\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The plant was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA, API, ASME, and other codes and regulations.  All of our operators have been thoroughly trained in plant operation, safety,process hazards, and emergency response.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurrin"

We have had NO releases, associated with the plant\u0012s EPA regulated substances, that resulted deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion.  Company employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. If an emergency were to occur, the station\u0012s emergency response plan provides instructions to employees for notification of the local fire authority Wiggins Fire Department, Morgan County LEPC, and Sheriff\u0012s office.\n\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant\u0012s operation or equipment, changes in receptors, or responders.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n7 Upgrade training."
