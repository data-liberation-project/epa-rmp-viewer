The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario would be a complete rupture failure of a propane storage tank leading to a complete loss of the product in the tank.  Other tank failures were evaluated as well but the propane tank led to the largest radius in the worst-case scenario computations. The alternative-case scenario is described as a hose failure during loading of a railcar or tanker truck which would lead to a release.  This release is described as a five-minute release until the valves are completely shut off, which would lead to up to 5,000 gallons (24,000 pounds) of propane being released.  Additional alternative-case scenarios were considered including leaking components; however, none of the other cases were more likely to occur or would have a greater release than the alternative scenario chosen.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternative-case radius of impact were determined using the EPA RMP-COMP model.  Populations within that radius were determined using the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS), Version 10c using data from Summary File 1, 2010 Census and by inputing the coordinate points and the radius of influence.  \r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \r\n\tSteps\r\n\r\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.  The propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline, and NGL storage and distribution processes at MarkWest are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM)"

(MarkWest) - Hopedale facility located in Jewett, Ohio is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Harrison County, Ohio Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses the fractionation of natural gas liquids (NGLs).  The NGL stream is separated into purity products of Propane, Iso-Butane, N-Butane, and Natural Gasoline, which consists of Iso-Pentane and Normal-Pentane amongst other things.  Ehtyl Mercaptan is also stored at the site and is used as an odorant in some propane shipments.  \r\n\r\nThe NGL are received through NGL pipelines to the facility.  They are separated using extraction towers with specific heats and pressures to isolate each purity product.  Once separated the products are stored in storage tanks at the site awaiting shipment via pipeline, truck or rail.  \r\n\r\nThe total quantity of product stored in the vessels and the total of each substance over the threshold for RMP substances has been calculated in a separate document that is available for review but is not included in this summary as it may contain confidential business information.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative R"

In addition, MarkWest employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP program, in particular, information relating to and resulting from process hazard analysis. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nPeriodically, MarkWest hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is undertaken.  MarkWest has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards relating to the contractor's work and the associated processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nMarkWest has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nA written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances is retained at the MarkWest facility.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe Harrison County, Ohio LEPC is the local emergency response agencies with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \r\n\r\nMarkWest will continue to monitor the implementation of the RMP program at the Hopedale facility to ensure that accidental release of flammable materials does not occur.  \r\n\r\n8.\tConclusion\r\n\r\nM"

      "SummaryText": "standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nMarkWest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.  The hazard and operability (HAZOP) study in conjunction with the What If? and checklist methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels,"
