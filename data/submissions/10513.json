Messer GmbH has developed Safety, Health and Environmental guidelines that have been incorporated in a comprehensive program defined as Loss Prevention Policies. These policies are the minimal standards for Messer America's operations, including the Morrisville, PA cylinder gas production facility.\n\nThe objective of the program is to achieve an acceptable level of performance in the prevention of the losses to the organization which include but are not limited to accidents, injuries, illnesses, product liabilities and regulatory non-conformities. To be effective, this management system must be totally integrated in which all levels of employees are involved and held accountable.\n\nThe ultimate authority for instituting an effective Loss Prevention Program rests with the senior management of each operating group. Through their words and more importantly through their actions, senior management sets the tone for loss prevention throughout Messer Americas. While senior management set the tone, middle management must create the uniform support and nurture the desired culture to influence the Loss Prevention Program. This strong management commitment culminates with the day to day responsibilities of implementing and managing the Loss Prevention Program by 'line management' (supervisors and lead personnel). Local management is accountable for the effective management of this program through their organization's performance as related to loss prevention and regulatory com"

As part of the operation, large quantities of chemicals are stored in bulk tanks or large cylinders for transfilling to smaller cylinders or for making specialty gas mixtures.

Because of their proximity to each other, they will be considered to be part of a single process. The default meteorological conditions were assumed and the consequence distances were obtained from the tables given in Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidelines (OCAG) for an unmitigated release of the entire contents of both the pressurized storage tanks in 10 minutes.

The plant has an evacuation plan based on a three level alarm system of lights and audible signals. The plant has a LEL (Lower Explosive Limit) monitoring system and a toxic gas monitoring system installed at appropriate work areas. The propane and propylene storage tanks are protected with sprinklers and have excess flow shut off protection. All toxic chemicals are transferred or blended in fume hoods that are vented into 'permitted' scrubber units. All of the RMP processes come under Process Safety Management (PSM) rules and have been reviewed and audited in the past year.         \n      \nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere were no accidental releases of any of the RMP regulated chemicals from the MG Industries cylinder gas plant in Morrisville, PA during the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMG Industries has a state qualified and extensively trained emergency response team consisting of 14 members. This team currently responds to any customer site if a MG Industries product cylinder is involved. The team captains also meet quarterly with local municipality response organizations and other local industrial gas companies to review joint capabilities for responding to both on-site and off-site incidents.  All our emergency programs are coordinated with the Bucks County Emergency Planning authorities, the Bucks County LEPC and the Falls township Fire Marshall. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improved Safety\n\nMG Industries is committed to continually improving our safety performance for all the operating units of the business.
