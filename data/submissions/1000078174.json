Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Bear River Supply, Inc., Rio Oso Facility (herein referred to as BRSI or the Facility) at 218 Pleasant Grove Road, Rio Oso, California 95674 are committed to the prevention of an accidental release of aqua ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nES-2.  Facility Information and Stationary Substances Handled\n\n?*  The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\n?*  Aqua ammonia  is received by truck, stored in two, 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.\n\n?*  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia (20.66%) stored at the site is 154,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nES-3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements for the management of the aqua ammonia.\n\n\n\nSafety Information: BRSI ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees. The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on March 7, 2019.\n\n\n\nHazard Review: A hazard review of the regulated processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes. The most recent update of the hazard review was conducted on March 7, 2019. Results indicate that no high-risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Written standard operating procedures have been developed f"

The operating procedures were last revised on March 7, 2019.\n\n\n\nTraining: The BRSI staff, as well as the Butte County Rice Growers Association (BUCRA) corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The training program was last reviewed on March 7, 2019. The current training program is comprised of the following:\n\n*  Initial employee training;\n\n?*  Periodic refresher training;\n\n?*  Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\n\n?*  Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\n\n?*  Training records for each employee.\n\n\n\nMaintenance: The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventive maintenance, recordkeeping, and training. The latest equipment inspections were conducted on April 22, 2019 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on March 7, 2019.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on March 30, 2018.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: An incident investigation program is in place at the Facility and incident investigation procedures would be implemented, if needed.\n\n\n\nOther Code Applicability: The Facility implements the provisions of the following guidelines, regulations, and standards for these regulated substances (part"
