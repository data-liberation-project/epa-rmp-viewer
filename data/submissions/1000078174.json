Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of aqua ammonia during the last five years resulting in death, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, or property or environmental damage.\n\nES-5.  The Emergency Response Program\nThe Facility's emergency response program has been developed in accordance with the following regulations:\n\u0081*  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38; \n\u0081*  US EPA 40 CFR Subpart E Emergency Response; and\n\u0081*  Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code, Hazardous Materials Business Plan.\n\nThe Emergency Response/Contingency Plan was updated and will be implemented in the event of a release of a regulated substance.\n\nES-6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going activity at the Facility. Periodic evaluations will be performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. Specific changes to the aqua ammonia processes at the Facility will be implemented as needed.\n\nES-7.  The Worst-case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\nAqua Ammonia Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios. The worst-case release scenario is a release of 77,000 pounds of aqua ammonia, the volume of the largest storage tank when full, into the secondary containment berm, modeled with an increased wind speed and F Stability modeling parameters. The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a release from a pipe break within the secondary containment berm, modeled with an increased wind speed and D Stability modeling parameters. The toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is at 0.36 miles downwind; the alternative release has a toxic endpoint that is 0.14 miles downwind from the point of release."

A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The current training program is comprised of the following:\n*  Initial employee training;\n\u0081*  Periodic refresher training;\n\u0081*  Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\n\u0081*  Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\n\u0081*  Training records for each employee.\n\nMaintenance: The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventive maintenance, recordkeeping, and training. \n\nCompliance Audits: Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. \n\nIncident Investigation: An incident investigation program is in place at the Facility and incident investigation procedures would be implemented, if needed.\n\nOther Code Applicability: The Facility implements the provisions of the following guidelines, regulations, and standards for these regulated substances (partial list):\nRegulated Substances\n*  United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.38, Employee emergency response plan and fire prevention plans.\n\u0081*  United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter C, Part 68, Subpart E, Emergency Response\n\nAqua Ammonia\n*  American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 31.3 Process Piping; and\n\u0081*  California Fire"

Facility Accidental Release Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of the Bear River Supply, Inc., Rio Oso Facility (herein referred to as BRSI or the Facility) at 218 Pleasant Grove Road, Rio Oso, California 95674 are committed to the prevention of an accidental release of aqua ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\nES-2.  Facility Information and Stationary Substances Handled\n\u0081*  The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\u0081*  Aqua ammonia  is received by truck, stored in three, 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.\n\u0081*  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia (20.66% NH3 by weight, has a liquid density of 7.7 pounds per gallon at 60 \u00b0F and 1.59 lbs of NH3 per of solution) stored at the site is 231,000 pounds.\n\nES-3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements for the management of the aqua ammonia.\n\nSafety Information: BRSI ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees. \n\nHazard Review: A hazard review of the regulated processes is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the processes.  Results indicate that no high-risk hazards were identified through the hazard review update.\n\nOperating Procedures: Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed. \n\nTraining: The BRSI staff,"
