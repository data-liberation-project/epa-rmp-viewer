In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nBob Evans Farms is located at 640 Birch Rd., Xenia, Ohio.  We manufacture some of the finest pork products in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. Facility produces and ships approximately 50 million pounds of finished product each year.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains 10880 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nBob Evans Farms has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. \n\nBob Evans Farms has organized the information and polic"

The facility incorporates a standard evaporation and compression ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia vapor, High Stage Suction (HSS), from the +15( Recirculator Package (RFR02) equipped with 2 refrigerant pumps (RP1 and RP2) routed from (RFR02) to the suction inlet of 2 High Stage Screw Compressors (CMP6500 and CMP6501). Also connected, a Swing Compressor (CMP6512). Ammonia vapor, Low Stage Suction (LSS), from the -10( Accumulator (RFR05) to the suction inlet of 2 Low Stage Screw Compressors (CMP6507 and CMP6508).\n\nAll compressors are equipped with Thermosyphon oil coolers. Thermosyphon Supply (TSS) and Thermosyphon Return (TSR) are routed to and from the Thermosyphon Vessel (RFR03). This provides cooling for all (HSS and LSS Compressors). \n\nAt the High and Low Stage Compressors (HSS) vapor is compressed to a super heated vapor High Stage Discharge (HSD). (HSD) from the High Stage Compressors is routed to three Evaporative Condensers (CND6408, CND6410, and CND6514).\n \nAt the Evaporative Condensers the (HSD) rejects heat and converts to high-pressure Condensed Liquid Drain (CLD).  The Evaporative Condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across  ammonia coils. The (CLD) from the three Evaporative Condensers drains to the  Receiver (RCV6150). The Receiver (RCV6150) and Thermosyphon Vessel (RFR03) has a Equalizer (EQL). The vapor from the receiver and thermosyphon vessel is returned to the top of the (HSD) main at the Evaporative Condensers to Equalize (EQL) the pressure between the Evaporative Condensers and the Receiver and Thermosyphon Vessel. EQL is re-condensed into a CLD and returned to the  Receiver (RCV6150) and Thermosyphon Vesse"

The facilitator takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the facilitator determines that the ammonia level is above 25 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\n\nThe Maintenance Manager determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted. The Maintenance Manager then takes appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\n\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\nBob Evans Farms is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Bob Evans Farms to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system. \n\nAmong the improvements slated for completion in 1999-2000 is an extensive operator training program, policy updates, additional emergency responder training, the addition of more safety equipment, modifications to the ammonia detection system, and a complete Mechanical Integrity Inspection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Evans Farms X Executive Summary.txt        Page 6 of 7"
