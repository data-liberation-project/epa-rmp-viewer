This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Kenai refinery, located in Nikiski, Alaska, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., diesel, jet fuel, pentane, propane,and butane from raw crude oil.  The refinery uses or produces several regulated flammables, such as pentane, propane, butane, ethane and methane.\n\nAs part of this 2009 update, Tesoro recalculated process volumes for each unit using detailed engineering calculations. This was done because we also used these detailed quantities in a facility siting assessment and the RBMI (Risk Based Mechanical Integrity) program. The revised estimate of flammable volumes in the Vacuum Unit dropped from 298,000 pounds to 3,000 pounds, removing it from the list of covered processes.\n\t \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe original hazard assessment using both a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario for the Tesoro refinery was reviewed to ensure all modeling inputs, including process volumes and composition, are still valid. The offsite consequence analysis was updated with a new \u00c2\u00bfalternative release scenario\u00c2\u00bf which replaced the previous scenenario and to reflect current population estimates. \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY"

      "SummaryText": "At Tesoro we are proud of our safety performance.  The Kenai refinery has had an excellent record of accident prevention since the start of our operation in 1969.  In fact, we have never experienced an incident that impacted people or property outside of the refinery since 1969.  One reason for our success at preventing accidents is that we investigate even minor incidents promptly and thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  Thus, we can eliminate many incidents before they become problems.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Kenai refinery. This program includes the required elements of our Process Safety Management program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Kenai refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Refinery Safety Program.  Regularly held safety meetings in each department are one way in which employee's are able to participate in the review and development of programs and work practices. Any employee can enter(write)Incident Reports or write a Safety Suggestion if they have concerns over personnel or process safety. Tesoro also started a (volunteer) behavior based safety program called the \u00c2\u00bfEagles\u00c2\u00bf which audits regularly for behavioral based safety issues.  Other specific ways that employees can be involved in the Refinery Safety Program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Kenai refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  The documents address chemical properties and a"

Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The refinery has developed procedures for operating the processes within safe limits for temperature, level, composition, etc.  The refinery ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Kenai refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Kenai refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most sys"

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed and resolved by local management. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Kenai refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Kenai refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  They are"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators as electronic files on PCs located in the control rooms and in hard copy for all emergency procedures.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Kenai refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process related duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Before operating in a process operators must be certified by demonstrating adequate skill and knowledge in that specific process.  All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted routinely with the maximum time frame to be at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Kenai refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: \n(1)\tPerform their work in a safe manner;\n(2)\tHave the appropriate knowledge and skills;\n(3)\tAre aware of the hazards in their workplace;\n("

This orientation provides contractors with the general knowledge of the refinery operations, its hazards, work practices, and evacuation procedures for emergencies.\n\nThe Kenai refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Tesoro Corporate has its refineries using \u00c2\u00bfPICS\u00c2\u00bf (Pacific Industrial Contractor Screening), a third party consulting company who evaluates and monitors contractor qualifications and safety records. Contractors are to be approved by PICS before they enter the Refinery. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. The Eagles (behavioral based safety program) also do observations on contractors as well as have some trained observers in the Eagles program who are contractors. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe Kenai refinery conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assu"
