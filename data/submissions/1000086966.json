Legal ownership will remain the same (same tax ID # also). The facility and owner name has been updated in CDX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 2020 General Executive Summary for Dow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations \n\n\n\nRevisions to the Plan: \n\n\n\nRevisions to the October 30th, 2019 plan are being submitted on April 22nd, 2020 for the following reasons:\n\n\n\nRemoval of Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nRemoved Chlorine, Anhydrous HCl, Phosphorus Trichloride and Phosphorus Oxychloride from 1028 since the previous processes at the plant have been shut down and cleaned out.  They have blown out the pipelines within their block limits and installed blind flanges to the site header for Chlorine and Anhydrous HCl on October 25th, 2019. The plant sent the last of the PCl3 and POCl3 off in a waste trailer on March 9th, 2020. They are no longer using these chemicals at their facility.\n\n\n\nAdded Non-Applicability Document for New Process: \n\n\n\nThe 1028 plant is starting up a new production process, Spinetoram in late summer this year.  The process will have two RMP regulated chemicals Hydrogen and Ethylene, however both will be below the threshold limit of 10,000 lbs. The plant will only have a maximum of 550 lbs of Hydrogen and 100 lbs of Ethylene inside it's block limits at a time. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mit"

There are three (3) covered processes, seven (7) programs and six (6) regulated substances present at the stationary source.  \n\nThe regulated substances are listed below.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\n\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous)\n\nChlorine\n\nCrotonaldehyde [2-butenal]\n\nDimethylamine\n\nSulfur dioxide\n\nVinylidene chloride\n\n\n\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection\n\n\n\nThere was one (1) worst case toxic and one (1) worst case flammable scenario reported in this submittal. There are five (5) total alternate cases reported, one of which is a flammable case.  Most of the toxic alternate cases were reported due to that being the only alternate case for the chemical.  No toxic alternate cases for chlorine impacted a population, so the scenario reported for chlorine was the only alternate case that reached an endpoint off-site. The flammable alternate case was chosen due to it being the closest scenario to affect a population based on the location in the plant.  It has the closest scenario with an endpoint to an off-site location. EPA RMP*Comp and MARPLOT were used to evaluate the worst and alternate case scenarios. \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nDow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
