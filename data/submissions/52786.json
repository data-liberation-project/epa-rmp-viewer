      "SummaryText": "La Virgencita Filtration Plant is located at the State Road PR-8165 kilometer 0.3 on San Jose Ward in the municipality of Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, 00950. This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency. PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated  with the storage and handling of the toxic subtance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine. The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68. The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Prtocess Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119. La Virgencita Filtration Plant is out of service and making a star-up works.\n\nAccidental  Release:\n\nIt is PRASA  policy to comply with applicable Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason  La Virgencita Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls. Changes have been put in place to improve security and as part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors , visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nLa Virgencita Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the palnt supply the potable water. The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\nThe Plant Plans to recived chlorine  delivered from the PRASA Storage Center in Puerto Nuevo, in one (1) ton containers. La Virgencita Filtration Plant has expected a maximun storage volume of 12,000 pounds distributed in six (6) containers. The process design define as two containers connected to chlorinators from wich the chlorine flows to the injectors and then the chlorinated water sent to two (2) diferent injection points along the process of the plant.  \n\nWorts Case Senario\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was "

      "SummaryText": "determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F  Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants. This guidance considers the release of a chlorine gas  entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, wich is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above wich it is determined human health will be affected. Using the Landview 6 Simulator and the US CENSUS 2000, it was identified that 10,020 public receptors are inside the 1.3 mile radio. No known environmental receptors (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area. The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used, to simulate the gas dispersion.\nAlternative Case Scenario: The more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a pipe leak. In the case the end point distance in calculated at 0.1 miles none public receptors were identified over the most recent map. Also no know envirenmental receptors are located within the radio area.                                                                                                                             \nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program: PRASA is actually in a very agrgressive operation to implement a Prevention Program Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integity of the facility wich will improve significantly the safety scope of current prevention plans. Standard Operational Procedures (SOP's) are already in place to comply the OSHO and PROSHO requirents in order to keep all improved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine. List of all SOP'S are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.                                  "

Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warming of any leak.  Leak repair kits are kept on site, and operators are trained in how to quickly stop any leak that may occur.  The emergency response program is coordinated with Emergency Management Agency for notification of the public.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nSince 2004 the filtration plant is out of service, no mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) pounds has been reported.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA  has been implementing in La Virgencita Filtration Plant, a vacuum operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage. It is still needed to reinforced administrative activities related to containers handling and transportation, employee's training, emergency personal protective maintenance and audits. Recommendations were given on that regard on last PHA dated October 10 2008."
