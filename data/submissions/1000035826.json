      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe BP Whiting Refinery, located in Whiting, Indiana, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our refinery adheres to federal and state regulations, industry standards and practices, internal process safety policies and guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on years of company and industry experience.  Examples of specific resource material are: the Process Safety Booklets, the BP Engineering Technical Practices, the Whiting Site Technical Practices, the BP Refining Defined Practices, and the Corporate Engineering Specifications.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe BP Whiting Refinery processes 410,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), chemical feedstocks, etc.  The refinery has twenty-one processes that contain materials above the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity and are, therefore, covered by the regulation.  Of these processes, ten qualify for Program 1 coverage and eleven qualify for Program 3 coverage.  Twenty of the twenty-one covered processes contains regulated flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The flammable mixtures typically contain various regulated substances such as hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.  Two of the twenty-one covered processes contain regulated toxic mixtures of hydrogen sulfide that are above the threshold quantity of 10,00"

The purpose in calculating these types of scenarios is to encourage dialogue between industry and the surrounding community on chemical accident prevention and risk reduction.  The BP Whiting Refinery has performed these calculations using the methodology given in the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document.  The results have been provided to the EPA and the Lake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and shared with members of the local community and our employees.  The BP Whiting Refinery employs many layers of safety to reduce risk and to prevent chemical accidents.\r\n\r\nFlammable Worst Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for flammable substances, as required by the RMP regulation, is a vapor cloud explosion with an overpressure endpoint of one pound per square inch.  The worst case scenario endpoint is based on the instantaneous release, vaporization, and vapor cloud explosion of the entire contents of the largest vessel in a process filled to capacity.  This event is highly unlikely to occur.  Although numerous controls to prevent such releases are in place, no credit for administrative controls, passive mitigation systems, safety systems, or personnel intervention can be taken into account in developing the worst case scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP regulation requires that each facility develop and submit at least one worst case scenario for flammable chemicals on site, to represent all Program Level 3 processes.  Additional scenarios must be reported if they can potentially impact a part of the community not impacted by other worst case scenarios.  Due to the large geographic area covered by the BP Whiting Refinery, there are a total of five worst case scenarios to represent all Program Level 3 processes.  All Program Level 1 processes were included to demonstra"

Under this scenario, the release is isolated by operators within ten minutes.  In evaluating the alternative release scenario, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation systems.  The maximum distance to the one psi endpoint reaches off-site, just beyond the refinery fenceline and extend into an industrial site.  This release scenario was selected based on refinery history, and is therefore a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\r\n\r\nToxic Worst Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for toxic substances, as required by the RMP regulation, is a release over a ten minute period of the largest toxic inventory held within a single vessel or piping section.

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe BP Whiting Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In particular, employees are involved in accident investigations, writing procedures, training other operators and the work permitting process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the BP Whiting Refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include standing teams to promote both process and personal safety.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Operations personnel within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the process safety overview information for each process to help employees and visitors quickly locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table.    Process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) help insure the processes are maintained within these limits.  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\r\n\r\nThe BP Whiting Refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe BP Whiting Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique as the basis for these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the PHA team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the BP Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.  The results an"

Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration and their final resolution is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe BP Whiting Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the BP Whiting Refinery maintains a Safe Operating Limit Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Whiting Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety site rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: (1) process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the BP Whiting Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe BP Whiting Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the BP Whiting Refinery has procedures that address the ongoing maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the BP Whiting Refinery is coordinated with the Lake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The BP Whiting Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as fac"
