Facility operations include chemical loading/unloading by truck, material storage; chemical processing, waste collection, storage and treatment; and steam generation. In all phases of its operation, the Plant stresses safety and protection of the environment.\n\nThe plant is currently composed of the following four operating areas:\n\n\u00bf\tCopolymer Area - Production of ion exchange resins used in water treatment and purification, sugar refining, food and beverage processing, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\u00bf\tGoal\u00ae Area - Production of Goal\u00ae Herbicide for use on ornamental plantings, turf plantings, and tree fruit.  Goal\u00a9 is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Agrosciences Inc.\n\u00bf\tAmbersorb Area - Production of Ambersorb product, used in decontamination and remediation activities.  This production area typically operates only 4-6 weeks per year.\n\u00bf\tFacilities Area - Includes steam generation and waste water pre-treatment.\n\nWe are pleased to provide information on our safety and emergency preparedness plans, as well as the systems and training to prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n3.0\tRegulated Substances\n\nOur plant uses one chemical on the RMP list: \n\n\u00b7\tNitric Acid (HNO3 90%),  an RMP toxic used in the production of Goal\u00ae herbicide. \n\nRMP calculations for Nitric Acid have been adjusted to account for the actual concentration of HNO3 in the mixture. \n\n\n4.0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy       \n\nRohm and Haas Philadelp"

All plant employees are trained on the relevant aspects of the emergency response plan.  \n\n\n 8.0\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requirements that define a worst case scenario (WCS), namely a release of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel occurring under very stable weather conditions and at a low wind speed that results in the greatest distance to an \u00bfendpoint\u00bf  In general terms, the distance to the \u00bfendpoint\u00bf is the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  EPA notes that the worst case scenario is designed principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for emergency planning.  Based on previous history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, the worst-case scenario is highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternate release scenario (ARS). Unlike the worst case scenario, the ARS can be limited by active mitigation safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.  According to EPA, an ARS is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders and for emergency response preparedness and planning. \n\nThe WCS and ARS include administrative and mitigation measures which will act to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  Please refer to section 5.0 for Administrative controls.  Mitigation measures include the following:  Deluge system, remote fire monitor nozzle, containment dike system with sumps and drains, and safety interlock systems.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:  Rohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified one WCS based on the RMP definition. \n\nRMP Defined Worst Case Scenario\n\nThis scenario involves Nitric"

It assumes the loss of the entire inventory of a 6,260 gallon (78,250 pound) storage tank inside a containment dike with an area of 683 square feet, and a floor drain which would passively remove any overflow from the dike area.  This scenario takes the following passive mitigation systems into account:\nA containment dike that will contain tank contents, a bermed tankwagon loading/unloading station, and below grade sumps and drains to the chemical sewer within the dike area.\nThese passive mitigation systems would all act to reduce a spill pool area such that the vaporization rate to the atmosphere would be significantly reduced.  The PHAST dispersion model was used to determine the toxic endpoint of this release, and such a release could have a significant off-site impact.  The PHAST dispersion model has identified a toxic endpoint distance of 0.74 miles.  This release could affect the surrounding community which includes: residences, schools, recreation areas, major commercial, office, and industrial areas, and Interstate 95 depending on the weather conditions and the wind direction.  \n\nBecause of the plant controls, procedures, and training, this worst case event is considered highly unlikely.  \n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario:  Rohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified one ARS based on the RMP definition. \n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - Nitric Acid (Toxic Liquid)\n\nRohm and Haas Philadelphia has identified one Alternate Release Scenario for Nitric Acid.  This scenario was chosen after reviewing process hazard analysis, the plant spill history, and discussing alternatives with knowledgeable and experienced unit personnel.  The scenario we have identified is more credible than that described in the worst case, but is still highly unlikely given the multiple levels of protection and extensive employee training.  The following provides a description of our alternate case scenario.\nIf a rupture occurred"

      "SummaryText": "in the 1-1/2\u00bf transfer line from the tank truck to the storage tank, 6,300 lbs of Nitric Acid (90%) would be released outside.  The tank truck unloading operation is constantly attended by an operator per DOT regulations.  It is assumed that the release would be physically detected by the operator and stopped within 10 minutes.  The release would be contained in a sloped and diked area as the tank truck, storage tank and piping are all within a diked area.  This containment would reduce the pool area, thereby reducing the Nitric Acid vaporization rate.  The unloading area is equipped with a deluge system and a remote fire monitor nozzle to assist with mitigation. The PHAST dispersion model was used to determine the toxic endpoint.  The PHAST dispersion model has identified a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 miles.  This release could affect plant employees, and the employees of the Frankford Arsenal to the north, depending on the weather conditions and the wind direction. There are no residences or environmental receptors within the alternate release toxic endpoint circle.  \n\n\n9.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe plant focus on safety is strong throughout the Rohm and Haas Company.  Rohm and Haas continuously looks for ways to reduce risks and to improve safety performance.  Our safety program is integrated into all parts of plant operation and involves the identification and implementation of ways to improve safety performance.  Nitric Acid will continue to be managed under the PSM and RMP regulations"
