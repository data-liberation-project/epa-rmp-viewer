Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of all Americold facilities located in California, to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Americold implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nAmericold Anaheim is located at 1415 N Raymond Ave in the city of Anaheim, California just north of the 91 freeway. The area immediately surrounding the facility is commercial.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of Americold is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 13,453 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler/freezer storage, and glycol under floor heating.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum 0 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 130 psig on the high side of the system.   \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVEN"

      "SummaryText": "TION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\n3) California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Americold to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Americold employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will alarm at 25 ppm and cease the supply of liquid ammonia to the area of the warehouse in which the detection occurred.  This prevents the quantity released from escalating.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the Americold Chief Engineer.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there have been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n- Save lives;\n\n- Minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- Protect the environment; and\n\n- Minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel will respond to an ammonia release at the facility which poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis (performed on March 2019), including a What if/checklist study\n\nand a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Americold - Anaheim. The Americold - Anaheim safety\n\ncommittee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety/PSM plan/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety/PSM plan de"
