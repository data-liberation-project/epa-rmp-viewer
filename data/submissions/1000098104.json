EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Sylvamo Ticonderoga mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the mill has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program that helps manage risks at the mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (\"the RMP rule\").  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan describing the risk management program at the Ticonderoga mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the Risk Management Plan requirement of the RMP rule (68.150 through 68.195) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Sylvamo Ticonderoga mill.\n\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nThe Ticonderoga mill is committed to the safety of its employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, the mill controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n1.2  The Sylvamo Ticonderoga Mill and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Sylvamo Ticonderoga mill is a pulp and paper facility with bleaching operations.  The mill also operates a wastewater treatment facility and landfill.  The mill handles one substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the rule:\n\n\n\n    Process          "

The aqueous ammonia feed equipment has been dismantled and the storage of aqueous ammonia at the mill also ended on July 11, 2011. The storage tank formerly used for aqueous ammonia has been converted to store 50% sodium hydroxide (not regulated by the RMP Rule).\n\n\n\nThe use  of chlorine, previously referenced in the June 2009 Risk Management Plan, was permanently discontinued at the mill on October 21, 2010. The chlorine process equipment has been dismantled and the storage of chlorine at the mill also ended on October 21, 2010.\n\n\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by the Ticonderoga mill.  These requirements are:\n\n\n\n-one worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process (there is currently no Program 1 process at the facility);\n\n-one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 2 and Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing chlorine dioxide); and\n\n-one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 2 or Program 3 process (i.e.,chlorine dioxide).\n\n\n\nThese scenarios have been submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency as required.\n\n\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires a Program 3 Prevention Program for the pulp bleaching/chlorine dioxide process. The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at the Ticonderoga mill that apply to this process.\n\n\n\nSafety information.  The mill maintains a variety of technical docum"

Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the mill, including regulated substances in covered processes.  \n\n\n\nHazard review.  The mill performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure that the mill operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures.  The mill develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n\n\nTraining.  The mill trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.  \n\n\n\nMaintenance.  The mill properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\n\n\nManagement of change.  The mill's management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other cha"

The mill performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  \n\nThis review confirms that:\n\n\n\nconstruction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications;\n\nadequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place;\n\nemployee training has been completed; and\n\nfor a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified. \n\n\n\nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit.  The mill audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of mill operations.  The mill assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation. The mill investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  The mill trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, an"

The mill developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of employees are addressed.  The mill encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program. \n\n\n\nHot Work Permits.  The mill has established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes.  The mill reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The On-Duty Fire Safety Designee reviews the completed form before work can begin. In addition, a person is designated as \"Fire Watch\" while work is performed to monitor for potential fire and safety hazards and take action if necessary.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit form is included in the mill's safe work practices orientation.\n\n\n\nContractors.  The mill has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the facility are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety records of all contractors to help ensure that the mill only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The mill explains to the contractor supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the mill's safe work practices, and the mill's emergency response procedures.  The mill requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the mill before that"

Chlorine dioxide is produced at the mill and stored as dilute aqueous solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generators and piped to an absorber column, where up to a 1.2 wt% chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A diked area around the two storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release. \n\n\n\n1.5  Five-Year Accident History      \n\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n1.6  Emergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nThe mill has established a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials.  Regular dialogue is maintained between the mill and  local emergency response personnel, and the mill provides appropriate information to these organizations.  The mill periodically conducts emergency response drills.\n\n\n\n1.7  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSylvamo has an ongoing effort to take its safety performance to the next level to eliminate serious life-changing injuries and fatalities that occur in the workplace. This involves not only recommitting to all of the good safety practices that are in place, but drilling down to the sources of most serious injuries to figure out how to prevent them in a sustainable way. Sylvamo calls this the LIFE effort. In addition the mill has implemented Stop Work Authority, which empowers any employee, contractor or visitor to stop a job and review safety or environmental concerns without fear of reprisal.  "
