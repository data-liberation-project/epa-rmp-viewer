The facility was designed and constructed and is operated in compliance with the requirements of National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)-58 \"Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code,\" United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) 49 CFR 174 \"Carriage by Rail,\" and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws. Dead River maintains a First Response Vehicle at its Hampden, ME location that is for use at any location during emergencies, however because of the distance from that location Dead River has worked with the Presque Isle Fire Department so that they can assist in emergency response. Dead River has an outreach program to offer propane training during the summer months and instructional training to local fire departments for the purpose of educating fire departments about the hazards of propane.\r\nThe Presque Isle facility is a rail-access bulk terminal storing propane (LPG) for resale to retail propane outlets. The facility consists of three 45,000-gallon tanks with a total storage capacity of 114,750 gallons at maximum fill level (85%) as well as 3 railcars (30,000 gallons each) that can be attached to the unloading system for a total propane capacity of 191,250 gallons. \r\nThe worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a 45,000-gallon resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.4 miles, and there are approximately 107 people in residences within this distance. The alternative release scenario is a break in a 3\" diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.1 miles with 0 people in residences within this distance.\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.

Protective measures include but are not limited to emergency valves on all inlet and outlet piping, breakaway fittings at all cargo truck loading areas, emergency relief valves, impact protection measures for all loading and unloading areas, and lighting and fencing for security.   \r\nDead River has never had an accident involving propane that caused or might have caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelters-in-place.  In the event of an emergency involving the propane facilities described herein, it is Dead River's policy to notify the Presque Isle Fire Department to coordinate an emergency response.  Dead River will also utilize its in-house trained fire brigade.  Dead River maintains a First Response Vehicle at its Hampden, ME location that is available for use at any location during emergencies.  For major emergency response, Dead River has agreements with private emergency response contractors to provide these resources when and where needed on a 24-hour basis.  \r\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities is organized into 9 Sections.  Since this facility only has flammable chemicals and no toxic chemicals covered under 40 CFR 68, and because it is a Program 3 Propane Storage facility with no history of accidents, several of the sections do not apply.  The table below shows the equivalency between the organization of the guidance document and the Dead River RMP."
