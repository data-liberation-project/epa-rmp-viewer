This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Laredo Petroleum's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas compression of wellhead gas provides gas lift to remove liquids from the wellbore. Gas is gathered from the surrounding wells, sent to the Area 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station for the purpose of compressing the gas.  The high pressure gas is sent back to the wells for the purpose of removing liquids from the wellbore.  \n\n\n\nThe process of the compression and dehydration of natural gas and removal of condensate and natural gas liquids occurs in the following way.\n\n\n\nNatural gas from nearby wells is gathered into pipes that extend out into the field in a spider web configuration. The gas then enters the SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station.  Oil and water are separated out and sent to 300 bbl produced water and condensate fixed roof atmospheric storage tanks.   The oil is then trucked offsite following custody transfer.  The produced water is sent to a nearby injection well for disposal.  From the separator the gas is measured through orifice meters prior to being compressed.  After the gas is compressed, it is dried in a glycol dehydrator to remove entrained water. The main stream of gas leaving the glycol dehydrator enters the high pressure pipeline where it is re-distributed back to the wells for the purpose of gas lift. The liquids from the compre"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating in safety training and E.R.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLaredo Petroleum keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the local offices.

New operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nArea 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The Hon. Larry Isom is the contact for the LEPC (325/884-2665). Area 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station has around-the-clock communications capability.  Laredo Petroleum operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  Laredo Petroleum conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and Area 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to Laredo Petroleum personnel, there was 1 minor reportable incident that occurred on May 19, 2017. Details regarding the incident are as follows:  A nipple on the third-stage discharge bottle of a compressor located at the SRH-9/aa Compressor Station failed causing the release of a stream of gas which was ignited by heat from the engine. The unit was shut down and the fire was quickly extinguished by a crew on site with hand held fire extinguishers. The fire department was not notified and there was no need for a response. There was minor damage noted to the equipment. There were no deaths nor injuries as a result of this incident. Furthermore, no crude oil was consumed in the fire or released to the environment. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nLaredo Petroleum, owner and operator of Area 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.
