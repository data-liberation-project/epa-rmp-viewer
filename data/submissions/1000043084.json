By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Motiva Enterprises LLC - Apex Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Apex Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane.  Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel.  Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel).  The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack.  Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid and auto-analyzer.  Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and HMI, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices.  Access to the Apex Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\r\n\r\nMotiva's accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs allow affective management of the hazards posed by Butane to our employees, the public, and the environment.
