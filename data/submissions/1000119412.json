Executive Summary\nRisk Management Plan\nEPA Identifier:  1000 0018 4506\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\nThe Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nEnterprise's Hydrocarbon Terminal Facility is used to offload and load various LPG streams.  Off loaded products include propane, propylene and butanes.  These LPG products are imported from ships and barges. The products are then pumped into pipelines for distribution. Loaded products at the marine facility include propane, butane, isobutane, and propylene.  Dehydration is carried out in solid desiccant dehydrators to remove trace amounts water from the propane, butane, and isobutane products so that this water will not freeze when the product is refrigerated prior to loading.  The dehydrators use vaporized LPG for regeneration. This LPG is condensed, coalesced and treated with potassium hydroxide to remove water and any trace sulfur compounds before being returned to the dehydrator inlet.  The dehydrators have pre- and post-filtering of the product being loaded.  Following dehydration, the products are refrigerated to low temperatures to allow for the transport of the LPG's in atmospheric pressure tanks on ships and in barges.\n\nFor butane and isobutane loading, dried product is passed through refrigeration chillers and cooled to about 50 degrees F.  When loading p"

Propylene is cooled to -35F before loading.\n\nFlammables\n\nListed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal are a propane, butane, isobutane, and propylene.  The facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.\n\nToxics\n\nCurrently, there are no toxic substances used, manufactured, or stored at the facility that meet the RMP threshold quantities promulgated for those substances.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 3), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"\"near-miss\"\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all a"

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed."

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.\n\nThe procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\n\nContractors\n\nEnterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.

      "SummaryText": "a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nEnterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal uses an Enterprise software-based change approval system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented to ensure that the safety of the facility is not compromised by the change. Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEnterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident pr"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nEnterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire detection system and alarms\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n* A fire water and fire monitor system\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nEnterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and pub"

The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal is coordinated with the North Channel Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The facility emergency plan is also coordinated with the Oil Tanking Terminal, Inc. and the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (C.I.M.A.) group, which includes the Coast Guard, City of Houston Fire Department, and the Harris County Sherriff Department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal facility conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nEnterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Enterprise Hydrocarbon Terminal. \n\n* Installation of a surge relief system for dock lines."
