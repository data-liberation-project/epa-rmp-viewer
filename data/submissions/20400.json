To evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of two tank cars, 360,000 lb., of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from a pipe leak on the ammonia storage tanks in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 50 lb. of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 317 feet (0.06 mile).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for bromine involves a release from a pipe leak on the bromine storage tanks in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 10 lb. of bromine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L of bromine is 580 feet (0.11 miles).\n\nThe alte"

This commitment is demonstrated in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We  also coordinate with Union County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include ammonia, bromine, chlorine, phosgene [carbonic dichloride], and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.   Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization.  Bromine is used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] is used for chemical synthesis.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for  bromine recovery and scavenging.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of bromine at our facility is 2,669,666 lb. while chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] are present at our facility in quantities of 360,000 lb., 162,938 lb., 51,000 lb. and 4,000 lb. respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each repo"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Great Lakes Chemical, El Dorado Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nGreat Lakes Chemical, El Dorado Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, we have had no RMP reportable accidental releases during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nGreat Lakes Chemical, El Dorado Plant has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Additionally, annual drills are performed and critiqued. \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nGreat Lakes Chemical co-ordinates this emergency plan with the Union County, Arkansas Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes the computer based telephone emergency notification/calling system (Dialogic Communicator) operated by the 9-1-1 center.  The system can be used to both notify and advise the public and to call up emergency responders.  LEPC emergency plans include the community protection procedures known as Shelter-In-Place.\n\n7.\tPlanned Change"
