Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules, regulations, and requirements.  Safety depends upon the manner which we handle these products combined with the safety devices, policies, and procedures and good engineering design and practices in the operation of the process.  These include proactive safety programs such as our Basic Safety Process and implementation of American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Codes of Management Practices.  \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance:\n\nThe stationary source contains the following regulated substances above the EPA RMP TQ:  Arsine, Phosphorus Oxychloride and Titanium Tetrachloride.  Arsine is manufactured under vacuum using a chemical reaction to generate the gas.  The aggregate storage of this product makes RMP applicable.  Phosphorus Oxychloride is purified using distillation technology.   The aggregate storage quantity of material makes this product RMP applicable.  Titanium Tetrachloride is purified using distillation technology.  The aggregate storage quantity makes this product RMP applicable.\n\n3. Clarifications to the Alternate Case Scenario for Arsine include: Quantity released is less than one pound (0.2 pounds). The EPA default value is one pound.  Rate of release is less than 0.1 pound/minute (0.02 pounds/minute). The miniumum EPA value is 0.1 pounds per minute.\n\n4. The general accident release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan and the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  In addition, the facility implements the ACC Responsible Care Codes of Management practices and complies with all applicable federal, state, and and local regulatory requirements.  In addition, the company has voluntarily invested in emission scrubbing technology that is not mandated by"

The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility complies with all EPA, OSHA, and Compressed Gas Association (CGA)requirements for emergency response.  There are emergency programs and plans specific to the facility and surrounding industry.  Local emergency responders have visited the facility and are familiar with site operations response capabilities. \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility strives toward continuous improvement in regards to EH&S and good engineering practices and design.  The facility implements the ACC Responsible Care codes of management practices.  In addition, Air Products and Chemicals has implemented EH&S Global standards and best practices that often exceed regulatory standards."
