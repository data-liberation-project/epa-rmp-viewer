      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary: GME Trenton Facility\n\nThe Trenton Oil Facility Overview and RMP Regulated Substance\n\nThe Grayson Mill Energy Trenton Oil Facility (Facility), is an oil blending Facility that primarily utilizes three product feedstocks:\nCrude Oil: Crude oil is brought to the Facility via incoming pipelines and truck-in operations. The crude oil is then stored in the onsite storage tanks. \nHeavy Crude Oil: Heavy crude oil will be trucked into a newly constructed tank farm. \nButane: The Butane will be trucked to the site and loaded into two (2) 90,000 USG low-pressure (LP) storage bullets.\n\nThe Facility was recently expanded to include storage for Heavy Oil and Butane as well as the equipment required to blend the Heavy Oil, Butane, and existing Crude Oil together. A list of major equipment located onsite can be seen below. \n\u0095\tTwo (2) Heavy Oil Storage Tanks\n\u0095\tTwo (2) 90,000 USG Low Pressure (LP) Butane Storage Bullets\n\u0095\tOne (1) Blending Skid \n\u0095\tTwo (2) Heavy Oil Offloading Stations \n\u0095\tTwo (2) Butane Offloading Stations \n\u0095\tTwo (2) Heavy Oil Blend Pumps \n\u0095\tTwo (2) Butane Blend Pumps \n\u0095\tTwo (2) Crude Oil Booster Pumps\n\u0095\tTwo (2) 1000 USG Propane Bullets\n\nA brief overview of the Facility process is as follows. Heavy oil is pumped to the blending skid where it is blended with crude oil. The heavy oil and crude oil blend passes through a static mixer before it is blended with Butane. The Butane blended product will then pass through a second static mixer before being measured by a vapor pressure analyzer. The newly blended product will be directed to the mainline pump for transfer to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) or Enbridge.\n\nThe regulated substance at the Trenton Oil Facility is Butane. The process in which the Butane is utilized is Butane Blending with the crude oil blend prior to being directed to DAPL or Enbridge. The Butane will be stored at the Facility in two (2) 90,000 USG bullets. Butane will be trucked in and loaded into the Butane bullets via two (2) Butan"

Contained in the ERP are instructions for operators of the Facility to follow should an emergency occur. The Emergency Response Plan contains procedures for the detection, notification, and activation of the site-specific ERP. If required, external agencies can be contacted via the phone numbers provided in the ERP. There are also Defined Situations of Hazards and Accidents (DSHA\u0092s) action plans to assist Grayson Mill Energy responders in responding to emergencies at the Facility. The Grayson Mill Energy operations team in North Dakota also conducts Emergency Response Plan drills and exercises, which allow them to practice responding to tangible emergencies should they occur. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe recent addition of the Butane Bullets to the Trenton Oil Facility required updates to the operations instruction manuals as well as the site\u0092s maintenance processes. In addition to the updates to existing instruction manuals and maintenance processes, the operations team at the Trenton Oil Facility will also be trained on the new processes required to operate the site. The facility\u0092s site-specific ERP will also be updated to include response procedures should an emergency occur which affects the regulated substance, Butane.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe Trenton Oil Facility has not had any accidental releases of crude oil or other products in the past five years.\n\nGrayson Mill Energy Emergency Response Program\nAs mentioned previously, the Trenton Oil Facility has a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP has been updated to include information and response actions specific to the addition of the Butane Bullets to the Facility site. The ERP also contains actions specific to how the response team (ICS) will be activated as well as how members of the public will ge"
