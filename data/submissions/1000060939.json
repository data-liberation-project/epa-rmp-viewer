This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC, (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal located in Apache County, Arizona is owned by Enterprise\n\nProducts Operating LLC, and is operated by Enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal facility is a bulk hydrocarbon storage and handling facility. The facility receives propane, butane; pentane and mixed refinery grade butane (RGB) liquids either by rail car or transport truck and stores these liquids in one of ten active underground storage caverns. These liquids are stored until needed and are then shipped back out of the facility to wholesale customers.  Normal butane is shipped out exclusively by railcar. The other liquid products stored at Adamana are shipped out either by railcar or transport truck. A number of surge tanks are on site at the facility to receive products prior to subsequent pumping into the storage caverns. A solid bed propane dehydrator is used to provide dehydration for stored propane product prior to truck or railcar loading.  An iso-butane / normal butane splitter unit is also available for on-site fractionation of refinery grade butane (RGB) products on a batch basis.  The fractionation facility is currently isolated and shut down.    Should "

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on the known volumes of the storage caverns and rail car loading and unloading rack.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Adamana Storage and Terminal facility are propane, normal butane, pentane and the mixed refinery grade butane.  The Storage and Terminal facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program being put in place at the Adamana Storage and Terminal.  The storage and loading operations at the Storage and Terminal facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system being put into place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Storage and Terminal facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic release"

Employee involvement helps to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\n\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs. Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Storage and Terminal facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the causal factors, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Storage and Terminal facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved and comple"
