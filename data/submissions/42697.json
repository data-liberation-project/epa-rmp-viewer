Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 13 states.  Fifteen processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest US grain companies.  In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, and livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nThe Perdue Farms Salisbury facility is located in Wicomico County, Maryland, in the town of Salisbury.  The facility is a poultry processing plant which employs approximately 644 associates to receive broiler and cornish meat plus other raw ingredients to form and prepare for distribution to the market place.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 5 days per week.\n\nThe regulated substance at the Salisbury facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as integral part of its refrigeration system, which consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the processing plant in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total system capacity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 49,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components, although the normal operating inventory maintained is approximately 23,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minim"

Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Director of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health, and safety training to the its staff.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\nThe Perdue Farms Salisbury facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components.  As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance, as needed.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nPerdue's Salisbury facility has one accident within the last five years on September 17, 2002, involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nIn the event of an emergency involving our refrigeration system, Perdue's Salisbury facility has a well defined incident command system.  The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials.

In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civil groups, media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nAs part of Perdue Farms\u00bf continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Salisbury facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality."
