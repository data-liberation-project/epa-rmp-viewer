All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Detrex has a strict policy of informaing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.                                                                                                                                                                              5.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, mainenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible relases of regulated substances.                                                                                                                                                       2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.  Our facility's primary activities encompass semi-conductor grade hydrochloric acid, zinc dialkyldithiophosphates, and n-methyl pyrrole.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are chlorine, hydrochloric acid at 37%, and furan.  Chlorine is used for making hydrochloric acid.  Hyrdrochloric acid is used for strictly to ship as a finished product to customers.  Furan is used for n-methyl pyrrole production.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 540,000 pounds, hydrochloric acid maximum inventory is 800,000 pounds, and furan has a maximum inventory of 40,000 pounds.                                                                                                         3.  The worst case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequences analyses for our facility, we have used EPA's RMP Comply.  The following provides details of the chosen scenarios.                                        The worst case release scenario submitted for program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic relase of chlorine storage and handling system."

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including outside agencies, when necessary, to provide first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, and the public, as well as post incident contamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inpsected and serviced.
