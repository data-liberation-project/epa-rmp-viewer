Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n7 General facility and regulated substances information.\n7 Offsite consequence analysis results.\n7 Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n7 Five-year accident history summary.\n7 Emergency response program summary.\n7 Planned changes to improve safety.\nThe above information for the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and prov"

The Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\nThe Tujunga Wells Chlorination Facility is located at 8801 Arleta Avenue in Sun Valley, California.  The facility is located approximately one-quarter mile east of the Hollywood Freeway (State 170) and immediately south of the Tujunga Wash River. This facility is a groundwater well field and pumping station complex.  The facility injects chlorine into a collector pipeline before entering or after leaving a 3-million gallon water contact tank. The station consists of a chlorine storage room, a chlorination room, a chlorine control room, a chemical feed\\tool room, and a chlorine scrubber. The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. A maximum of nine one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the Tujunga Wells chlorine building.  Six of these containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas and the other three containers are stored as spares.  The one-ton"

The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Tujunga Wells facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\nIn normal operation, four 1-ton chlorine containers are manifolded in two banks of two containers to supply chlorine.  These four containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  The facility has existing connections, without Halogen actuators, for one additional ton container to connect to each of the two banks. These two container connections have automatic shutoff valves in the piping system immediately downstream of the pigtail connections. These six containers rest on load cell scales, which allows the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in the containers.  There is also space for the storage of three additional ton chlorine containers, which can be used as spares, but are rarely used. \nChlorine gas is withdrawn from a bank of containers through pigtails which are attached to the ton container gas valves.  The chlorine flows under pressure to a chlorine header to the pressure-sensitive automatic switch-over valves.  The switch-over valves are triggered by the rise in vacuum pressure in the chlorine feed line between the switch-over valve and the chlorinator.  The rise in vacuum occurs when the chlorine container pressure approaches zero, which happens when the container is empty.  If this occurs, the switch-over"

The chlorine gas then leaves the switch-over valve under vacuum to the chlorinators in the adjacent room.  From the chlorinators, the gaseous chlorine then travels under vacuum to three chlorine injectors in an underground vault outside the station.  At the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high pressure water supply to form a chlorine solution, which then travels to diffuser tubes located in the pipelines.\nResidual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine downstream of the diffusers and provide feedback control for subsequent chlorine dosing.\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors have been installed inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar. \nThe Tujunga Wells site has also installed a caustic solution scrubber actuated by the chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm that can neutralize up to 2,000 lb of chlorine. \nThe scrubber system is powered by imported electricity or by the backup generator during power outages. All other chlorine alarms, communication systems, mitigation devices, and facility controls have backup power supplies or batteries that would allow them to operate if normal electrical power was interrupted. \nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily.  A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest ve"

The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station involves a failure of the one-ton container and release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine to the atmosphere over a 10-minute duration, regardless of how improbable this may be.  The chlorine release rate to the atmosphere was defined to be 200 lbs./min. No passive mitigation systems were considered in determining the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere.\nEPA and CalARP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.  Since the chlorine cloud formed during the worst-case release scenario would be denser-than-air, the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) model was used for performing the air dispersion modeling analysis.\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (1060F), and average humidity (61%) were used for the dispersion modeling analysis.

Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the hazard review.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the hazard review, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \nThe scenario selected for the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station chlorination system involves the release of chlorine gas from a crack in one of the pigtails connecting a third container in a bank to the gas header.  The third container in each bank is not equipped with the Halogen actuator and a leak in one pigtail will allow the 1-ton containers to leak.  It is assumed that the crack developed in < inch diameter pigtail corresponds to a hole of 0.0625-inch (1/16-inch) diameter. The control room would have been warned of the chlorine leak by the chlorine monitors installed at the chlorination facility at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.  At a concentration of 3 ppm, the scrubber is automatically activated at the facility.  At a concentration of 10 ppm, the Halogen actuators"

No passive mitigation systems were considered.  Two active mitigation systems considered are the actuation of a chlorine detector and the operation of the scrubber.\nThe chlorine release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 0.6 lb/min (EPA, 1998b).  However, the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.003 lb/min.  Based on the chlorine release rate of 0.6 lb/min (EPA, 1998b) and the release duration of 60 minutes, the total quantity of chlorine released inside the storage room was estimated at 36 lb for the alternative release scenario. \nEPA's SCREEN 3, a steady state screening model, was used for the selected alternative release scenario.  The results obtained using this model are expected to be conservative (higher concentrations).  SCREEN3 is a Gaussian dispersion model applicable to continuous releases of non-reactive, non-dense gases that are emitted from point or area sources (EPA, 1998a). The user may predict a conservative worst-case result based on a pre-selected range of worst-case meteorological combinations or may select individual wind speed and stability categories for analysis.  The wind speed and stability class combinations considered in the SCREEN3 model for the alternative analysis is the EPA recommended default combination of wind speed of 3 m/s and atmospheric stability of D.  The SCREEN3 model predicts one-hour average concentrations for the modeled pollutants.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3ppm.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the alternative release scenario has no offsite impacts. \nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station during"

The hazard review was further reviewed in April 1999 and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions was developed in April 1999 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of the recommended actions.\nA seismic walkthrough was recently completed based on the 1997 UBC LEPC Region 1 guidance document, and recommendations were provided to DWP staff for their evaluation and implementation. \n\nOperating Procedures\nDWP has prepared written operating procedures for Tujunga Wells chlorination facility that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to chlorination process. They are consistent with the chlorine safety information.   Written operating procedures included in the facility's Operation and Maintenance Manual for Chlorination Stations include:\n7 Delivery of Chemicals\n7 Container Connections\n7 Pre-Start\n7 Start\n7 Normal Operations\n7 Shutdown, and\n7 Operating Problems and Remedies.\n\nTraining \n The DWP ensures that each employee operating or maintaining the chlorination process, and each employee newly assigned to this process, is trained and tested for competency in the operating procedures listed above. The DWP employee training documentation files include training records for each employee assigned to operate or maintain the chlorination process.  The training ensures that the employee has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine emergency response, as provided in the operating procedures.  Employee training includes as a minimum the following elements:\n7 Safety Information;\n7 Process Technology and Process Equipmen"

In addition, DWP ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after major modifications.\n\nMaintenance \nThe DWP operates a Mainsaver Program that generates a task order for performance of the preventive maintenance routine after a designated time past the closing of the previous task order for that maintenance.  Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order.  The water treatment supervisor is responsible for this task.  \nIn addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the General Operation and Maintenance Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance checklists are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, monthly, biannual, annual, every 2 to 10 years, and as-needed basis.  These allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary, and provide supervisors with a brief log of maintenance history at the chlorination station.  The schedules are supplemental to the log sheets on-site and provide a summary and quick reference to manufacturer's O&M manuals. \n DWP documents inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorination equipment and assures the performance is done in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer and industry groups (i.e., Chlorine Institute).\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n The DWP will certify every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Program 2 Prevention Program requirements are met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.\nThe compliance audit will consist of separating the"
