The facility is also supported by a Safety Program Manager and Environmental Program Manager at the Water Services Division level. The City of Glendale has developed PSM/RMP program purpose, scope and requirements documents addressing all program elements required under the PSM/RMP regulations.\n \nThe City of Glendale has designated its water treatment plants as \u0093non-responding facilities;\u0094 thus, its employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances. The Water Facility Supervisor, with assistance from the Water Treatment Superintendent and Environmental Program Manager, is responsible for the annual review and update of the facility Emergency Response Plan (ERP). This includes conducting the annual coordination activities, annual notification drills, and establishing appropriate schedules and plans for field and tabletop exercises with outside emergency responders. The Environmental Program Manager is responsible for submittal of the ERP to the Arizona State Emergency Response Commission (AZSERC) as part of the City\u0092s obligations under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n\n(b) The stationary source and r"

The facility is a conventional treatment plant that treats water to potable use and the facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMP), 40 CFR 68. The covered process contains chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5), which is injected into the finished water for disinfection; the chlorine system is designed to provide continuous chlorine residual for potable water disinfection. \n\nChlorine storage and supply (chlorine feed system) are located within a dedicated building designed to contain a chlorine release and equipped with chlorine gas detection, automatic flow shutoff valves, and an emergency chlorine scrubber. The chlorine disinfection system is supplied by one-ton chlorine containers (tonners) interconnected in \u0093banks\u0094 of containers; when in operation, there is an \u0093on-line\u0094 bank and a \u0093stand-by\u0094 bank. The facility may also have 150-pound chlorine cylinders in storage for use at remote facilities.\n \n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n \nThe facility is a Program Level 3 facility and has developed program elements addressing the fourteen (14) program elements under OSHA PSM and the equivalent requirements under EPA RMP. The chlorine building is a secured area within a secured site; all access doors to the chlorine building are secured with access controls.\n\nThe chlorine building is an enclosed building designed to contain a worst-case chlorine gas release; the building is connected to an emergency chlorine scrubber with 1-ton capacity that is automatically activated upon chlorine gas leak detection (it may also be manually activated). In addition to activating the emergency scrubber for the chlorine building, chlorine g"

The emergency scrubber will shut off upon detection of chlorine at the scrubber discharge, which is an indication the scrubber capacity has been exceeded; residual chlorine is contained within the building designed for this purpose.\n \nThe chlorine containers connected to the feed system \u0093banks\u0094 are equipped with motorized Emergency Shutdown Devices connected directly to the container. The motorized control valves are remotely shutdown in an emergency, either manually or shutdown initiated automatically upon detection of a chlorine leak. The only pressurized source of chorine in the process is within the supply container and the small volume of piping between the container and control valve, and the vacuum regulating valve, which is connected directly immediately downstream of the motorized Emergency Shutdown Device. Flow out of the vacuum regulating valve to the downstream feed system (chlorinators and injection points) is continually under vacuum created by eductors at the finished water injection points. \n \nThere is a multi-layer system in place to mitigate the extent of chlorine release from the process: (1) properly trained operators to safely handle chlorine and to operate and maintain the process equipment; (2) chlorine leak detectors located where chlorine is stored and/or used; (3) fail-safe equipment, design and installation of back-up safety equipment including emergency chlorine scrubber; and (4) an automated warning system that notifies both on-site and off-site personnel of a potential release. \n\n(d) The five-year accident history;\n \nThe facility has had no accidents meeting the EPA criteria requiring reporting under the five-year accident history. \n\n(e) The emergency response program;\n \nThe City of Glendale has developed and implemented an Emergency Planning and Response Program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.

The written ERP is based on the Arizona State Emergency Response Commissions\u0092 EPCRA Facility Emergency Response Plan template that complies with other Federal contingency plan regulations consistent with the approach in the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\u0093One Plan\u0094). The EPCRA ERP has been amended to address the additional ERP elements under EPA RMP, such as documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures (\u00a768.95(a)(1)(ii)) and training for all employees in relevant procedures (\u00a768.95(a)(3)).\n  \nThe ERP for each facility is reviewed and updated at least annually, or more frequently due to changes at the facility or new information obtained from coordination activities, emergency response exercises, incident investigations, or other available information, and ensure that employees are informed of the changes.\n\nThe facility conducts and documents annual coordination activities and annual notification drills. As a non-responding facility, annual coordination includes consulting with local emergency response officials to establish appropriate schedules and plans for field and tabletop exercises; this requires that the facility request an opportunity to meet with the LEPC (or equivalent) and/or local fire department as appropriate to review and discuss those plans and schedule exercises. \n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe facility has recently completed revision of all PSM/RMP program documents and is in the process of electronically compiling all process safety information and records into an electronic filing system."
