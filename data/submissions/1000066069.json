(PCS) facility is located on Highway 3115 between Highway 75 and 30 in Geismar, Louisiana. The facility manufactures liquid Phosphate and Nitrogen based fertilizers and industrial grade Nitric Acid, Ammonium Nitrate (liquid only) and Phosphoric Acid. The Applicable NAICS codes are 325311 and 325312. The regulated substances on site that are above the threshold quantity are ammonia, oleum and a flammable gas mixture (Ammonia Process - Primarily Hydrogen and Natural Gas). The Geismar Complex is subject to the requirements of Program 3 as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.12 due to the applicability of the NAICS code. The facility is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) (ARS), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario, have been performed for all the listed toxic chemicals at the facility. The EPA RMP Comp program was used to perform the offsite consequence analysis for the facility for the ammonia releases and the STAWaRS model was used for the oleum releases. The reported worst-case scenarios are the toxic chemicals that could result in the release of the largest quantity of chemical and has the greatest distance to the endpoint. An ARS was reported for each substance above the regulated threshold. The scenarios were modeled for releases that are more probable than the worst-case scenario. \n\n\n\nPREVENTION"

Depending upon the complexity of the process system being analyzed, a variety of methodologies can be used. PCS Nitrogen chose the \"HAZOP\" (Hazard and Operability Study) and \"What if\" processes. PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances. The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product. The operating procedures give detailed step by step operating instructions for each part of the process during: 1) Initial startup, 2) Normal operation, 3) Temporary operation, 4) Emergency shutdown, 5) Emergency operation, 6) Normal shutdown, and 7) Start-up following turnaround or emergency shutdown.\n\n\n\nTraining Plan\n\n\n\nPCS has developed a training plan that provides a guide for the training of each employee in job related and job specific responsibilities.

The audits are directed by both a Corporate Process Safety Assessment Procedure and an Internal Process Safety Assessment Procedure. Each audit is performed by a team that is knowledgeable of the process.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAlthough PCS Nitrogen has a stringent release prevention policy, there have been three incidents within a covered processes at the facility within the past 5 years. These are as follows:\n\n\n\n1.    On February 14, 2013, at approximately 7:45 PM operators were in the process of starting up the Urea Plant when an Aldrich Pump seal failed resulting in the release of 1,608 lbs of ammonia gas.  Facility personnel sheltered in place. Two people were injured with one person requiring hospitalization with vision and breathing impairment. Release notifications were promptly made to all appropriate State and federal officials. Follow up written reports were submitted to the LDEQ, State Police, Ascension and Iberville Parish LEPCs and EPA Region VI. In response to this incident the Urea Plant start up procedures were modified as well as additional preventative measures were incorporated into maintenance procedures associated with the Urea Plant.

On January 20, 2016, at approximately 4:05 AM the emergency relief vent on the north ammonia storage tank lifted releasing ammonia vapor. After investigating, it was determined that the ammonia vapor discharge line was obstructed by an accumulation of oil, causing the tank to become pressurized. The blockage was upstream of the header to the ammonia vapor discharge compressors and the emergency flare associated with the ammonia storage tanks resulting in the relief valve lifting. Road blocks along 3115 in front of the plant were established as a precautionary measure. PCS personnel conducted monitoring along HWY 3115 between Gate C-1 and the Ammonia Plant Cooling Tower using Draeger&trade; tubes and a portable field meter. Initial results were from 30 to 40 ppm, but by 8:38 AM the ammonia levels had dropped to 15 ppm. After 9 AM the ammonia levels were from 0 to 5 ppm in this same area.
