      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\nYUIMA MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT\nP.O. BOX 177\n34928 VALLEY CENTER ROAD\nPAUMA VALLEY, CA  92061\n\n\nSECTION 1:  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThis risk management plan addresses the risk management program for Yuima Municipal Water District, located in Pauma Valley, a rural agricultural area of Northern San Diego County.  This plan applies to the process conducted to store chlorine gas cylinders that are used to chlorinate the water supplies and distribution systems within the district.  Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 1990 Amendments requires a risk management plan and program be developed for regulated substances used above certain thresholds within a process that could lead to an accidental release.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements the Federal Clean Air Act by Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  In turn, Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations on Public Safety implements the Federal requirements with certain additions specific to the state.  The EPA has delegated its authority to the state and local regulatory agencies.  As such, the State of California has established threshold levels that are lower (more stringent) than the Federal thresholds.  Yuima Municipal Water District's inventory of chlorine gas [Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7782-50-5] cylinders stored at the District Storage Yard is above the Federal and State regulatory threshold.   \n\nThis plan is prepared in compliance with the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Materials Division, \"California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) Guidelines\" (revised February 25, 1999).   This plan shall be reviewed annually and updated at least every 5 years.  This plan is intended to describe the responsibilities and activities necessary to respond to an accidental release of chlorine gas to personnel, the public, and the environment.  This plan is made available to the public and the local emergency "

The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this district is 4941(water supply), and the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 221310 (water supply systems).\n\nYuima Municipal Water District has established a chlorine-handling procedure, emergency plan, and training program that ensures the safety of personnel, the public, and the environment.  This plan addresses emergency response and accident prevention.  The chlorine handling procedure covers the safety aspects of changing chlorine cylinders and storage.  The hazardous material training programs consist of hazard identification, proper handling of chlorine cylinders, safety precautions, use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), daily visual inspections, work orders, and corrective maintenance services.  The program also provides for training as first responders and hazardous material (HAZMAT) technician-level mitigation specialists.  The program implements the elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management standards.   A process hazard evaluation has been performed and will be updated at least once every five years or whenever there is a new hazard or risk created by changes at the District Storage Yard.  To this date, the District has never had a leak event happen.\n\nThe Yuima Municipal Water District was established in January 1963 under the Municipal Water District Act of 1911.  The water district was needed for the prime purpose of importing Colorado River water to the areas populated mostly within the mutual water companies existing in the Pauma Valley area, in order to augment their local water supplies.  The water companies include:\n\n    (  Palomar Mutual Water Company (later known as Improvement District A)\n    (  Rancho Estates Mutual Water Company (Adams Drive area)\n    (  Rancho Pauma Mutual Water Company (Pauma Valley Country Club area)\n    (  Lazy H Mutual Water Company (L"

Yuima takes its name from a creek tributary to the San Luis Rey River, which means \"Snow Water\" in the Native American language.\n\nThe Yuima Municipal Water District encompasses approximately 12,793 acres (19 square miles) that includes district-owned watershed lands, the famous Wilderness Gardens, and Indian Reservation lands (Yuima and Pauma Tribes).  The District is located in the Pauma Valley that has an estimated population of 1,800 residents (see Figure 1-1).  Many residents are transient grove workers and others are property owners that reside in Pauma Valley seasonally.  The District serves approximately 320 connections on a regular basis.  Some residents have their own private water supply or are supplied by the mutual water companies in Yuima Municipal Water District's boundaries and have stand-by connections in the event demand exceeds their pumping abilities or well failure.   The District contractually operates and maintains two private water companies: Lazy H Mutual Water Company with 32 connections and the Rancho Estates Mutual Water Company with 87 connections.\n\nThe District's boundaries are adjoined by Mootamai Municipal Water District, Pauma Municipal Water District, and Valley Center Municipal Water District to the west (see Figure 1-2).  Palomar Mountain State Park is 16 miles from the District, and the famous Wilderness Gardens is located in the District together with the renowned Pauma Valley Country Club.  The area is unique in many ways due to its varying elevations, private water companies and high rate of "

Average rainfall per year is approximately twenty-seven (27) inches.\n\nThe Yuima Municipal Water District is governed by a five (5) member board of directors representing a division of the District in which each member resides.  Regular meetings of the board of directors are held monthly.  The board elects its officers at its first meeting in January of each odd-numbered year.  The District utilizes outside consultants on a continuous, as needed basis for operational and environmental concerns.\n\nThe District headquarters is located on Valley Center Road and contains a storage depot (District Storage Yard).  Full one-ton (2,000 pound capacity) chlorine gas cylinders are routinely delivered to the District Storage Yard by an offsite chemical supplier, that varies based on economic value and costs.  The one-ton cylinders are transported using a sling-tank trailer (attached to a truck or tow vehicle) to eight (8) chlorine injection sites (see Figure 1-3).   The chlorine injection sites are identical in layout and function.  These sites include:  McNally tanks, Reservoirs 6 and 8, Dunlap Reservoir, Barrett Reservoir, Schoepe well field, Rancho Estates Mutual Water Company Lower and Upper Reservoirs.  Each of these sites has a single one-ton chlorine gas cylinder that exceeds the State threshold quantity.  A separate Risk Management Plan will be prepared to address these sites, as agreed upon by the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Materials Division.   Figure 1-4 shows the District Storage Yard layout.\n\nWhen the cylinders are empty, District personnel pick up the cylinders and replace the empty ones with full ones from the District Storage Yard.  The empty cylinders are stored temporarily at the District Storage Yard and picked up by the offsite chemical supplier in exchange for new full cylinders.  Administrative controls are in place to ensure safe storage and transport.   No more than five (5) full one-ton cylinders and ten (1"

Usage rates vary from one month to several months, up to one year for each station.  Turn-around time never exceeds one year for each injection site.  \n\nAn offsite-consequence analysis, using the worst-case scenario for an accidental release of chlorine gas is provided in Section 4 of this plan, as required by the RMP Guidelines.  The worst-case scenario consists of failure of a full one-ton chlorine gas cylinder and 150-pound chlorine gas cylinder, releasing chlorine gas at ground level over a ten (10) minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter is 3 miles for the one-ton cylinder and 0.8 miles for the 150-pound cylinder.  This release is based on worst-case weather conditions, outdoor operations, and is the distance at which chlorine gas no longer poses a hazard to the public.  The worst-case release scenario is modeled using the methodology identified in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \"Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants\", EPA 550-B-98-010.    The chlorine gas cylinders are designed to withstand a 45 miles per hour (mph) impact.  Administrative controls are in place to limit the transportation speed during delivery to and from the District Storage Yard to 45 mph or less.  Also, an alternate scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario is provided in this section.   The alternate release scenario consists of a punctured hole or small leak on a full chlorine gas cylinder.  The alternate release scenario is modeled using the EPA air dispersion model T-SCREEN( (Version 3.0, Britter-McQuaid model, 1992).   The distance to the toxic endpoint is 3 miles for the one-ton cylinder and 0.8 miles for the 150-pound cylinder. \n\nAdministrative controls and procedures are in place to quickly identify"

Proper chlorine gas handling procedures are in place to ensure safe handling, loading and off-loading by operations personnel.   A chlorine emergency repair kit is used to contain any valve leaks detected during normal operations.  Employee training and HAZMAT personal protective equipment are available and are used to safely repair this kind of problem.  Work orders are prepared by personnel to ensure that safety equipment maintenance and repair are properly completed in a timely manner.  An effective training program for employees and participation in simulated exercises or drills ensures management's commitment to general release prevention. \n\nThere have been no accidents or any offsite injuries as a result of a chlorine gas release within the past five(5) years of operation.   No \"hot work\" involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame/spark-producing operation is performed on the chlorine gas cylinders. Additional training on the Yuima Municipal Water District's risk management program is planned to improve the safety awareness of personnel.   Future efforts will be made to communicate the process, and the risks associated with the process, to appropriate public sectors and to install additional safety features (e.g., safety barns, bermed concrete slabs with seismic restraints, leak detectors, and alarm systems) to the process as the budget planning allows. Procedures for quality assurance regarding chlorine transportation from the District Storage Yard to the chlorine injection site and specific training on process safety management has been established.\n\n\n\n\n4"
