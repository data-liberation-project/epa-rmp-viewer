      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \n\nThe Rochelle Foods facility located in Rochelle, Illinois is a food processing facility.  The primary purpose of this facility is to further process meat and food products for distribution to retailers.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \n\nThe ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  Ammonia as contained in equipment in the facility is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since 1994 under the PSM standard. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditi"

We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \n\nThe Manager of Plant Engineering is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements: \n\n\u00bf Employee Participation Program: \nThe Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.   \n\u00bf Process Safety Information: \nAmmonia refrigeration equipment manuals and plant design technical specifications including piping diagrams are on file.  \n\u00bf Process Hazard Analysis: \nA process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in September 2019 and another PHA re-validation is scheduled for 2024.   A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control syst"

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  These SOPs were converted to the IIAR format in 2014.  \n\u00bf Training Program: \nAn operator training program is designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  \n\u00bf Contractor Safety Program: \nContractors that are used to work on or adjacent to the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\u00bf Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures: \nSee comments under Management of Change  \n\u00bf Mechanical Integrity Program: \nThe Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system.  \n\u00bf Hot Work Permit Procedures: \nThe plant has implemented a Hot Work permit program including training.  \n\u00bf Management of Change Procedures: \nFor projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\u00bf Incident Investigation Procedures: \nAn incident investigation program is in place at the plant to review incidents and implement any identified improvement(s) to reduce future potential for new incidents to occur.  \n\u00bf Compliance Audit Procedures: \nAt least every three years a full program audit is conducted.  \n\nD. Five-Year Accident History \n\nOn 7/17/2022 an operator was putting a newly replaced compressor back online. Th"

      "SummaryText": "e compressor had passed a vacuum leak check and the operator was cracking the suction valve to pressure test with ammonia. When he cracked the valve he got a breath of ammonia. He quickly closed the valve. It was open for less than 10 seconds. The stationary ammonia detectors in the room did not detect any ammonia. Several hours later the operator developed a productive cough and went to the hospital to be checked out. He was given a breathing treatment and released a few hours later. As a corrective action the SOP for recharging the system was updated.\n \nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program \n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials. \n\nThe emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Rochelle Fire Department and other agencies involved with response.  Representatives of the Rochelle Fire Department visit this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to respond to any ammonia release.  This trained staffs are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nIdentification of opportunities and changes to improve safety is part of the culture of this plant.  In addition to the plant programs mentioned above, the following changes are planned. \nRochelle Food has demonstrated th"
