This facility processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) from a producing well.  High pressure gas from the well is first routed to a high pressure separator located at another facility (permitted separately).  The subsequent gas is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in an 18,000 gallon pressureized bullet tank operating at approximately 150 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by tranfers to tank trucks.  \n\nThe facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  The facility has approximately 93,600 pounds of NGL on site.  The NGL products are a mixture of hydrocarons consisting of methane, ethane, propane, butane and isobutane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane).\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The operator is aware of the Generat Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations (see Section 1.4 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Program\" document) and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of the Risk Management Plan, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemente"
