You may want to include any corporate policies (if applicable) and an overview of senior management commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures.\n\nAt Formosa Plastics Corporation, Delaware we are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment to our employees.  In an effort to accomplish this goal the facility has implemented policies and procedures to ensure the safe operation of the facility. The facility has also developed an environmental management system and is certified to the ISO14001-2004 standard. \n\nFormosa Plastics DE has implemented a process safety program that includes:\nA?    Identification and development of process safety information\nA?     The development and implementation of a mechanical integrity program, which requires inspections and testing of affected equipment. \nA?    The training, certification, and continued recertification of employees who operate the regulated processes.\nA?    Routine third party compliance audits\nA?    Scheduled hazard analysis of all regulated processes\n\n\nAlso in order to maintain a high level of performance in the process safety program , all changes made to regulated processes must go through a thorough Management of Change review and approval procedure. This procedure requires that all changes whether to equipment, process parameters, procedures, or the chemicals used on site be reviewed for the changeA?s impact on all areas of process safety. \n\nAs a final step to ensuring the safety to our employees and to the surrounding community, routine compliance audits are conducted by the Safety Department, Environmental Department, Shift Supervisors and Hourly Employees.

Describe the primary activities at the facility (e.g., manufacturer of polyethylene, pulp mill, etc.) and the regulated substances used.  In addition, you may want to mention the quantities of these substances handled or stored at your facility.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe first sections of the Delaware City PVC plant were built in 1966 by Stauffer Chemical Co. The facility was acquired in 1981 by the Formosa Plastics Group.  The current plant property line covers 112 acres of which approximately 30 acres is leased as farmland.  The site employs 92 full-time employees.  The major components of the facility involve two PVC Polymerization units, two dryer units, an automatic bagging plant, waste water treatment plant, and the finished goods warehouse.  The plant production capability is 180 tons of PVC Resin per day. \n\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES:\n\nThe primary activities carried out at the facility involve polymerization of Vinyl Chloride and Vinyl Chloride / Vinyl Acetate Copolymers, drying of PolyVinyl Chloride, Packaging of PolyVinyl Chloride, Storage and Shipping of PolyVinyl Chloride, and treatment of process waste water.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nVinyl Chloride - Three 425,000 pound storage tanks\n\nVinyl Acetate - One 240,000 pound storage tank\n\nPRODUCTION PROCESS:\n\nThe facility production process involves con"

In order to produce PolyVinyl Chloride, vinyl chloride is received from rail car and unloaded into storage tanks.  From the storage tanks the vinyl chloride is then transferred into reactors.  Then under controlled temperature and pressure conditions in a water medium, the vinyl chloride molecules are linked together to form long chains.  These long chains are called polymerized vinyl chloride or PolyVinyl Chloride.\n\n \nIn order to produce copolymer resins, an additional raw material, vinyl acetate is used at the facility.  The use of this raw material allows the production of co-polymers with vinyl chloride.  These products provide improved fusion rate properties which allow users to process the resin at lower operating temperatures.  After the PolyVinyl Chloride is created it is then dried through a natural gas fired dryer.  The dried material is then deagglomerated and transferred into storage silos.  From the storage silos the final product is packaged and stored in our finished goods warehouse from where it is transported to our customers.\n\nAs part of the reaction process a large volume of water is required.  Water that is not evaporate din the drying process and storm water that falls on site is treated through the facilityA?s waste water treatment plant prior to final discharge through the plant outfall to the Delaware River.\n\nFinal products produced at the Delaware City plant are used for medical examination gloves, adhesives, carpet backing, floor covering, automotive sealants and upholstery, bottle cap seals, traffic safety cones, automotive air filter gaskets and many other useful finished products.\n\nC.

In addition, if you considered passive mitigation measures in your analysis, you must identify both the mitigation systems in use and their effect (e.g., \"A concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of a pool and thus reduces the release rate to X.\").

This regulation requires that several conditions must be met such as; ensuring that Hot Work Permits are issued for welding and cutting operations, conducting routine compliance audits to ensure compliance, mechanical integrity to ensure the equipment is properly maintained and conducting process hazard analyses.  Each of these requirements ensure that employees are provided with a safe working environment and in turn ensure that the community are adequately protected.\n\nNESHAP\n \nVinyl Chloride is a regulated substance under the EPA NESHAP and PVC MACT Standards.  These regulations limit the amount of vinyl chloride emitted to the atmosphere from routine operations. The site is also required to implement and maintain an enhanced leak detection and repair program for the early detection and repair of leaks from equipment. \n\nAmbient Air Monitoring Program (ARCAS)\n\nIn an effort to respond quickly to potential hazardous conditions an ambient air monitoring system and associated program has been implemented.  This program enables employees to monitor the atmosphere of critical process areas on a 24 hour basis.  The program is comprised of 4 gas chromatographs, each with the capability to collect atmospheric samples from 20 monitoring points.  The monitors are tied into visual alarms that are set to go off at 1 ppm (part per million).  This allows employees to be informed quickly so that immediate action can be taken to locate and stop possible leaks. \n\n5 - 50 and >50 PPM Emission Investigation Program\n\nThe 5 - 50 ppm and >50 ppm emission investigation programs were voluntarily instituted to pro-actively determine the date, time, cause, equipment, shift, location and probable cause of potential VCM emissions.

Once the situation has been corrected, a more thorough investigation, depending on concentration, is conducted to determine the root cause of the incident and to implement preventive measures to prevent recurrence of the situation. Corrective actions, that are the result of a > 50ppm emission, are tracked through the siteA?s ISO non-conformance process to ensure timely completion and a determination of the effectiveness of the action to prevent future leaks.\n\nEarly Relief Vent\n\nThe early relief venting system is designed to relieve vinyl chloride from vessels at a pressure below the pressure relief valve (PRV) rating.  This closed system prevents the release of vinyl chloride gas to the atmosphere by utilizing the siteA?s recovery system to contain vinyl chloride. \n\nISO 9002 and ISO 14001\n\nIn 1994 the facility achieved ISO 9002 Registration and in 1996 the facility achieved ISO 14001 Registration.  Furthermore the site attained registration to the new ISO9001-2000 standard in 2003, and to ISO14001-2004 in 2005. As part of the registration process, program audits are conducted by a third party on a semi-annual basis to ensure compliance.
