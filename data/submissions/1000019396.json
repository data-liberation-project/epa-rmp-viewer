If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Pelham Fire Department as well as the Mitchell County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Mitchell County Emergency Medical Service and Mitchell County Hospital (Archibald Hospital is the nearest trauma facility).  This Terminal is manned (1 operator) during transloading and does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.  The Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals - Pelham Terminal is a butane transfer facility (specifically, rail car to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, incuding the associatedpiping, transloader and eight (8) 31,000 - gallon storage tank (railcar) capacity.  This facility's worst case sceniario is the failure of the transfer system's one (1) 31,000 - gallon railcar when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (impacting off-site receptors) scenario is the BLEVE of a single railcar.  The Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals Pelham Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.

To date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane (new system) which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in-place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals Pelham Terminal's butane transfer system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Pelham Fire Department and request their assistance.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Mitchell County LEPC.  The Pelham Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nThe Facility has completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and subsequent updates/revalidations for this process. \n\n\n\nImprovement actions to be considered primarily focus on site security measures including improved monitoring and inspection access.  Other considerations include improvements to minimize off-site migration of butane in the event of a release especially in the cold season.\n\n\n\nAdditional improvements include additional site access controls and the updating of railcar handling procedures.\n\n  "
