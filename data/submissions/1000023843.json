Airgas National Welders implements many Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the propylene process and the safe handling of compressed gas cylinders to prevent any accidental release.  Along with written standard operating procedures, several administrative controls are used.  These include, operator training, emergency procedures, qualification of operators, and inventory control.  \n\n\n\nThe company uses a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as the foundation of the chemical prevention program. The PHA systematically examines the equipment, systems and procedures for handling regulated materials in order to identify the hazards that exist and how to control them. The PHA included a team review of the process using the \"HAZOP\" methodology to identify hazards, review of previous incidents, verification of controls and the consequences of their failure, review of issues related to sitting and human factors and a qualitative evaluation of failures of control.  \n\n\n\nImplementation of PSM/RMP produced improvements to the process. Refer to PSM/RMP corrective action log. At this time there are no additional changes planned.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAirgas National Welders has a written Emergency Action Plan that is site specific as well as an Emergency Response Plan to be implemented in case of an accident, release or spill of a hazardous material.  The EAP is a separate document. Airgas National Welders Emergency Response Plan consists of a trained hazardous material response team in accordance with the company's Emergency Response Manual.  The Emergency Response Manual and EAP outline the trained personnel, equipment, and actions that are to be taken in case of a release of a hazardous material.  Hazardous material communication training is also conducted to protect the safety of all "
