      "SummaryText": "AmeriGas Columbia Terminal - Facility Description\n\nThe AmeriGas Columbia terminal is a propane storage and distribution facility. The facility includes ten (10) above-ground storage tanks. Each Tank has 30,000 Gallons Water Capacity W.C each. Three (3) of the tanks are for butane service and the other seven (7) are for propane service. The maximum quantity of product in pounds that we can store on site of propane is 747,094 pounds and butane is 372,387 pounds. There are six (6) Compressors used to unload the rails cars. The terminal has a siding with eight (8) rail towers designed to hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of Compressors. Compressors withdraw propane vapors from the storage tank and compress them or increase their pressure and discharge into the rail cars to be unloaded. This process slightly decreases the pressure in the bulk storage tanks and increases the pressure in the rail cars. As a result, liquid propane flows from rail car to the bulk storage tanks. \n\nThe terminal has four (4) Liquid Pumps and four (4) bulkheads. Using the loading pumps, transports are loaded at the terminal, when required. There are also five (5) Plant Wide Emergency Shutdown Buttons, three (3) electrical system shutdown buttons, and twelve (12) individual system pneumatic shutdown buttons that are strategically located throughout the terminal that are used to power off the electrical equipment including pumps, compressors and air compressors, pneumatically charged Emergency Shutdown Valves (ESVs) and internal valve. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\u000b\n\nThe same properties that make propane and butane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding comm"

The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers. \n\nThe site and company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prevention of incidents, injuries, and releases at the facility. Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures, and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter. The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines, and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices. The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via inspection and painting programs.\n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, shutdown systems are also installed on site. Shutdown systems include remotely controlled, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown affected equipment and isolate a problem once detected. Portable fire extinguishers are also available on site for employee use.\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.

Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel as well as Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at an AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals. In addition, the site complies with EPA\u0092s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. \n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained in the terminal\u0092s loading and Emergency Action Plan procedures and many have also been trained using the National Propane Gas Association\u0092s (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\u000b\n\nWorst Case Scenario\u000b\n\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario. Worst case scenario is analyzed by estimating distance to an overpressure endpoint of 1 psi resulting from vapor cloud explosion of a cloud containing largest quantity of regulated substance from a vessel or process pipe failure. Per CFR 68.25.b.1, \u0093For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\u0094 is the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe greatest amount of propane held is 30,000 Gallons or 110,000 lbs. The total quantity released was 110,000 lbs.

The ambient air temperature assumed is 25 deg C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent.. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\u000b\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was chosen. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. The calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure endpoint for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\n\nBroken or burst propane loading hoses were determined to be the most common failure. Pumps and Compressors were also considered. Maintenance and mitigation devices are in place that would mitigate the risks of release from pumps and compressors. Vessel overfilling is mitigated administratively. The storage tanks are filled only to a maximum of 85% of the total capacity to allow expansion of the product.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\u000b\n\nThough the site is classified as a non-responding facility, it maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), complying with state of Tennessee\u0092s regulations. Both plans include procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement, and medical organizations. Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. Should an actual incident occur, the plans five guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\n\nThe EAP is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting curren"
