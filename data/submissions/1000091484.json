It is our goal to achieve and sustain  Zero Accident Tolerance through communication, information, and training. \r\n\r\nTiverton Power is a combined cycle cogeneration power plant. The regulated substance handled here is Anhydrous Ammonia which is used as a refrigerant in the Air Inlet Chiller to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe worst case and alternate case scenarios have been determined and the resulting off site consequences are on file at the Tiverton facility and represented in the overall RMP Plan. The Tiverton facility is located in a rural area and there may be off-site consequences in the unlikely event of an ammonia emergency.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Tiverton Power are to comply with EPA's accidental prevention rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia  chiller system and equipment at Tiverton Power was designed, installed, and now maintained in accordance with the aforementioned codes, laws, and regulations.\r\n\r\nTiverton Power has had one accidental release associated with the ammonia process over the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program at Tiverton Power is to contact the Tiverton Fire Department. It is our policy to request the fire department's response to any emergency and to inspect our facility yearly to ensure they are familiar with our systems and materials.\r\n\r\nThere are no current plans to revise the ammonia process at Tiverton Power. If required in the future, the changes would be processed through the PSM Management of Change procedures. The Tiverton Chiller System will continue to be monitored via required Process Hazard Analysis and PSM / RMP Complian"
