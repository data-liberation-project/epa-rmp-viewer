Facility Accidental Release Policy:  The owners, managemnet , and employees of Consolidated Grange Supply Cooperative, 318 West First, Lind Washington 99341, with branch operations at 404 West First, Lind Washington 99341 and 1201 1st. Ave., Ritzville, Washington 99169 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency reponse plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidential release.  2.  Facility Information:  *The primary activity at the Lind Fertilizer Facility is the storage, blending and sale of fertilizers to farmers.  *Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  *At Lind the anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and put into a 25,000-gallon above ground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia at Lind storage @ 85% of capacity is 21,250 gallons @ 5.15 pounds per gallon = 109,400 pounds.  *At Lind the aqua ammonia is received by tanker truck and put into 2 - 15,000 gallon aqua ammonia above ground storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia at the Lind Fertilizer Facility is 30,000 gallons filled to 95% capacity 28,500-gallons @ 7.6 pounds per gallon = 216,600 pounds.  The maximum storage in a single 15,000-gallon storage tank @ 95% of capacity is 14,250 gallons = 108,300 pounds.  3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  a. Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios - The worst-case release scenario for the Lind Fertilizer Facility is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 109,400"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.45 miles rural.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident is a release from 2-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 PPM) 11,900 pounds is .60 miles.  b.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios - The worst-case scenario for the Lind Fertilizer Facility is failure of the largest storage tank (15,000-gallons) when filled to the greatest amount would release (95%) 108,300 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200PPM) is .52 miles (Rural).  The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident is a release of 2000 gallons (15,200 pounds) from a 15,000-gallon tank.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .20 miles (rural).  4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia - The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirement for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"  5.  Five-Year History:  There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia in the past five years.  6.  The Emergency Response Program:  The facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations: * OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38; * OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and  7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned cha"
