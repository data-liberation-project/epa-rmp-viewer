This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Treatment of drinking water.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  These substance is Chlorine and is used for  water disinfection.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 8000.00 lb.  Normally, 40000 pounds of chlorine is usually present.\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Generally recognized practices for water treatment plants.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBig Cottonwood Water Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualif"
