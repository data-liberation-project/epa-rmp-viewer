Our Refrigeration Maintenance and Waste Water operators receive On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are observed by senior maintenance staff and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.\n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nWe work very closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fort Smith Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nCurrently, O. K. Foods trains and tests all refrigeration and waste water technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our ammonia and chlorine Process Safety Program is reviewed and updated annually.  Our program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available."

Foods, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  O. K. Foods strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Fort Smith Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products.  We utilize two regulated substances: anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  O.K. Foods has three independent systems at this site.  The largest system contains 61,007 pounds of ammonia.  The maximum total amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 90,751 pounds.  We have the capacity for 151,252 pounds but do not run above 60% of total cap"

      "SummaryText": "acity.\n\nAlso used at this facility is chlorine gas.  We utilize chlorine in our waste water treatment process prior to discharging effluent.  The chlorine is stored in eight, one ton cylinders.  There are two banks of four cylinders interconnected by manifold.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  We have the capacity for 16,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of one one-ton cylinder of chlorine.  The amount stored in that cylinder is 2,000 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a gas (ALOHA).\nDistance to endpoint: 1.5 miles \n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure release valve.  The emergency valves shut-down release would engage and stop the flow or an alarm would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 60 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 2,111 pounds of ammonia.  \nDistance to endpoint:  0.089 miles (158 yards)\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nTo date, this O. K. Foods facility has had no releases.\n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Leslie Salisbury, Complex Manager.  Mr. Salisbury will administrate in conjunction with the O. K. Foods management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Sebastian County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fort Smith Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe O. K.
