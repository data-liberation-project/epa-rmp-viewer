The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The GWWSB East River WWTP implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n2.0\tDescription of The GWWSB East River WWTP and Regulated Substances\n\nThe GWWSB East River WWTP handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1-ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the treated water prior to release to the receiving stream.\n\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The GWWSB East River WWTP to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe GWWSB East River WWTP completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies. The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to"

The following details the prevention program elements at The GWWSB East River WWTP that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1\tSafety Information\n\nThe GWWSB East River WWTP maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The GWWSB East River WWTP processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The GWWSB East River WWTP, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n4.2\tHazard Review\n\nThe GWWSB East River WWTP performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure The GWWSB East River WWTP operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3\tOperating Procedures\n\nThe GWWSB East River WWTP develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n4.4\tTraining\n\nThe GWWSB East River WWTP trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\n\n4.5\tMaintenance\n\nThe GWWSB East River WWTP"

A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n4.7\tIncident Investigations\nThe GWWSB East River WWTP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The GWWSB East River WWTP trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.8\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\n\nIndustry standards are followed at The GWWSB East River WWTP to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.  The vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders.  The process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art materials and technology utilizing the standards and guidelines of the Chlorine Institute, American Water Works Association, ASME, ANSI, and other applicable codes.
