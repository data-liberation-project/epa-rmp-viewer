In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public Safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurance and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illness and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety program are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use storage, manufacturing handling or the on-sitemovement of such chemicals or combinations of these activities any group of vessels which are interconnected, and separate vessals which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes activities or pieces of equipment.
