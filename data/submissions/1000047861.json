In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public Safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurance and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illness and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety program are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use storage, manufacturing handling or the on-sitemovement of such chemicals or combinations of these activities any group of vessels which are interconnected, and separate vessals which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes activities or pieces of equipment. These rules are dtailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the Facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of ammonia refrigeration Process\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses roughly about 16,00lbs of ammonia. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels, and compressors. The condensor is mounted on the engine room roof and all evaporators are located in their respective spiral freezers.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses approximently 16,000lbs of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.
