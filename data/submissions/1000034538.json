The OCA involves evaluating a worst-case release scenario as well as more likely alternative release scenarios.\r\n\r\n1.3.1 Worst-Case Scenario\r\nThe worst-case butane release scenario evaluated by the facility consists of the release of the entire amount of butane contained in a 9,000-barrel barge storage tank, which represents that largest single butane storage vessel at the facility, and resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The selection of the release quantity and scenario parameters was done in accordance with RMP requirements for a flammable substance worst case offsite consequence analysis.  The worst-case scenario resulted in a distance to the endpoint (represented as a 1 pound per square inch overpressure) of one mile.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 Alternative Scenarios\r\nFour alternative release scenarios were selected to represent more likely and realistic accidental releases of butane.  The alternative scenarios consisted of the release of butane due to a failure in process piping at two separate locations and the release of butane due to a failure of flexible hoses also at two separate locations.  All four alternative scenarios were assumed to result in a vapor cloud fire.  These scenarios assumed active mitigation measures such as emergency shutdown valves triggered by a loss of pressure in the process piping, intern"

Trafigura is required to comply with United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 because the facility will store butane on-site in quantities exceeding the rule threshold quantity for this substance.  The following executive summary is provided in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155.\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nTrafigura is committed to operating and maintaining its butane operations in a safe and responsible manner.  Trafigura has developed and implemented accidental release prevention and emergency response provisions at the facility, including those required under the USEPA RMP rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The facility is also subject to other emergency plan regulations such as those under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, state Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (ECPRA), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) rules.\r\n\r\n1.2 Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\r\nTrafigura operates a petroleum product terminal located in Corpus Christi, Texas, which will handle butane, a regulated flammable substance under RMP regulations.  Trafigura's butane marine loading activities consist of:\r\n\r\n* Butane transfer from trucks to pressurized bullet tanks or floating storage pressurized barges;\r\n* Butane transfer from pressurized bullet tanks to floating storage pressurized barges; and\r\n* Closed loop marine butane load-out from barges to pressurized ocean going vessels.\r\n\r\nThe following transfer rates are expected at the facility:\r\n\r\n* Trucks - Fifteen trucks per day with a capacity of 200 barrels each and capable of being unloaded t"

The alternative scenarios resulted in a distance to the endpoint (i.e., the lower flammability limit of butane) of 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\n1.4 General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe facility's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with USEPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations.  Key elements include:\r\n\r\n* Process Safety Information - Information regarding butane hazards, process technology, and process equipment is complied, updated, and made available to operating personnel.\r\n* Process Hazard Analysis - Analyses are conducted every five years with the objective of identifying, evaluating, and controlling the process hazards, and findings and recommendations are promptly addressed.\r\n* Operating Procedures - Procedures are developed and maintained up to date to provide instructions for safe operations of process equipment during various phases of operation.\r\n* Training - Initial and recurring training is provided to all employees involved in operating a regulated process.\r\n* Mechanical Integrity - Procedures are developed and implemented to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels, process piping, transfer hoses, and other process equipment.  These include procedures for maintenance, training of maintenance employees, and inspection and testing.\r\n* Management of Change - Written procedures are used to manage changes to process-related chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures, and other changes that may affect a regulated process.\r\n* Pre-Startup Review - Reviews are conducted for new or significantly modified processes to ensure the facilities and processes are adequate and safe for operation.\r\n* Compliance Audits - Periodic audits are conducted at least every three years to verify compliance with RMP requ"

Therefore, there have not been any releases in the previous five years of an RMP regulated chemical.\r\n\r\n1.6 Emergency Response Program\r\nThe facility has developed an emergency response program, including a written emergency response plan with notification, emergency medical treatment, and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nTrafigura continually strives to improve process safety.  The facility's butane process is newly built and designed in accordance with recognized safety industry standards and/or government requirements.  Trafigura expects that on-going programs such as process hazard analyses, compliance audits, and incident investigations will result in continual improvements to process safety."
