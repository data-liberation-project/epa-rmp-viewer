      "SummaryText": "Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:\nCountry Fresh processes fluid milk.The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of fluid milk within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing faclities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperature but is handled as a gas liquified under pressue. The refrigerant system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, comprssors, piping and valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nCountry Fresh iscommitted to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PMS), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operating safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response stepts to take in the event of a release.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \nAs part of its PSM program, Country Fresh has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs include:\n- Process safety information\n-Sandart Operating Procedures\n- Employee Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-startup review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Works Permits\n- Contractor Safety\n\nEmergency Response Information:\nAs part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an"

      "SummaryText": "incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications of local emergency response agencies, as well as the public.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911, Genesee County LEPC, Police, Sherrif Deparment, Fire Department and Young's Environmental.\n\nFive year accident history:\nCountry Fresh has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this time.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety:\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  The most important of these are increased employee training, preventive maintenance and timely inspections.  In addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PMS Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program."
