These commitments are documented in our safety, health, environmental, product safety and security policies. These policies are put into practice through a disciplined management framework called the Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).\n\n\n\nExxonMobil's OIMS framework establishes common worldwide expectations for controlling operations integrity risks inherent in its businesses. Operations integrity addresses all aspects of ExxonMobil's business, including security, that can impact safety, health and environmental performance. \n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Beaumont Polyethylene Plant (BPEP) has an ongoing accident prevention program and detailed Plant emergency response plan that involves the participation of local fire, rescue and hospital facilities. BPEP is certified as an OSHA STAR Work Site for complying with the most stringent health and safety standards set by OSHA. BPEP has been an OSHA STAR worksite since 1984, successfully completing ten subsequent OSHA STAR inspections.\n\n\n\nBPEP, in addition to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, is committed to reducing overall emissions and waste generation from operations wherever technically and economically feasible. This is in alignment with ExxonMobil's commitment to safeguarding and protecting the physical environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED"

      "SummaryText": " SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Beaumont Polyethylene Plant is a world-scale producer of low density, linear low density, and high density polyethylene resins manufactured on three (3) tubular reactors and three (3) gas-phase reactors, with a fourth gas-phase reactor scheduled for start up in the second half of 2019.\n\n\n\nThe facility occupies 350 acres near the Beaumont Municipal Airport. \n\n\n\nThe manufacturing processes at BPEP utilize EPA RMP regulated substances including Butene, Ethylene, Hydrogen, isoPentane, isoButane and Propylene.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nBPEP has developed programs to comply with industry's most stringent environmental, health and safety standards including the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care program, OSHA's PSM standard and the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, BPEP is certified as an OSHA STAR Work Site for complying with the health and safety standards set by OSHA. BPEP has been an OSHA STAR worksite since 1984.  Facilities in the STAR program are required to demonstrate exemplary safety performance and agree to work cooperatively with OSHA to serve as an example for the rest of industry to follow.  OSHA STAR participants are audited by OSHA for compliance every few years.  BPEP has earned the prestigious STAR recognition and has maintained it through ten OSHA inspections over a thirty-five year period.\n\n\n\nBPEP takes a systematic, proactive approach to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our process safety management systems address each of the essential features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n-Process safety information           -Process hazard analysis              -Compliance audits\n\n-Operating procedures              -Incident investigation\n\n-Training                             -Employee participation\n\n-Mechanical Integrity                 -Hot work permit\n\n-Management of change                "

      "SummaryText": " -Contractor safety\n\n-Pre-startup review\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to our industry leading management programs, we have designed state of the art systems and equipment to control, prevent, detect and mitigate potential accidental releases.\n\n\n\nBPEP employs extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of process equipment and safety systems.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance techniques to identify preventative maintenance opportunities before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs needed to return equipment to acceptable specifications.\n\n\n\nBPEP's employees are trained to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made.  As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training, including written tests and field demonstrations.\n\n\n\nThe processes at BPEP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The Accident Prevention Program summarized previously is applied to all covered processes at the facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Accident Prevention Program activities, BPEP utilizes safety features in and around the process operating units to aid in, (1) quickly detecting a release, (2) containing/controlling a release, and (3) reducing the consequences of (mitigating) a release.  The following types of safety features are utilized in various processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n     - Process area detectors with alarms\n\n     - CTTV surveillance cameras\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n     - Process pressure relief valves that discharge to a flare system for capturing and incinerating episodic releases\n\n  "

This change resulted in the removal of the last remaining potential toxic release inventory on site.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSince June 2014, BPEP has not experienced any reportable accidents involving a Part 68 regulated substance in a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBPEP's emergency response program serves as a line of defense against accidental releases and other emergencies and provides the procedures for reacting to accidental releases and other emergencies if they occur. BPEP maintains a written emergency response plan at the facility which is included in the community response plan. \n\n\n\nBPEP is a member of the Sabine Neches Chiefs Association (SNCA) and the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). These organizations consist of industrial and municipal fire departments, Red Cross, Civil Defense and law enforcement agenc"
