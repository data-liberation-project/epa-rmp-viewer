Hazardous substances used in the production of fuel ethanol are managed according to applicable local, state and federal laws.  POET Preston regularly inspects and monitors the entire fuel ethanol production facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nPOET Preston operates an ethanol production facility in Preston, MN in Fillmore County.  The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn in a dry mill process. Dried distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS) are produced as a co-product and are used as livestock feed.  A denaturant, natural gasoline, is added to the ethanol prior to shipment.  The denaturant storage capacity is approximately 500,000 pounds which contains five RMP substances that exceed the threshold quantities.  The following RMP substances are found in the denaturant; 1-Butene, Butane, Isobutene, Pentane, and Isopentane with the respective concentrations of 3%, 8%, 5%, 28%, and 24%.  The facility recently removed one of the Anhydrous Ammonia tanks from the facility.  There remains one Anhydrous Ammonia tank on site which contains an amount below the reportable threshold quantity for this RMP.  \n\nPrevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Tips\nPOET Preston has complied with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  As a Program 3 Facility, POET Preston maintains a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM).  The PSM plan requires facilities to monitor covered processes through the gathering of process safety information, performing process safety hazard analyses, maintaining and reviewing operating procedures, providing employee training, maintaining mechanical integrity, utilizing a management of change structure, pre-start-up safety reviews, completing compliance audits, document incident investigations, maintaining employee participation, maintaining a hot work permit program, and provide oversight a"
