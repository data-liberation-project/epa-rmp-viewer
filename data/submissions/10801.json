The Little Knife Gas Plant has operated over twenty years (successfully started up in July, 1978) without any reportable release of hazardous substances. \n\nThe Little Knife Gas plant has three flammable substances listed in the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule above the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs each. These are:\n\t\n\t\u0015\tflammable mixture (ethane, methane, propane, butane mixture)\n\t\u0015\tpropane (propane storage tanks)\n\t\u0015\tbutane (butane storage tanks).\n\t\nThe Little Knife Gas Plant process also contains hydrogen sulfide, a listed toxic substance in the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.  However, the total inventory of hydrogen sulfide in the gas plant equipment and piping within the plant boundaries is significantly less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs and thus is not considered a regulated substance for the RMP submission.

A small plant environment and teamwork approach provide an active forum for employee participation in all facets of process operations.  Examples of employee involvement range from participation in the initial process hazard analysis in 1992  to implementation of the PHA team's findings.  Employees have access to all information created as a part of the process safety management standard. In addition, specific employee participation activities include operations teams and periodic safety meetings to discuss specific safety-related topics.  Meeting attendance sheets are maintained as primary documentation. \n\nEmployee participation is key to the training of new employees and retraining of experienced employees.  The Little Knife Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operations. All plant personnel (operators, maintenance personnel) receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

To achieve these goals, PetroHunt strives to integrate safety features in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its facilities. PetroHunt policy is to implement practical controls and management systems to prevent foreseeable potential releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a release does occur, the Little Knife Gas Plant has a well-defined emergency action plan and trained personnel to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nPetroHunt operates the Little Knife Gas Plant, located in Billings county, North Dakota, to produce natural gas and sulfur from sour gas.  The facility consists of a gas processing facility, with unit operations designed to  separate various hydrocarbon components and sulfur from the incoming sour gas stream.  The facility is designed for operation during extreme winter weather conditions, typically encountered in North Dakota.  A control room, located within the facility, houses the process control instrumentation, with continuous coverage provided by process operations technicians. \n\nThe facility operation consists of a closed-loop continuous process, beginning with inlet sour gas, with various hydrocarbon products and sulfur for sale.  A portion of the fuel gas is consumed in the process to provided the needed energy for the facility operations.  Key process components include gas separators, patented amine treatment process for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, various hydrocarbon separation units, sulfur plant, incinerator, and all utilities necessary for the plant operation.  In addition, liquid propane and butane produced are collected in a battery of storage tanks, and eventually shipped by tank trailer.\n\nThe Little Knife Gas Plant has an excellent safety and environmental record, with a high level of employee involvement and commitment to"

The purpose of the HA was to develop strategies for emergency response and actions for the site.  It must be noted an extensive emergency response plan has been implemented at the site to comply with local and State regulations and coordinate with the local responders.\n\nTo perform the hazard analysis, PetroHunt assembled a team of experts who are familiar with the design, operation, and maintenance of the Little Knife Gas Plant operations.  The HA team used the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), revised April, 1999, and other EPA guidance documents, as necessary.  The HA team used RMPComp ( v 1.06) software, developed by EPA and the CAMEO team of Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO).  The analysis results were plotted using Mapping Application for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks (MARPLOT).  The results of the offsite consequence analysis of each regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is provided below.\n\nFlammable Mixture Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the flammable mixture is a catastrophic failure of the field gas discharge scrubber, releasing the entire contents of the vessel, containing 3,700 lbs of flammable mixture containing ethane, methane, propane, and butane over a 10-minute period.

For this WCS, the tank is assumed to be at its maximum quantity (90% of the maximum tank volume).  A vapor cloud is formed containing the total quantity of propane and 10% of the vapor is assumed to detonate with a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the endpoint of 1-psi for this WCS is 0.40 miles from the propane storage tank area.  Although PetroHunt has numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage  consequences of such a release, no credit for any safeguards (e.g., passive mitigation measures) was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. \n\nButane Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the toxic substance is a catastrophic failure of one or more of four butane storage tanks, releasing the entire contents of the vessel, approximately 127,000 lbs of liquid butane, over a 10-minute period.  A vapor cloud is formed containing the total quantity of butane and 10% of the vapor is assumed to detonate with a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
