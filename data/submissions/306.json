      "SummaryText": "Farmers Cooperative Grain Co. is an agricultural related business which sells anhydrous ammonia to area crop producers.  The anhydrous ammonia plant consists of four tanks: 1-30,000 gal., 1-18,000 gal., and 2-11,000 gal. tanks with a toal holding capacity of 306,000 lbs. when filled to 85% capacity.  The facility is designed and maintained in accordance with all local, state, and federal rules and regulations.  Each year the employees who work with NH3 are trained at state schools in safety information, hazards, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures.  Employees are trained on a rotational basis whereby each receives specific training once every three years.  The worst case scenario would include the largest tank to  rupture and release 132,000 lbs. of NH3 with a distance to endpoint of 1.10 miles affecting approximately 1200 people.  Public receptors would include a school, many residences, hospital, public park, and the downtown business area.  Our emergency response plan has been discussed with the Caldwell Fire Dept. and they have agreed to be our first responder in the event of an emergency."
