Processing Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry processing.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) used for refrigeration. \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. To perform the required off site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used RMP Comp Ver 1.07.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest vessel on site.  In this scenario Ammonia (anhydrous) is released. That release would come from the main ammonia receiver or adjacent piping. Ammonia vapor would escape to the atmosphere at pressure. The toxic endpoint is estimated at 1.2 miles using EPA's RMP Comp utility. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Processing pipes.  The scenario involves the release of Toxic ammonia, and is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minute.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s). These active mitigation systems h"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses are what if scenarios and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner based on a risk rating severity/probability matrix.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, George's, Inc. Processing Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The procedures are reviewed and and certified annually at a minimum. Operating procedures are readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nGeorge's, Inc.

Corrective actions required as a result of audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant promptly investigates any chemical process incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance, employee injury, or product contamination.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years and considered in the process hazard analysis.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Refrigeration employees participate in a Training review and evaluation at six month intervals.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  George's, Inc.
