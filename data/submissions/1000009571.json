The City of San Juan Fire Department is hte first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidental releases of hazardus substances,including chlorine, where the employee can neutralize, or control the release in the immediate release area.\n\nThe City of San Juan has taken steps to train the operators,supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.the training includes classroom and hands on training on the proper use of emergency response equipment and procedures. All employees are also aware of where the phone numbers of the first responders are located should a releases occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of San Juan Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine for disinfection. The maximum inventory and threshold quantity for Chlorine is shown below. No Ammonia is stored at this location.\n\nChlorine   Max Inv. 4,000   Threshold Quantity 2,500 lb\n\nThe City of San Juan has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize releases.
