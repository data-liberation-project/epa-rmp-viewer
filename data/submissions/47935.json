The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the AgChoice - North in Rock Port are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Rock Port Volunteer Rural Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry/liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.  This facility also handles bulk and package pesticides for field crops.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 560,784 pounds in our four 30,000 gallon storage tanks. The facility has twenty 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, seven double 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, and 52 1,500 gallon nurse tanks, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 933,594 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The facility will adopt changes required to meet the 1999 ANSI Code as budgets and time will allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environ"
