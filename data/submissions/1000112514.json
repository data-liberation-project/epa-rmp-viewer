Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWestlake Longview Corporation (WLC) came into existence in December 2006 when Westlake Chemical Corporation purchased Eastman Chemical Company\u0092s polyethylene assets located within the Eastman Chemical Company Texas Operations (TXO) plant site near Longview, Texas. With the sale of these and other assets within TXO, the plant site has developed into a closed access industrial park, also known as the Sabine Industrial District. WLC\u0092s production personnel include TXO Leased Workforce operators. \n\nWLC is subject to safety policies and expectations of both Westlake Chemical Corporation and TXO.  The accidental release and emergency response policies of Eastman Chemical Company are summarized in its Administrative Policies. Per WLC procedure WLC-H&S-001 General Safety Policies, all WLC employees, Leased Workforce operators, and contractors are required as a minimum to follow the TXO Authorized Safe Practice Manual (ASPM). WLC-H&S-017 Site Emergency Plan designates how WLC will interact with the TXO comprehensive site emergency plan. \n\nAs described in HSE Standards of Practice, \u0093Westlake Chemical Corporation (Westlake) accepts our responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of our employees, their families, and the public. The protection of human health, the environment, and the management of process safety and distribution risks are core values of the corporation and will be managed as an integral part of our business. The goal of all Westlake employees is to achieve continuous and measurable improvement. This policy will be enabled through Corporate HSE policies/management systems and appropriate business or site-level policies and management plans that establish objectives and targets.

Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nStationary Source Description\n\nWithin the Sabine Industrial District, WLC produces polyethylene plastics and Epolene\u00ae waxes for industrial customer use in the manufacture of a variety of consumer and commercial products. Since its beginning, WLC has integrated its safety and emergency response practices and processes with those of TXO. Prior to the initial Risk Management Program (RMP) submittal in October 2014, WLC was considered part of the TXO plant site for purposes of compliance with RMP. In the event of an emergency, TXO provides emergency response services and coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). These support services did not change because of the independent RMP submittal; WLC continues to work closely with TXO to ensure a safe work environment and effective emergency response, if needed.\n\nRegulated Substances Description\n\nWLC uses ethylene and propane in quantities above the threshold quantity on the List of Regulated Flammable"

In addition, WLC uses anhydrous ammonia and titanium tetrachloride in quantities above the threshold quantity on the List of Regulated Toxic Substances in 40 CFR Section 68.130. \n\nFlammable Gases and Liquids\n\nBasic Information:\nEthylene is a colorless gas with a sweet odor. Propane, sometimes referred to as liquefied petroleum gas, is nontoxic, colorless, and virtually odorless. Both of these materials are extremely flammable. Leaks have the potential to ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nUses:\nEthylene is the basic building block for polyethylene plastics produced by Westlake. Polyethylene is used in many common items including toys, food containers, automobiles, and garbage bags. Propane is used as a modifier in some polyethylene product formulations.\n\nAmmonia, Anhydrous \n\nBasic Information:\nAnhydrous ammonia is a clear, colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor. The vapors are irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite. Long-term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations can result in adverse health effects from inhalation. Gaseous ammonia is lighter than air, but vapors from a leak may initially hug the ground. Ammonia gas is normally not considered a serious fire hazard, but at high enough concentration and under the right conditions, it can ignite and burn. Ammonia is soluble in water, forming a corrosive liquid. \n\nUses:\nWLC uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. \n\nTitanium Tetrachloride\nBasic Information:\n\nTitanium tetrachloride is a heavy liquid with a yellowish color and a sharp, pungent odor. It reacts with water or atmospheric moisture to produce a white cloud of titanium oxide and hydrochloric acid vapors. Long-term exposure to low concentrations of hydrochloric acid or short-term exposure to high concentrations of hydrochloric acid may result in adverse health effects from inhalation. In h"

Coordination between WLC and TXO is also described in this procedure. Initial incident reports are directed to Plant Protection, TXO. The Plant Protection guard receiving the call notifies emergency response services and WLC representatives as outlined in the TXO comprehensive site emergency response plan. \n\nKey elements of the emergency response plan as it relates to community emergency response include, but are not limited to, the following: \n-\tTXO maintains an emergency response team whose members are specially trained and equipped to respond to all types of emergencies such as leaks, spills, and fires.\n-\tTXO emergency response personnel use a computerized modeling system to predict the concentration and location of any vapor cloud resulting from a hazardous vapor release using real time weather information.\n-\tResponse is coordinated with emergency response agencies in the community via"
