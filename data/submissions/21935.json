This commitment is demonstrated by\n the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design,\n installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C.\n (Enterprise) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEnterprise Products Operating, L.P. operates the Neptune Gas Plant located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana.\nEnterprise Gas Processing, LLC is the owner of this facility.  The Neptune Gas Plant is a cryogenic expander \nplant which extracts natural gas liquids from an inlet stream of produced natural gas.  The plant recovers natural \ngas liquids from the Nautilus Pipeline.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline.\n\nThe Neptune Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceed \nthreshold quantities.  Based on process knowledge, Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities\nkept on site.  These quantities are maintained in process vessels and piping at normal operating conditions\nand do not necessarily represent maximum capacities of the equipment.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Neptune Gas Plant are\nnatural gas liquids and natural gas.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the \ndistance to public receptors.  In addition, the Neptune Gas Plant is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the\nNeptune Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) \nprogram.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSYS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting\nfrom a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous\nrelease and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion \nshall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for\na flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance in a vessel forms\na vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  The worst-case distance calculations were based\non the largest vessel of each substance at 100% capacity.  Natural gas liquids is the worst-case flammable\nrelease with a 0.33-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nA second alternative case was considered.  The case involved a seal leak from one of the NGL pumps.  The \nscenario is a more probable case but was not the maximum alternative case as the distance to the 1 psi\noverpressure endpoint was only 0.08 miles.  This is because the NGL pumps were purchased with a mechanical\nseal busing that has a clearance passage for release of only 0.011 inches diametrically.  This clearance yields\na hole of only 0.05 square inches and is therefore not considered as a maximum alternative case.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A\nhypothetical release scenario has been identified.  A broken \u00be inch, schedule 80, stainless steel nipple on the \ncold separator could result in a release to the atmosphere.  The spilled cold separator fluid will vaporize and\nmay ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud\nfire with an endpoint of the lower flammability (LFL) for the fluid.  The alternative-case release of cold separator\nfluid would result in a 0.16-mile distance to the 1 psi over"

Therefore, \nanalysis of worst-case or alternative release scenarios for toxic substances are not required.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Neptune Gas Plant.  Because\nthe processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management\nProgram (RMP) regulations are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's)\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and\ndescribes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Neptune Gas\nPlant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences\nof catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help\nto ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open\ncommunications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  \n\nThe Neptune Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.\nThese programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), \nregularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms,\n near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first air, etc.).\n\nThe Neptune Gas Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident\nprevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in\ncharge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the\nemergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.\n\nThe Neptune Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation\nof the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process\nparameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment\nconsiderations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and \nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and\ntemperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures\nand trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for\nevaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not\ncompromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Neptune Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various\nprocesses are"

Implementation of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. \nThis ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. \nAll approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final\nresolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the\noriginal design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  Periodic\nreviews are conducted at lease every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer\noperating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Neptune Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as\n(1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and\n(6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also\nprovide the basis for training new operato"
