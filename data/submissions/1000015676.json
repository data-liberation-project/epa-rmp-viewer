This program involved several days of audits by the  Missouri Department of Labor on all facets of our safety program including our accident prevention program.  We also consistently maintain a recordable injury rate below industry averages.  We strive to continuously improve the safe operation of the ethylene oxide, methyl chloride, and trimethylamine processes by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of these systems.  All regulated processes are designed in accordance with good engineering practices.  Periodic auditing of the Process Safety Management Program ensures that any system changes or modifications are evaluated and the necessary safety precautions and/or safety improvements are made before the process is placed into  operation."

All are present in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity for applicability of EPA's Accidental Release Program. Ethylene oxide, methyl chloride (both are toxic chemicals), and trimethylamine (a flammable chemical) are utilized at this facility for the manufacture of nutritional supplements, animal food products for the poultry, beef, dairy, and companion animal industry, and also in the oil well production industry. Ethylene oxide is also repackaged for use in the sterilization of medical implements and spices. BCP Ingredients commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment for employees, as well as providing a safe and healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passivemitigation, and monitoring detection systems. BCP Ingredients adheres to all applicable Federal, State, and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these and all chemicals. All information regarding BCP Ingredients Risk Management Plan has been submitted to EPA utilizing EPA's RMP Submit Software.                                                                                                                                                               \nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nBCP Ingredients complies with the Process Safety Management Rule of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 for the prevention of hazardous chemical releases, and is therefore subject to the requirements of EPA's Program 3 instead of Program 2. It should be noted that no data is reported for Program 2 in the RMP submit data because BCP Ingredients is subject only to Program 3.

The Process Safety Management Program ensures that the processes and the equipment in the processes are designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards, and that the processes follow good engineering practices. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes continuous inspections and testing of equipment and monitoring devices in the processes to detect any deficiences and correct them before it contributes to a potential release incident.

It is BCP Ingredients policy to contact the local emergency planning committee and the local fire department (Aurora Rural Fire Department) in the event of a hazardous chemical release. BCP Ingredients has contracted an emergency response group (Environmental Management Inc.) that will respond to any hazardous chemical release requiring any cleanup operation. BCP Ingredients has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on it's emergency action plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, they will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary.\n\nCommittment to S"
