Maple Leaf Farms Inc. is committed to protect their employees and the people of the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nThe Maple Leaf Farms, Inc. Executive Board is committed to making Maple Leaf Farms the safest and best processing plant in Indiana and have given the plant manager the authority to purchase the equipment and training required to maintain a Maple Leaf Farms/Serenade Foods Emergency Response Team.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nMaple Leaf Farms Processing Plant is located at 9166 N 200 E. which places the processing plant 700 ft from the intersection of 900 N. & 200 E.  The facility consists of a main office building with 2 building complexes behind it and to the north of the main plant.  The main processing plant processes approximately 500,000 ducks per month as whole body ducks or as parts for further processing or sale.  The only regulated chemical used by Maple Leaf Farms is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  There is approximately 19,600 lbs of ammonia within the system. \r\n\r\nAs a part of our prevention plan we have performed a worst case and alternate release scenario centered around the possibility of an ammonia release. The worst case scenario have a threat distance of 2.7 miles, while potentially impacting 2000 people according to the most recent census.  The alternate case scenario calculated to have a threat distance of 2.5 miles, while potentially impacting 1800 people according to the most recent census. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nMaple Le"
