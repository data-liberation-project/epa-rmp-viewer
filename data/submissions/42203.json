              "Description": "United Suppliers, Inc. - Salina, KS uses the recommended matrix approach to preventing accidental releases at the site.  The site stores 11,200 gallons  anhydrous ammonia in a portable trailer.  This ammonia storage is used to supply ammonia to a portable pipe reactor operation, on a periodic basis.  Salina's prevention program is directed toward the operation of setting up the portable ammonia trailer, filling the trailer, and securing the trailer after reactor operations are complete.  Salina performs visual inspections plus standard operating methods for hooking up and transporting the portable trailer.  During reactor operations, the prevention program is governed by PSM compliance requirements associated with portablepipe reactor.  The RMP for the Salina site meshes with PSM requirements of the portable pipe reactor to provide the appropriate regulatory covereage.  In addition to above policies, industry standard equipment inspections and testing ensure the continued viability of the ammonia trailer.  Close contact is maintained with the LEPC and other local agencies.",

This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, the Salina facility is prepared to work with the Saline County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\n\nThe Salina facility's primary activity is the storage and blending of fertilizers for wholesale purposes.  These activities include storage of anhydrous ammonia.  This activity involves receiving an ammonia trailer that is disconnected from the truck.  The ammonia trailer is staged for use by a contract portable pipe reactor.  The portable pipe reactor comes on site to react ammonia with phosphoric acid to produce an ammonium polyphosphate liquid fertilizer.   The reactor operation is contracted with others and covered by a separate PSM (owned by the contract organization).  The operation and maintenance procedures for the portable reactor operation reside with the contract organization.  The Emergency Response Procedures for the Salina site and contracted organization are integrated into one response, prior to operation of the portable reactor.\n\nUnited Suppliers, Inc. - Salina, KS has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The facility maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood and controlled.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written operating procedures are maintained for covered process operations.

Covered process equipment is routinely inspected and tested.  Maintenance activites are conducted by qualified personnel.  Deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:  Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or procedures.  Affected personnel are informed and trained to deal with authorized system changes.\n\nPre-Startup Review:  Technical and operational reviews will be conducted on new processes and/or modifications to existing covered processes.  Reviews confirm the construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable.  Reviews are completed prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Internal audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions specified under the RMP rule are being implemented.  At a minimum, these audits are conducted every three (3) years.  Any determined corrective actions are completed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigations:  Investigations are conducted to determine the root cause of covered process incidents.  In addition to determination and correction, investigations are directed toward preventing reoccurence.  Investigations become process safety information and are retained for five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation:  United Suppliers, Inc. - Salina, KS employee(s) actively contribute in the following:  process hazard assessments, operating procedure development, maintenance procedure development, training development and implementation, pre-startup reviews, incident investigations, an"

Nor to our knowledge, has there been any releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage and/or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Action Plan:  United Suppliers, Inc. - Salina, KS has a written emergency action plan.  This plan includes notification of the Saline County LEPC.  Local authorities have been provided with emergency planning and community right-to-know information.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  United Suppliers, Inc. - Salina, KS  views safety improvement as a continual process.  Periodic evaluations (both internal and external) are performed to assess the facility status.  At this time, and aside from sustaining maintenance activities, there are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding anhydrous ammonia."
