We are proud of our safety record and strive to ensure that we design and operate our facility so that hazards are minimized and risks controlled.\n\nWe use a refrigeration process to maintain appropriate temperatures at critical control points in our operation.  Anhydrous ammonia, the refrigerant used in this process, is regulated by EPA under 40CFR part 68 and by OSHA under 29CFR 1910.119.  We have specific programs and practices in place for controlling this process to help ensure that a harmful release of ammonia does not occur.  These programs and practices include:\n-\tUse of recognized good engineering practices in the design, installation and operation of our refrigeration equipment and ensuring this equipment meets applicable codes and standards.\n-\tContinual assessment of hazards and safeguards in our process, in order to reduce risks.\n-\tUse of release prevention practices that have been recognized as effective by Federal and State experts.\n-\tMaintaining preparedness and contingency plans for responding to any emergency that may occur and coordinating these plans with local response agencies.\n\nUsing EPA-approved methods and technology, we have analyzed worst-case and alternative scenarios for the unlikely release of ammonia from our Refrigeration Process.  The results of these analyses, including any public or environmental receptors are available upon request to facility management and/or from the US EPA.  \n\nOur release prevention program focuses on preventing hazardous releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Our equipment and management practices are consistent with OSHA regulations and recognized good engineering practices specified by ASHRAE, ASME and ASTM standards.

These and other activities are part of our Emergency Contingency Plan that is coordinated with local Fire Department and Emergency Response agencies.\n\nWe are continually seeking ways to improve the safety of our operations.  Consistent with that policy, our facility has been designed to include best practices in safety and environmental protection advancements.  As evidence of this commitment, we completed a process hazard analysis in September 2007 and have resolved all recommendations from that analysis.  Our Process Safety and Risk Management Procedures and Emergency Response Plan are in place and being used to manage hazards and control risks associated with hazardous materials at our facility.  Annual reviews of these procedures and operating procedures and mechanical integrity practices occur to ensure they are current and reflect actual practice.  We continually monitor our operations to identify ways to maintain a leadership position within our industry in environmental, health and safety practices."
