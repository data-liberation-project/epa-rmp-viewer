The incoming components include metal cans, plastic valves and caps, and corrugated\n\nboxes. The outgoing finished products are consumer commodities for various sectors including personal care,\n\nhousehold, food and pharmaceutical. The finished products include air fresheners, hair mousses and sprays,\n\nbody sprays, cooking sprays, cleaning products, liquid soaps, shaving creams, and foot sprays. Many of these\n\nproducts are aerosols and contain flammable propellants.
