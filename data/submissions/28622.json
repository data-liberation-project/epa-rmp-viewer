This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances; however, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\nThe ConocoPhillips Gas-to-Liquids Demonstration Plant is located in Ponca City, Kay County, Oklahoma. The facility is a three stage process.\u00a0 The first stage converts natural gas and oxygen into Syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen)\u00a0in a catalytic partial oxidation process.\u00a0\u00a0 The\u00a0second stage, Fischer Tropsch, converts the Syngas into primary paraffins (alkanes).\u00a0 Olefins (alkenes) and oxygenated hydrocarbons can also be produced, but usually in smaller quantities.\u00a0 The primary products consist of compounds ranging from methane through\u00a0heavy wax components.\u00a0\u00a0 The lighter products\u00a0can be recycled back for reconversion to Syngas.\u00a0 A major byproduct of the process is water.\u00a0\u00a0 The final step is to separate the liquids and hydroprocess them into finished fuel products such as diesel, jet fuel and naphtha.\u00a0 Alternative products can include high quality waxes, lubricating oils, solvents and white oils. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\nRESULTS OF THE HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThe following facility summary of the Risk Management Plan is based on direction from the EPA Risk Management Program regulation 40 CFR part 68, under the Clean Air Act, Section 112r(7).  From the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document (dated April 15, 19"

The EPA used the term \"endpoint\" to define the concentration level at which there would be no adverse impact to the public or environment from a release or catastrophic event from a stationary site.  The \"Covered\" process (a process containing flammables in excess of the threshold quantities of a covered substance in greater than 1% concentration) was categorized as a Program Level 1 process (see below for description).\r\nThere is one WCS for the facility associated with a release of flammable substance.  The WCS is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of one vessel.  The WCS is a storage tank containing 20,000 gallons (11,820 pounds) of hydrogen.  The calculated distance to the 1-psi endpoint is 0.25 miles radius.  The 1-psi endpoint crosses the boundary between the facility and Williams Pipeline, but does not affect any public receptors as defined by EPA.\r\nCredits for any administrative controls surrounding the storage tank were not taken in the calculations.  The inventory was assumed completely released, vaporized, and ignited, resulting in a VCE. No credit for passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating the WCS.\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nWithin the past five years, this process has not had an incident or accidental release that caused or could have caused offsite impacts as defined in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  In the event an incident occurs, it will be carefully investigated to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nThe ConocoPhillips Gas-to-Liquids Demonstration Plant has implemented an effective emergency response (ER) program to protect employees, ensure public safety, and protect the environment.

The emergency response program utilizes the ConocoPhillips Refinery Incident Command System (ICS) to manage all aspects of response. \r\nThe ER procedures address all aspects of an integrated emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing and functional certification of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Emergency response employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific duties.  The emergency response program is periodically reviewed and updated as needed. \r\nThe overall emergency response program for the two facilities is coordinated with the Kay County, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as well as local fire departments and law enforcement agencies.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The ConocoPhillips Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills with the LEPC, local emergency response organizations, and local medical providers. \r\nBased on the results of the hazard assessment, five-year accident history, and documentation of the emergen"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program. \r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe facility maintains a variety of technical documents pertaining to the safe operation and maintenance of the processes.  These documents address the hazards of the process, limits for operating parameters, specific chemical inventories, and the equipment design basis/configuration.  The primary delivery tool for information is the electronic document management system.  Employees have access to the information throughout the facility.  \r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  The facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters, e.g., temperature, level, composition.  Management ensures that the process is operated within these limits using process controls and instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems, e.g., automated shutdown systems. \r\nThe facility maintains numerous technical documents providing information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials used in construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This inf"

The process has been systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  This analysis provides a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique bringing together different points of view to identify potential hazards.  The analysis is conducted using a team of people incorporating operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  \r\nThe team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete then documented.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years and continued at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.
