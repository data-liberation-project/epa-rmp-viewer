      "SummaryText": "The City of Bogalusa Waste Water Treatment Plant is committed to a continuous effort to improve safety at the facility.  A new facility using state of the art technology for chemical release containment is on line.  Monitors are in place in the building that houses the chlorine and sulfer dioxide and the building is automatically sealed and alarms sound if a leak is detected.  The City of Bogalusa is committed to protecting its citizens while at the same time providing services needed to handle the sanitary needs of the City.\n\nThe City's waste water treatment plant is located in a low lying area behind and below the Bogalusa City Hall Complex.  The wastewater treatment plant collects all discharged waste water, including sewerage, and then using chemicals and biological substances removes sufficient contaminants to render the discharge clean enough to be returned to natural waterways.  The chemicals used in this process are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Both chemicals are on the EPA's list of toxic chemicals.  The chemicals are stored on one ton and 150 pound cylinders.  A normal quantity stored at the faciltiy approximates 16,000 pounds of chlorine and 16,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe City of Bogalusa has a combined Safety, Prevention and Emergency Response Plan.  Daily visual inspections of all vessels is made by operators and periodic maintenance is done by an outside contractor.  Signs identifying hazardous chemicals are in place.  The vessels are in a containment building.  All facility employees have been trained and there have been no accidental releases of any EPA regulated chemicals in the last five years.\n\nThe Bogalusa Waste Water Treatment Plant is included in the Bogalusa City Fire Department Emergency Response Program.  The City Fire Department keeps repair kits for chlorine and sulfur dioxide one ton cylinders.  A major release would be handled by the Fire Department.  Small accidental releases would be handled by the employees of the facility.  R"
