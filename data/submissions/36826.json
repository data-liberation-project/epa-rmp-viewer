Aqua Clear has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1997.\n\nAqua Clear's owner is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The owner administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1997.  The process is located at 3901 S. 28th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85040.  The chlorine system for Aqua Clear consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from the ton container to 20 pound cylinders.  Below provides a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\nChlorine Tanks (one ton containers)\n(2 - Operational Amount)\n(3 - Maximum that can be stored) Located in the building.\n\nChlorine Tank (20 lb. container)\n(35 - Operational Amount): Located in the building.\n\nFilling Manifold: Located at the north end of the facility outside.\n\nScrubber System: Located at the north end of the facility outside.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 6,000 pounds.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAqua Clear has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.

      "SummaryText": "rams, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Addendum (June 2004), the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Aqua Clear's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Aqua Clear has a B-kit available at the facility in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAqua Clear has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (May 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (April 2004).  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
