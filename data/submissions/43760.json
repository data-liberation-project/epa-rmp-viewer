Water treatement uses chlorine as a disinfectant to purify the City's drinking water.  Chlorinators, used in the process, are designed to control and meter the flow of chlorine gas, mix the chlorine with water and deliver the resultant water solution to the point of application.  Chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders, which are specifically designed to prevent leaks.  The cylinders are equipped with protective valve caps to prevent an inadvertent release and the valves are recessed into the end of the cylinder to protect them from being damaged during shipment or unloading.  On the average, six (6) cylinders are stored in the chlorine process room.  Only two (2) of these cylinders are actually connected to the chlorinators at any one time.  The on-line (connected) cylinders are stored within the Chlortainer System.  This is a passive-defense which contains any possible leak that may occur during the transfer of chlorine from the cylinder to the chlorinator.  The remaining four (4) cylinders are nested in cradles designed to prevent their movement.  The cradles are backed up against a brick wall to prevent a cylinder from self-propelling should a valve malfunction.  The two (2) cylinders connected to the chlorinators are controlled electronically by a central computer system (SCADA - Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), which regulates the amount of chlorine mixed in the water.  The chlorinator operates under a vacuum produced by the flow of water.  Chlorine gas under vacuum enters the chlorinator where it is electrically heated to reduce deposits of impurities and to prevent reliquefaction of the gas when the chlorinator is shut down with the chlorine supply turned off.  A chlorine gas detector continuously monitors the chlorine process room.  A sample of air is continuously withdrawn from wit"

In the event of a chlorine gas leak, which gives rise to the presence of as little as 1ppm chlorine, the chloralert will activate the alarm circuit, all interconnected safety devices which includes the ventilation system, alarm light and horn.  The horn is audible throughout the entire facility.  In addition, the two (2) cylinders connected to the chlorinator are also contained in the Chlortainer containment system, which prevents a release from the vessel enclosure to the surrounding atmosphere.  Contents of the RMP will focus primarily on the management system in place, process safety information and a hazard assessment, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance audits, employee and contractor involvement, incident investigations and emergency planning and response."
