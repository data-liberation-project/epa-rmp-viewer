THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS BASED ON A 2 MINUTE\n   RELEASE FROM A 3 INCH PIPE BREAK. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO\n   200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n        \n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n             THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE\n   STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN\n   NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC., AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL\n   SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  STORAGE AND HANDLING\n   OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA."
