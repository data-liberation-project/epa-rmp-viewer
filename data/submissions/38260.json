The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed with the USEPA as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  This RMP is also being filed with the local Administering Agency, Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, as required by California Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations, California Health & Safety Code (H&SC) Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534(b)(1) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  The Risk Management Program originally filed for this facility is being revised to reflect a major reduction in chlorine inventory and elimination of a process using chlorine.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCalifornia-American Water Co., Sacramento Division, provides water supply and distribution to a large portion of Sacramento County.

Cylinders are received by truck and handled with a forklift and hand truck.  The quantity stored is greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located in a residential neighborhood.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site daily and also respond to alarm conditions.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of California-American Water Co.  that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, California-American Water Co. has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by California-American Water Co. are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nCalifornia-American Water Co. has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA requirements at 8 CCR 5189 covering its chlorine warehousing operations.

These include, among other things, improving the seismic restraint system for 150-lb. cylinders stored at the facility, fabrication of a restraint system for a hand truck with cylinder on the transfer truck lift gate, and creation of delivery and transfer procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCalifornia-American Water Co.'s Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division and Sacramento City Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team.  It consists of First Response by properly trained and equipped Company personnel to assess the situation, rescue injured persons in the vicinity of the release, and perform defensive actions to slow or stop a release from a safe distance, notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies, and evacuation of persons on site to designated assembly areas upwind of the released gas.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which California-American Water Co. committed to accomplish at this site have been completed, including the purchase of chlorine alarm test kits and portable eyewashes for each operator.
