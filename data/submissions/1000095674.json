This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Weatherford Gas Processing Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Weatherford Gas Processing Plant, located in Parker County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas and condensate) from field gas.  Natural gas enters the Weatherford Plant, where condensate and water are separated from the field gas.  The condensate is routed to the pressurized condensate stoage vessel through a condensate flash tank and then routed offsite via trucks.  Produced water and slop oil are routed to atmospheric tanks and later routed offsite via trucks.  The inlet gas stream enters the refrigeration unit, where propane from an 18,000 gallon propane storage tank is used to cool the gas and remove heavier hydrocarbons.  The remaining gas (residue) is sent to compressor engines where it is compressed and sent to pipeline. After passing through an amine contactor to remove carbon dioxide, the Natural Gas Liquids (N"

The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the compressor station as well as the NGL tanks.  As such, the Weatherford Gas Processing Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, the worst-case release scenario for flammables, vapor cloud explosion, was performed.  Based on the analysis using the EPAs RMP*Comp &trade; calculations, the worst case scenario resulted from the 30, 000 gallon Condenaste Flash Tank and the 26,505 gallon Natual Gas Liquids (NGL) Surge Tank.  The calculated endpoint of the one pound over pressure from a vapor cloud explosion is approximatly 0.4-mile each vessel.  2010 Census Data provide through the EPA MARPLOT Version 5.1.1 identifieds that approximately 68 people and 45 residenses were within the impact area.  Based on a Google Maps aerial review the property surrounding the WEatherford Plant within a 0.4 mile radius is a mixture of agriculture, residential , idustrian and commercial properties.  No public parks or chauches were identified witin the 0.4 mile radius.  The following table provcides a summary of the worst case analysis performed.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case Impact Analysis Results Summary\n\nChemical    Vessel    Scenario    Estimated Impact Distance\n\n(miles)\n\nCondensate     Condensate Flash Tank    Vapor Cloud Explosion    0.4\n\nNGL    Plan"

Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfiling, overpressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in these scenarios.  Methods utilized to preventing such events include regualar site walks during the day to identify abnormalities not automatically monitored by the sites computer system, alarm systems, auto shut-off systems, training of operational staff,  training requiremnts for contrator and visitors, signage posted to provide unloading and loading instructions, and barriers in place to prevent vehicles from hitting equipment and tanks.\n\n\n\nColt has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Parker County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Weatherford Gas Processing Plant.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for al"

All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant has well established practices and pr"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the changed. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas"

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Weatherford Gas Processing Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Weatherford Gas Processing Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from an accidental release from a covered process has occurred at the Weatherford Gas Processing Plant within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.  \n\n&#8195;\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction, LP-Gas handling and storage facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Response Plan, which is linked with the Parker County Emergency Management District Emergency Response Plan.
