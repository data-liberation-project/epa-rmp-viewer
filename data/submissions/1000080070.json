This facility's function is to purify surface water for the purpose of providing drinking water to the surrounding area. The East Water Purification Plant's function is to purify surface water for the purpose of providing drinking water to the surrounding area. There are two regulated substances present at the facility, chlorine and ammonia. The regulated substances are both used in the disinfection process. However, a Risk Management Plan for ammonia is no longer required due to the decrease in the percent concentration being below 20%.  \n\n\n\nThe East Water Purification Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the facility's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. New equipment, processes and equipment are evaluated in our quest to improve safety and reduce or eliminate the use of chlorine gas at the plant.  No changes in the process management are currently anticipated.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance\n\n\n\nThere is one regulated chemical at the facility. The chemical is chlorine. The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 208,000 pounds. Chlorine containers and equipment, except the chlorine scrubber, are housed inside the chlorine building.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidental releases involving chlorine that resulted in any offsite impacts.  There have been no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\nEmployees, supervisors and managers are responsible for complying with the RMP regulations.

It is the East Water Purification Plant's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. This facility has a chlorine scrubber system for the storage building, along with chlorine leak detectors in the storage, feed and at all points of chemical application. The leak detectors activate a visual and audible alarm that alerts the facility staff to any release. If such a release does occur unforeseeably, the East Water Purification Plant's emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Trained personnel with the Houston Fire Department's HazMat team and the vendor/manufacturer supplying this facility with chlorine respond to chlorine releases as needed. Drinking Water Operations Chemical Spill Response Coordinator and the City of Houston's Safety Department personnel also respond to chlorine releases. Additionally, the facility is also coordinated with the City of Houston's Hazardous Materials Response Unit and the City of Galena Park Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\nEmployees, supervisors and managers are responsible for complying with the RMP regulations. It is policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In the event of a release, Drinking Water Operations has an assigned Chemical Spill Response Coordinator in addition to the City of Houston's Safety Department.\n\nThe East Water Purification Plant has taken steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.   The following sections briefly described the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\n\n\nComprehensive chemical data has been assembled.

This information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nHazard Analysis\n\n\n\nComprehensive process hazard analysis reviews are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with the facility's processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these reviews is inspection of the plant to identify deficiencies throughout the system.  The reviews are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and safety.  Hazard analysis reviews are revalidated routinely and any findings related to the hazards analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures that provide instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to the chlorination process have been assembled.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as container connection and change-outs, startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that employees operating or maintaining the chlorination process are trained.  Training ensures employees have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including emergency response, as provided in the written operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to employees working with or operating the chlorination system and equipment.  This helps to ensure that the employees understand and adhere to the current operating procedures.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\n\n\nWritten maintenance procedures have been assembled.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, overhead cranes  and other chlorination related equipment.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, terminology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by modifications in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at East Water Purification Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment operating, and maintenance procedure are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rules and regulations are being implemented.
