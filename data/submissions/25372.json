This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSolvay Advanced Polymers, L.L.C., Augusta plant is located at 3702 Clanton Road in Augusta, GA.  The plant's parent company is Solvay America, Inc.  Various chemicals are processed to produce engineering plastics.The only regulated substance at the plant in excess of the RMP threshold quantity is sulfur trioxide.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nSince the plant has no flammable substances above the threshhold quantity, no worst case scenario (WCS) for flammable substances is reported.  \n\nThe toxic WCS for the plant is a sixty minute release of 180,000 pounds of sulfur trioxide from the catastrophic failure of a sulfur trioxide rail car.   The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the distance to the endpoint.  Nearby public receptors could be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nSince the plant has no flammable substances above the threshhold quantity, no alternative case scenario (ACS) for flammable substances is reported"

Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant. Since this plant is regulated under RMP and the OSHA PSM standard, this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to he"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition).  The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Solvay Advanced Polymers, LLC., Augusta plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
