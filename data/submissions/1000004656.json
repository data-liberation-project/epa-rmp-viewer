The two most recent compliance audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Billings Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Billings Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Hydrogen sulfide and ammonia sensors with audible alarms.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1. Pressure relief valves on railcars designed to relieve at 280 psi.\r\n2. Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\r\n3. Excess flow check valves designed to plug the outlet if outflow reaches a certain flow rate.\r\n4. Safety relief valve designed with audible alarms to indicate a release.\r\n5. Derailers and chock blocks to prevent rail car movement.\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1. Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\r\n2. Water fog streams employed at origin of the leak.\r\n3. Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\r\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied air breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been one incident involving a release of anhydrous ammonia which cau"

The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria: 1) age of process; 2) extent of process hazards; 3) number of affected employees; and 4) operating history of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are to be maintained that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations; (3) temporary operations; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) emergency operations; (6) normal shutdown; (7) startup following a turnaround; and (8) start up after emergency shutdown.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  \r\n\r\nOperating procedures are to be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review is to assure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in caring out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, there is to be a comprehensi"

In addition, all operators are periodically to receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is to be conducted at least every three years.  The appropriate frequency of training is to be based on management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is to be documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n Contractors\r\n\r\nThe Billings Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, there are procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules; and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is to be accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview; (2) information about safety and health hazards including known or potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; (3) emergency response plan requirements; and (4) safe work practices must be developed and implemental regarding control of entrance, presence and exit of contract personnel prior to beginning their work.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor are to be evaluated.  Contract employee injury and illness log should be maintained.  Plant personnel are to periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfi"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Jupiter Sulphur, LLC (Jupiter) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\n\r\nJupiter owns and operates the Billings Facility located in Billings, Montana. The plant produces Ammonium Bisulfite (ABS), Ammonium Thiosulfate (ATS), and Ammonium Sulfide (AS).  All of these products contain ammonia and as such ammonia is a raw material that is stored on site.  The plant also produces elemental sulfur which does not contain ammonia.\r\n\r\nABS Production\r\n\r\nThe ABS facility consists of a burner, a heat recovery boiler, and an absorber/reactor.  The SO2 from the burner is cooled in the boiler and then is sent to the absorber/reactor where it is contacted with ammonia and water to make ABS.  The ABS is stored and either shipped as product or used as a feed material to the ATS plant.\r\n\r\nATS Production\r\n\r\nThe ATS facility consists of an absorber/reactor where ABS is contacted with H2S, ammonia, AS and water to produce ATS.
