Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Farmers Cooperative Company, (Laneboro) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of \tanhydrous ammonia.\n If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in 1-30,000 gallon storage tank, 2-1,500 gallon nurse tanks, and 21-1,000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 236,000 pounds. \n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 132,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.4  miles.  \n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.  \n\nThe mitigation measures in place at this facility are excess flow valves and an emergency shutoff system.\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc.

The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History.\t\t\n\t\nThe following is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia\nthat have occurred at the facility in the last five years:\n\nThe accidental release of anhydrous ammonia occured on August 26, 2001 at 6:30 am.  A valve on a nurse tank was left open during the theft of anhydrous ammonia.  An employee of the facility was notified of a release and after the source of the release was found to be an open valve, he put on protective equipment and closed the valve.  Due to weather conditions 35 people were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  There were no deaths or injuries as a result of this release.  A little vegetative burning of the leaves was the only physical damage in the area of the release.\n \n6.\tEmergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has:\n\n\ta.\ta written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.\tprovided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of SELECT CHEMICAL \tanhydrous ammonia\t and  \tpropane\tfor implementation at this time."
