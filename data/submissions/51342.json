The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Dedham Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has coordinated with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, stored in pressurized containers at atmospheric temperatures and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient via company and farmer owned nurse tanks.  The size and number of storage tanks is not provided in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n3.  The worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios are not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n \n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program:   Dedham Cooperative complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia, equipment and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship are consistent with ANSI K61.1 (1989 edition with amendments) and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that has resulted in an on-site death, injury, significant property damage, or an off-site death, injury, property damage, envir"

The Emergency Response Program:  Dedham Cooperative - Dedham Plant is a  non-responding facility per EPA rules 40 CFR 68.90.  We coordinate with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee to be included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  We have a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  In an emergency, it is our policy to immediately notify the Dedham Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request emergency assistance.  The Dedham Fire Department and/or emergency dispatch may in turn dispatch the Region V HazMat team from Fort Dodge.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at Dedham Cooperative.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
