The Southwest Water Treatment Plant (Facility) operates in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \"Chemical Accident Prevention Rule\" 40 CFR 68 and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) audit program. WMU operates two treatment facilities (Northeast and Southwest WTP) serving a total population of approximately 19,673. The chlorine disinfection process at the water treatment facility is the only process that requires a RMP to be submitted due to the amount of chlorine that is used and is on site. The systems that are used to perform this task are monitored for potential leaks and operate with safety as the number one concern. Early detection alarm systems and emergency response procedures are maintained to promptly address potential system failures that may cause a release of hazardous chemicals from the treatment system. \r\n\r\nWMU is committed to ensuring employees safety while operating and working with hazardous chemicals. This is done through maintaining training schedules for all employees in areas of technical expertise, safety procedures/operations, emergency response, and safety protocol. Employees are required to attended/complete a certain amount of safety trainings and review of the Standard Operating Procedure's (SOP), Operations and Maintenance manual (O&M manual), and the utilities Emergency Response Plan. WMU has implemented the prevention program requirements and have completed hazard reviews, compliance audits, and they have also implemented operating procedures, training, maintenance activities, and incident investigation procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Southwest WTP is classified as an unmanned facility with WMU employees visiting it daily. The WTP utilizes chlorine gas as a disinfectant, three (3) one-ton cylinder tanks of chlorine are stored at the WTP. One one-ton cylinder is connected to the system while the other two cylinders are connec"

The cylinders are stored in a closed room built of concrete and cement block with no ventilation to the outside, ventilation can be manually turned on. The amount of chlorine stored at the facility requires WMU to implement a RMP Level 2 Prevention Program. \r\n\r\nThe chlorine feed system that is utilized at the Southwest WTP is a Hydro Instrument one-ton container mounted gas feeder, that operates with a vacuum fail-safe function. Any failure that would occur in the valves or lines between the chlorine cylinder and the injector nozzle will cause a loss of vacuum resulting in the regulator valve to stop any release of chemical. \r\n\r\nWMU prioritizes maintaining and replacing equipment through a rigorous replacement and maintenance schedule. To prevent equipment failures, regulators are rotationally replaced on a four-year cycle and equipment is reviewed and inspected on a monthly basis. As a secondary precaution a Powell MaxPro RA Valve Closure System is in place on each regulator valve. \r\n\r\nChlorine cylinders are changed out as needed. WMU has a step-by-step SOP explaining the process of changing empty cylinders out for new ones, employees must pass a written exam on these procedures and chlorine gas properties to ensure they are effect at performing their duties in a manner that prevents incidents and injuries. Empty chlorine cylinders are shipped back to the chemical supply company to be tested and recertified before filling again. \r\n\r\nIf any of the safety features of this system should fail, there is a low level alarm system in operation at all times. An alarm will sound if there is a detectable amount of chlorine over 0.25ppm. The Call Center dispatch will then notify the WMU emergency response team and local fire department to respond to the location of the problem. WMU has yearly reviews and training on their emergency response procedures to ensure all parties are ready. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response team will perfor"

These employees are trained to operate at the \"technician level\" under the OSHA 1910.120 standard (HAZWOPER) at the level \"C\" requirement for Personal Protective Equipment.   If air monitoring results show that the concentration of chlorine is too high for the safe use of a full-face negative pressure respirator, the emergency team will seal off the area and call for the local fire department to respond.  The local fire department will oversee and conduct all response activities. If air monitoring results show that safe entry could be made (less than 5 ppm), these employees will gain entry and repair the problem. WMU has a SOP for Chlorine Leak Response Plan for failed chlorine regulators, possible leaks on one-ton cylinders of chlorine, and possible leaks on the ton cylinder or equipment in the storage room.\r\n\r\nWMU prioritizes safety and training for its employees to prevent accidents and incidents. This approach has proven to be very effective as there has been no accidents involving chlorine that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place. It is a focus at WMU to prevent accidents or incidents, improve employee training, keep up to date standard operating procedures and emergency response plans. As well as ensure all employees working with WTP system know these procedures and the steps to take in an emergency."
