A large quantity of chlorine, a highly hazardous chemical, is maintained at the facility and is used for disinfection as a part of the water treatment process. The amount of chlorine stored at the GWTP requires the City of Galax to implement and maintain a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under the Clean Air Act Section 112r(7) published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\n       The City of Galax maintains a RMP to reduce or eliminate the public and environmental consequences of an accidental hazardous chemical release from the GWTP. This RMP is a complex plan that includes hazard assessment, a formalized management system, an accident prevention program and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The City of Galax also complies with the requirements of the Process Safety of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation 40 CFR 1910.119 that requires a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that includes a water treatment process hazard analysis, employee training, contractor control, safety procedures and safety reviews for the GWTP. \n\n       The City of Galax uses the ERP as an important tool that establishes employee procedures for handling an accidental chemical release. These procedures include coordination with local emergency responders, public notification and employee measures to contain or end the chemical release. The ERP also provides for training and periodic safety reviews to ensure that the chances of an accidental chemical release are minimized.\n\n       Independent and internal audits of the RMP, PSM and ERP plans are performed periodically to make certain that the programs are updated and working as intended to reduce or eliminate an accidental chemical release from the GWTP.\n\n       There have been no accidents during the previous five years of operation of the chlorinatio"
