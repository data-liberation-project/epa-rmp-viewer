The Site occupies an approximately 132,000 square-foot structure that is located on 11.3 acres of land. The Site was originally built in 1980 and has been owned by RPC since 1985. The Site normally operates 6 days per week, 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\nThe Site manufactures doughnuts, which are frozen for shipment. The Site's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 31141 (Frozen Food Manufacturing)\r\n\r\nAs part of the refrigeration system to freeze the doughnuts for shipment, the Site handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical, as defined in the USEPA's CAPP and OSHA's PSM standard, in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Site is registered to Program Level 3 under the CAPP program.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system. The Site's engine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIn calculating the worst case release scenario, Site personnel have conservatively utilized 100 percent of the largest vessel as the amount released. However, under no circumstances is this analysis intended to indicate that Site personnel fill any vessel to this extent.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nWhile there are few long-term environmental consequences to ammonia use, it can present health hazards if handled improperly. RPC has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively).

RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\r\n\r\nThe Site has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Site's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\r\n\r\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility.

      "SummaryText": "an emergency warning system. Alarms are placed throughout the Site to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered. RPC has developed specific procedures to be followed in the event of release. These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so. RPC maintains a written emergency response plan; however, Site Associates do not currently respond to releases.\r\n\r\nAs applicable to their duties, Site personnel have received emergency response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation (29 CFR 1910.120) and other various rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Norwich Township Fire Department has visited the facility to review the process operations, safety systems and discuss emergency response coordination.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Site recognizes that the implementation of this program is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operation at the Site. As such, the prevention program will evolve as RPC continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for the employees and the surrounding community."
