      "SummaryText": "The Southwest Water Authority (SWA) is a political subdivision of the North Dakota State Water Commission established for the purpose of supplying water to the southwest region of North Dakota. The SWA delivers an estimated 3 million gallons of treated water per day to its customers.  This figure continues to rise as the SWA expands and serves a larger area. Prior to 4/1/2000, the water treatment portion of the system was owned and operated by the city of Dickinson, ND. By agreement, the water treatment is now managed and operated by the SWA.     Because of the amount of chlorine that is stored and used in the treatment process at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP), we as management-operators are required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA under 40 CRF Part 68-Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions ruling. The WTP  stores up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine and uses an average of 55 pounds of chlorine per day.   The SWA also operates a chloramination facility near Dodge, ND. The facility is located at the SWA, Dodge Pumping Station (DPS). The amount of chlorine used at this location is approx. 22 pounds per day. The chlorine stored at the DPS will at no time be greater than 2,495 pounds on any given day. Because of the amount of chlorine stored at the DPS, we as management-operators are not required to comply wth CRF Part 68. Although we are not required to comply with the ruling, we as operators have developed a process safety program for our Dodge location. The program will include chlorine safety in accordance with, but not restricted by, EPA's Risk Management Program.     The RMP requires us to formulate two chlorine release scenarios, a worst-case scenario and an alternate release scenario. For the worst-case scenario, it is presumed that a one ton chlorine container, stored in the chlorine room, empties in 10 minutes. Because of the urban topography around the WTP, it is formulated that the toxic endpoint will reach a distance of 0.9 miles in any direc"

At our DPS, considering the rural topography, it is formulated that the toxic end point will reach to a distance of 3.1 miles in any direction from the storage area.       For the altermate release scenario, we presumed that a chlorine gas regulator snapped off, allowing the containers valve to emit chlorine gas to the atmosphere through the 5/16 valve throat for 60 minutes. It is formulated that the toxic end-point for the WTP will be a radius of 0.09 miles, and for our DPS, the distance to end-point will be 0.21miles.  The SWA is in compliance with the EPA's Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA). Each year, since the reporting year of 1992, the WTP has submitted to the state and local emergency response authorities, documentation of the hazardous chemicals used and stored at both our locations.        All opeators at the WTP are trained in chlorine safety and are well versed in the operational aspects of the chlorine or chlorine / ammonia disinfection process. On-going training sessions for clorine safety as well as other safety training will be conducted on a regular basis. All operators engage in the maintenance of the chlorine process equipment and all are well informed as to the equipment mechanics, calibration and testing. The RMP is well received and will be an important addition to the safety program of the SWA.     The SWA has an excellent chlorine accident history. Our records show that there has never been a chlorine related accident involving injury or significant property damage.        In coordination with the Stark County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Dickinson Fire Department will act as the emergency response team for the WTP. In coordination with the Dunn County LEPC, the Halliday District Fire Department will act as the emergency response team for the DPS.
