      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Rembrandt facility located near Rembrandt, Iowa is an egg laying, breaking, and drying plant for distribution.   The primary purpose of this facility is to obtain eggs that are made into egg based products.  The plant has two ammonia refrigeration systems each containing less than 10,000 lbs. but are co-located and are being managed as one system.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program is in place at the plant.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.   The facility ammonia refrigeration system has been maintained and expanded in stages over the past 10 years.  The equipment reliability has not been an issue, but the expansion does provide newer equipment and the benefits associated with newer facilities. \n\n\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program. This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure equipment integrity.  A refrigeration contractor assists in maintaining the refrigeration systems and trouble shoots operating issues.  \n\n\n\nThe process has "

      "SummaryText": "numerous safeguards including:  \n\n\n\n?    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n\n\n?    Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n\n\n\n?    Most ammonia pipe isolation valves are located on the roof.   \n\n\n\n?    The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\n\n\n?    A process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n\n\n?    Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n\n\n?    The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Sioux Rapids and Rembrandt Fire Departments and other agencies involved with response.  Representatives of the Sioux Rapids Fire Department visit this plant on "
