Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of  SOUTHERN FS INC  are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local(Jonesboro) fire department and Union County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility ,which is located at 400 South Main, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of 1 - 12,000 gallon tanks, loading risres,associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia tha can be stored would be 120,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alterative-case scenario, however since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulation.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhyd"
