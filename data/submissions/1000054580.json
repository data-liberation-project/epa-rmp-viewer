      "SummaryText": "Ballinger Water Treatment Plant\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe City of Ballinger, Texas (City) operates the Ballinger Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located in Runnels County, Texas.  The Ballinger WTP produces potable water for the City of Ballinger, as well as for neighboring water supply corporations. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 12,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Ballinger WTP. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (\u00c2\u00a768.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Ballinger WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00c2\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Water Treatment Plant Superintendant (WTP Superintendant) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \n\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00c2\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Ballinger WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00c2\u00a768.42(a)).  As part"

      "SummaryText": "of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00c2\u00a768.50 & \u00c2\u00a768.58).\n\nThe Ballinger WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00c2\u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Ballinger WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Ballinger WTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Ballinger WTP.  The City of Ballinger's Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the county-wide Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00c2\u00a768.90(b))."
