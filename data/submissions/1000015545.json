This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement controls and prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nWe have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility, chlorine gas.  Chlorine gas is used in the final stage of wastewater treatment process to disinfect the effluent.  At this time the maximum inventory of chlorine gas at our facility is 5 one-ton cylinders, for a total of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have use RMP*Comp a program provided by the EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastropic release of chlorine.  The scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 3.4 mph (1.5 m/s) wind speed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from one cylinder in the chlorine process.  The scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in a gaseous form over 3.5 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all relevant standards, including: Technical Bulletin - Design Criteria for Mechanical, Electrical, and Fl"

Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains records of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"What - If\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qulaified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered process, the City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after normal turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, releif and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operations, maintenance personnel and any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set forth under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could rea"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe City of Palatka Wastewater Treament Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  All employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, the City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\nThe City of Palatka Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five (5) years.
