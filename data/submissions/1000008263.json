The HSE Department ensures that proper training is provided and documentation maintained for each contractor.  The HSSE Department also monitors contractor performance (e.g., compliance with stationary source safe work practices, knowledge of types of work and the hazards involved).  Documentation of the audits and on site evaluations is maintained for a minimum of five years.

The compilation of this information satisfies the requirements of Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation.  The five-year accident history allows MCP to explain to the community the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the onsite and offsite impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that this accidental release will not occur again.   The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against reoccurrence.  \n\nDuring the 2009 PHA and as part of this RMP/Cal-ARP updated (6/2009), certain incident investigation reports from January 1999 to present to ident"

MCP is committed to being a responsible member of the Martinez and greater Contra Costa County communities.  We place a high priority on operating our facility in a safe, healthful, and environmentally sound manner.\n\nShell requirements dictate that their facilities regularly identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials, evaluate risk, and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of process design, engineering controls, and safe work practices and procedures.  This commitment to healthly, safe, secure, and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Shell HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and The Environment) Commitment and Policy.  The MCP Risk Management Program (RMP) is incorporated into this HSSE Commitment and Policy through the MCP Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental Management System or HSSE-MS.  The MCP HSSE-MS conforms to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 requirements.  Specific Plant RMP issues are identified, evaluated, resourced, and checked via an internal action tracking tool.  These documents, as well as other related materials are readily available to all workers.\n\nMCP practically stresses safe, healthful, secure, and environmentally sound operations via an annual employee training program, monthly safety meetings, the Union-Management Health and Safety Committee and the Shell Training Awareness Recognition Team (START).   MCP has a Health, Safety, Security, And Environmental (HSSE) and Administrative Procedures Manual that comprehensively covers various aspects of management systems conformance.

Management reviews occur continually throughout the year and at least annually.\nA Description of The Martinez Catalyst Plant\nAnd The Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant consists of 2 main batch processes: Ethylene Oxide (EO) Catalyst and RM-17.  The EO Catalyst Process produces a silver-based catalyst that is sold to industrial customers that convert hydrocarbons to ethylene oxide.  A specially formulated impregnating solution is produced at the Plant and absorbed onto carrier pellets to make the EO Catalyst products. \n\nEthylenediamine (EDA), which is used in our EO Catalyst Process, is the only substance regulated by the RMP rule that is present above the EPA threshold quantity.  The total potential EDA inventory is 151,900 pounds.  Of this amount, 75,900 pounds could be present in a single tank.  The EO Catalyst Process is a Program 3 process for RMP rule compliance purposes.  \n\nAccidental Release Scenarios (Worst-Case And Alternative) For Ethylenediamine\n\nMCP has conducted offsite consequence analyses, using the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines for both the worst-case scenario (WCS), and the alternate release scenarios (ARS).  The results of MCP's analysis is described below:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for EDA at the Martinez Catalyst Plant is the release of the total contents of the 10,000-gallon (approximately 75,950 pounds) liquid storage container (Tank 390 or 391).  This scenario represents the highly unlikely release of the largest quantity of material from the largest EDA storage tank.  Pure EDA (100%) is assumed.  Only the Tank Farm A containment dike is credited as a passive mitigation measure. The results from the RMP*Comp 1.07 is 528 feet.\n\nThe population impacted by this scenario includes the Union Pacific Laydown Yard, the National Tree And Garden Company Staging Facility, the Waters Moving property, and Demolition and E"

Please note that the RMP*Comp 1.07 results appear to be the lower detection limit for this tool.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequately communicate potential acute hazards at the Martinez Catalyst Plant (MCP). Offsite consequence analysis is also a tool used by MCP to assist the CCCHSD in emergency response planning.  To do this, MCP has developed Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) as required under the CalARP Rule.  ARS results are useful for assessing the potential hazards posed by a facility and developing or assessing emergency response plans to respond to such an event.  These scenarios may be unlikely to occur, but are physically possible and reasonably feasible.\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of pure (100%) EDA at the Martinez Catalyst Plant is a 2 inch line being severed between the storage tank and the process unit.  This would result in a release of approximately 2800 pounds or 350 gallons of liquid EDA for at least 10 minutes.  Ten minutes was the time determined for the release to be detected, the system remotely isolated, and the pump shut down upon detection of the leak. This scenario was chosen through consultation with MCP Operations and Process Engineering. It is considered to be the worse credible scenario associated with the batch handling of EDA.  The results from RMP*Comp 1.07 is 528 feet.\n\nThe population impacted by this scenario includes the Union Pacific Laydown Yard, the National Tree And Garden Company Staging Facility, the Waters Moving property, and Demolition and Excavation Debris Box Services (all located on Bridgehead Road within the city limits of the City Of Martinez), part of the Tesoro AMORCO Wharf and possibly the Shell Martinez Refinery (SMR) properties."

      "SummaryText": ".  MCP has developed an incident investigation procedure that satisfies the requirements of OSHA PSM and Section 2760.9 of the CalARP regulation.  Its purpose is to investigate each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a release of EDA or any other acutely hazardous materials that could have caused personnel injury or major property damage.  Personnel identify underlying cause(s) and develop and implement corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence of the incident, or similar incidents.   A proximate cause analysis is performed for significant incidents (e.g., onsite fatality, significant offsite health effects). \n\nPlant management has stressed to employees the importance of reporting all PSM and other near-miss situations.  A PSM near miss is an incident that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release.  Employees are reminded that the proximate cause(s) of minor incidents and PSM near misses could result in major incidents if uncorrected.  Employees are encouraged to report minor incidents and PSM near misses to Supervision or HSE either verbally, in writing, or anonymously.\n\nThe Site Manager or Production Manager determines whether an incident investigation is warranted and charters a team to do the work.  MCP uses root-cause methodology and analysis and applicable employees are appropriately trained.\n\nA trained person assumes the position of incident investigation team leader when an incident occurs.  The number of and experience of the other team members is dependent upon the severity and complexity of the incident.  Typically, the incident investigation teams are comprised of a team leader, an expert in the process, and other employees (including contract employees as applicable) knowledgeable in the operation, design, and maintenance of the process. The incident investigation team leader is responsible for initiating the investigation as soon as possible, but definitely within 48 hours of the time of the incident or PSM"

This is normally done through the Contra Costa CAER organization.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant relies on the expertise of employees (including hourly and contract employees when appropriate) at all levels and disciplines to optimize operations and safety.   This is achieved by consulting with (i.e., exchanging information with, and soliciting input and participation from) personnel to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program.    MCP has therefore developed a written employee participation plan that satisfies the requirements of OSHA PSM and the requirements of Section 2760.1 of the CalARP regulation.  The written employee participation plan (available in hard copy or through the local area network computer) ensures that:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tEmployees and their representatives are consulted on the conduct and development of process hazard analyses (PHAs) conducted to comply with OSHA PSM and Section 2760.2 of the CalARP regulation.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tEmployees and their representatives are consulted on the development of all elements of the prevention program, the hazard assessment performed in accordance with OSHA PSM and Sections 2750.1 through 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation, and the emergency response program developed in accordance with Section 2765.2 of the CalARP regulation.  Examples of participation include:\n\n1.\tOperations and maintenance employees being actively involved in the development of procedures; \n\t\n2.\tOperations and maintenance employees being integral members of the established incident investigation teams; and,\n\t\n3.\tOperations and maintenance employees being consulted with regarding the appropriate type and frequency of training. \n\t\n\u00c2\u00b7\tEmployees and their representatives are provided access to PHAs, results of incident investigations"

Hard copies of meeting minutes are distributed to each employee in the field.  Meeting minutes are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\nHot Work Permits\n\nControlling ignition sources is vital to the Martinez Catalyst Plant\u00c2\u00bfs accidental release prevention program.  Therefore, it is critical that pertinent personnel are notified when hot work (i.e., any spark producing operation including use of power tools, grinding, burning, welding, brazing) is to be performed in a unit and that appropriate safety precautions are taken prior to initiation of the work. MCP has developed a hot work permit program that satisfies the requirements of OSHA PSM and Section 2760.11 of the CalARP regulation.  This program requires that employees complete permits certifying that the applicable portions of the fire prevention and protection requirements are implemented prior to beginning hot work operations.  These requirements are contained in the fire prevention and suppression procedure and hot work permit, Title 8 California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR) \u00c2\u00a74848 and \u00c2\u00a76777 respectively. \n\nThe Operations department authorizes maintenance and other work in their area and issues hot work permits for all grinding, burning, welding, and brazing performed on or near covered processes.  The hot work permit is terminated when continued use of the ignition source is hazardous, when conditions of its issuance change, or when the permitted hot work has been inactive for more than 2 hours (unless tests show that conditions are still non-hazardous). \n\nTwo copies of the hot work permit are maintained.  The first is available at the physical location of the hot work for the duration of the work.  The second is provided to the Operations Department where it is kept on file for a"

This information also includes data regarding any unique hazards that might be introduced during the course of their work. The MCP HSSE Department also updates the approved and risk-ranked contractor list annually and reviews the PICS information quarterly for red flags and other information of potential concern.\n\nField contractor employees are required to receive basic training from the Bay Area Training Consortium (BATC) before being allowed on-site.
