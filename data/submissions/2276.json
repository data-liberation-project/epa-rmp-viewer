If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel have been instructed and are prepared to work with the Caroline County Emergency personnel and the Denton Fire Department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the Denton facility of Royster-Clark, Inc. is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users (farmers).\n\nAqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored, and used from the storage tanks in the production of mixed-grade liquid fertilizer for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia stored at this facility would be 165,000 pounds in 2 - 12,000 gallon tanks each of which are located in a 6,000 square foot dike.  This would be 50,000 pounds of ammonia at the maximum of 30% ammonia content.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of Aqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia from one of the 12,000 gallon storage tanks in the diked area released as a liquid over a 411.0 minute period.  The maximum amount released would be 89,760 pounds of Aqua Ammonia which would contain 27,000 pounds ammonia at 30% maximum ammonia content.  The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of ammonia, as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degradis - and the passive mitigation of the 6,000 sq.ft. dike, is 0.46 miles.  The dike increased the release time to 411.0 minutes as apposed to 10 minutes without the dike as passive mitigation.  The release would affect 87 residents.  The possib"

      "SummaryText": "ility of this worst case release occurring is extremely unlikely as location personnel regularly inspect and repair as necessary all storage tanks.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release of Aqua Ammonia from a 3 inch transfer hose, during the unloading procedure, with the release discontinued in 1 minute.  The calculated quantity of Aqua Ammonia released would be 1500 pounds which is 450 pounds of ammonia based on the maximum of 30% ammonia content. The distance to the end point of 200 ppm of ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degradis - is 0.07 miles.    This is 370 feet and would affect no  residents.  The possibility of this alternate release scenario occurring is unlikely as Denton personnel periodically inspect, repair and replace equipment according to industry standard procedure.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release prevention program:\n\nThe Denton facility has implemented the provisions of Aqua Ammonia suppliers' recommendations for safe handling of Aqua Ammonia and appropriate OSHA regulations.  Additionally, periodic training in handling storage and use of Aqua Ammonia is done with personnel at this location.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; not, to our knowledge, have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has:\n\na. A written emergency response plan and is incorporated in the written community emergency response plan of Caroline County.\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  \nThis facilities emergency response program has been discussed with and reviewed by the Denton Fire Department.\n\n7"
