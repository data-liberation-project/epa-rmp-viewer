OxyChem is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (? 68.155(a))\n\nOxyChem has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the OxyChem Taft facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the OxyChem Taft facility.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (? 68.155(b))\n\nThe OxyChem Taft facility consists of several production units that are wholly owned by OxyChem.  OxyChem operates all units at the site.  The facility handles one substance that is regulated by the RMP rule.  This substance is Chlorine.\n \nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (? 68.155(d))\n\nThe OxyChem Taft facility?s prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nIncident Investigation\nOperating Procedures\nEmployee Participation\nKey Procedures\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nContractors\nPre-Startup Review\nCompliance Audits\nTraining\n\nEach of the items listed above are documented and maintained in manua"

These manuals are routinely updated.\n\nFive-year Accident History (? 68.155(e))\n\nThe OxyChem Taft plant has had three accidents which meet the criteria outlined in 40 CFR 68.42(a).  The largest of these releases was a 5-pound release of chlorine that affected a person off-site who received medical treatment.  In another release of 4-pounds of chlorine, personnel at a nearby industrial facility sheltered-in-place.  The third release was a release of less than 1 pound of chlorine that affected one contractor on-site.\n\nOxyChem maintains records for all accidental chemical releases and environmental incidents that occur at the Taft plant.  OxyChem conducts formal investigations to identify and correct the root causes of each event.\n\nEmergency Response Program (? 68.155(f))\n\nThe OxyChem Taft facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (?ERT?) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (?ECC?).  In addition, the OxyChem Taft facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (?SSP?) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility is a member of the St. Charles Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (?LEPC?), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (? 68.155(g))\n\nThe OxyChem Taft facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident in"
