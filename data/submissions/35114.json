      "SummaryText": "I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis document contains all of the information necessary for the MSD Grand Glaize Wastewater Treatment Facility (Grand Glaize) to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 68 ?Risk Management Program?.\n\nII. RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nGrand Glaize uses chlorine and sulphur dioxide for wastewater treatment.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant and sulphur dioxide is used to de-chlorinate the treated wastewater. Both chlorine and sulphur dioxide are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68 and are potential health hazards if not handled properly.  Grand Glaize adheres to all applicable Federal, state, and local rules and regulations to ensure a safe environment within the plant as well as for the surrounding community.  Access to the chlorine and sulphur dioxide is restricted to certified operators, authorized contractors, and the City of Valley Park Fire Department (the primary responder in the event of an accidental release).\n\nThe Grand Glaize Treatment Plant is not a primary emergency responder in the event of an accidental release, but the plant is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  Procedures are in place for notification of the Valley Park Fire Department (primary responder), the LEPC and the St. Louis County HAZMAT team.\n\nIII. PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Grand Glaize Treatment Plant in Valley Park, Missouri treats wastewater for the surrounding urban community.  Chlorine and sulphur dioxide are used in the wastewater treatment process for final effluent chlorination and de-chlorination.  The chlorination and de-chlorination process occurs during the months of April through October.  Typical consumption rates for the gases are approximately 400 pounds per day of chlorine and 250 pounds per day of sulphur dioxide.  The North American Industrial Classification System code (NAICS code) for the primary process at this facility is 22132.\n\nTypically, ten 1-ton containers of"

      "SummaryText": " chlorine and six 1-ton containers of sulphur dioxide are stored on site at any given time.  The on-line chlorination system includes four 1-ton containers in two manifolded sets of two with an automatic switchover valve between the two sets.  All full containers are housed inside the chlorination building located on the west side of the plant. Empty chlorine containers are stored in a protected area outside the chlorination building. \n\nThe on-line sulphur dioxide system consists of two 1-ton containers.  When one container is emptied, the other container is switched over manually.  Two more 1-ton containers are stored next to the two that are on-line.  All full containers are housed in a separate room within the chlorination building. \n\nThe 1-ton containers (both chlorine and sulphur dioxide) are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68.  The chlorine threshold for triggering applicability of 40 CFR 68 is 2500 pounds and the sulphur dioxide theshold is 5000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored on-site at any one time is 20,000 pounds and the maximum quantity of sulphur dioxide stored is 12,000 pounds.  Since this exceeds the threshold limit, Grand Glaize is subject to 40 CFR 68 as a Program 2 facility. \n\n\n\nIV. WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIOS\n\nIV.1       Worst-case Scenerio\nFor Grand Glaize Treatment Plant, the worst-case scenerio is the loss of 2000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes from a 1-ton container located outside of the chlorination building.  Since the facility is located in a populated area, the worst-case scenerio would affect nearby public receptors. \n\nThe chlorine worst-case scenario was developed using EPA?s RMP*COMP for distances to endpoint for chlorine.  The 3 ppm endpoint is defined by the US EPA as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level ? 2 (ERPG-2) and occurs at a distance of 1.3 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 10,000 people.  The population estimate for the worst-case scenario is based on d"

      "SummaryText": "ata generated using LandView 5 and 2000 Census data.\n\nIV.2      Alternative Release Scenerio\n\nChlorine\nThe alternative release scenario examined involves the release of chlorine due to a flashing liquid release through a 0.28? diameter rust hole at the liquid level of the 1-ton container. Passive mitigation is considered in this case as the 1-ton container is assumed to be housed in the chlorination building. The chlorine alternative release scenario was developed using EPA?s RMP*COMP to obtain the distance to endpoint.  The 3 ppm endpoint is defined by the US EPA as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level ? 2 (ERPG-2) which occurs at 0.06 miles.  According to EPA?s RMP*COMP, for distances shorter than 0.1 miles, 0.1 miles is used.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine does not impact residences (estimated affected residential population is 0 people) or environmental receptors.  Although the facility is located in an urban area, the plant is surrounded by an unpopulated, wooded buffer zone greater than 0.1 mile.\n\nSulphur Dioxide\nThe alternative release scenario examined involves the release of sulfur dioxide due to a flashing liquid release through a 0.36? diameter rust hole at the liquid level of the 1-ton container. Passive mitigation is considered in this case as the 1-ton container is assumed to be housed in the chlorination building. The sulfur dioxide alternative release scenario was developed using EPA?s RMP*COMP software for predicting distances to toxic endpoint for sulfur dioxide in the Alternative Case Scenario. The 3 ppm endpoint is defined by the US EPA as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level ? 2 (ERPG-2) which occurs at 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide does not impact residences (estimated affected residential population is 0 people) or environmental receptors.

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all Federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The plant continually conducts inspections to ensure the system is intact and operating correctly.  These inspections ensure that the worst-case and alternative scenerios have a minimal chance of occurring. \n\nThe plant has developed a prevention program for chlorine and sulphur dioxide to meet the Program 2 requirements of the RMP rule.  The prevention program was developed to comply with 40 CFR 68, to ensure the safety of the employees, and to ensure the safety of the surrounding community.  The program covers a compilation of safety information, periodic conduct of hazard reviews, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance auditing and incident investigation. \n   \nVI.      FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of this facility?s accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1999 ? June 21, 2004.  \n\nDuring this time period, on April 4, 2002, one minor release was reported. An incident report was filed for a leaking chlorinated-water underground pipe.  An RQ release occurred and an EPA Incident Report was completed, however, no exposure concerns resulted since the chlorine was hydrolyzed in water and the leak was underground.  The leak was repaired and the new PVC piping installation improved with a case iron liner.\n\n\nVII.     EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n As mentioned earlier, in Section 1.0, the Grand Glaize Treatment Plant is not a primary emergency responder in the event of an accidental release, but the plant is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  Procedures are in place for notification of the Valley Park Fire Department (primary responder), the LEPC and the St. Louis County HAZMAT team.  The Valley Park Fire Department is notified by calling 911.\n\nVIII. PLANN"
