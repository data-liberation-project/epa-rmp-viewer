      "SummaryText": "C& F packing is located at 515 Park Avenue, Lake Villa, Illinois. The facility packages meat products. The packaged products are refrigerated in large coolers using an ammonia refrigeration system (ARS). Anhydrous ammonia has been used as a refrigerant by the food industry for decades. An ARS contains ammonia in various states including liquid, vapor and gas in various vessels, compressors, condensers, pipes and evaporators. The refrigeration system in this facility contains approximately 24,500 pounds of ammonia inventory for this process. We follow the federally required process safety management program (29 CFR 1910.119) to prevent anhydrous ammonia leaks and other refrigeration system accidents. We coordinate our emergency plans with Lake Villa Volunteer Fire Department and local police department through an offsite emergency plan, onsite tours, and discussion. Alternative and worse case release scenarios have been completed for anhydrous ammonia. Contact us if you would like to review or discuss these scenarios or nay other concern you have. No ammonia leaks that are reportable under the EPA's Risk management regulation (40 CFR 68.42) have occurred in the last five years. We are continuously reviewing and upgrading our safety, health, and environmental programs."
