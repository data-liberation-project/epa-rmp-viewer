Pure Water Pool Service has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1999.\n\nPure Water Pool Service's president is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The president administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1999.  The process is located at 5012A Salida Blvd., Salida, California 95368.  The chlorine system for Pure Water Pool Service consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is drawn from the ton container to 20 pound cylinders.  Below provides a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\nChlorine Tanks (one ton containers)\n(2 - Operational and Maximum Amount)\n\nFilling Manifold\n\nScrubber System\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site for the Pure Water Pool Service is 4,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPure Water Pool Service has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conju"

The area is secured with crash posts and the ton containers are secured to stands in case of an earthquake.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Addendum (April 2004) the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there have been no reportable releases of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Pure Water Pool Service's action plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Pure Water Pool Service has a B-kit available at the facility for the HAZMAT team's use in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPure Water Pool Service has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (May 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (April 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the audit will be completed by December 2004.  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
