Our chlorination room houses a maximum of four 1-ton cylinders of chlorine (8000 lbs).  Disinfection of the plant effluent is now required year-round so the plantA?s chlorination systems now operate continuously, 365 days per year. There are normally two 1-ton cylinders on-line. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention \nOur plant safety program includes formalized staff training on proper cylinder changing procedures and proper emergency response actions in the event of an uncontrolled release of chlorine gas.  In the event of an uncontrolled release of chlorine our WWTP staff has been instructed to immediately exit the chlorine room, shut off all ventilation fans to help contain any chlorine within the room, and contact the Bozeman Fire Department at 911 who will dispatch their Hazmat Team.  The plantA?s Emergency Action Plan provides specific details on plant evacuation routes & procedures, and identifies two designated areas for assembly of all personnel following an evacuation. \n\nEmergency Response Program \nThe Bozeman Fire Department employs a full-time staff of firefighters who are trained in Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) response procedures.  In the event of an emergency at the WWTP the Bozeman Hazmat Team will be dispatched by calling 911.  This team is fully equipped with proper Class A protective gear and Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus. The Bozeman Fire Department and Hazmat team conducts annual on-site chlorine training exercises at the Bozeman WWTP.  The date of their most recent on-site training was 4/11/2009.\n\nGeneral Safety Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \nThe chlorination facilities at the Bozeman WWTP are equip"

All safety wrenches and tools necessary to safely change a 1-ton cylinder. \nD.  An audible chlorine alarm system to alert the WWTP staff of any leak. \nE.  SCADA interlocks which annunciate all chlorine alarm conditions and notify \n      plant personnel via cell phones on a 24-hour basis if the plant is unattended.\nF.  Panic hardware on all exit doors to facilitate rapid escape. \nG. Two ventilation fan systems. \nH. Two Hydro cylinder-mounted vacuum regulators that stop the release of     \n     chlorine in the event of a vacuum leak. \nI. A wind sock to display the prevailing wind direction at all times.\nJ.  A certified and inspected 2-ton cylinder hoist. \nK.  Proper cylinder changing procedures and emergency phone contacts posted     \n     on the wall of the chlorine room. \nL.  Face shields and chemical safety goggles. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no reportable chlorine incidents within the last 5 years.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Bozeman WWTP is actively taking steps to eliminate the use of chlorine gas and change our primary means of disinfection within the next 18 months.  HDR Engineering has completed the design of a new ultra-violet (UV) disinfection system for the Bozeman WWTP and Williams Bros Construction has been awarded this contract.  Construction of our new UV disinfection structure has begun and we anticipate completion in 2010.  The installation of this UV disinfection system will eliminate the need to store and use 1-ton cylinders of chlorine gas at the Bozeman WWTP.  When this plant modification is completed we will notify the EPA and file a request to be de-registered and removed from the RMP database of active facilities.\n\n\nPrepared by: \nJ.
