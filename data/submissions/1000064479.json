Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Long Island, LLC are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Central Islip Fire Dept., who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on Process/operational requirements, is 20,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.
