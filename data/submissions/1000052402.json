The EH&S Manager reports directly to the president of the TRCC, allowing the EH&S Manager to make environmental issues an integral part of company operations.\n\n\n\nTiarco Facility & Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nTiarco is a specialty chemical manufacturer operating both chemical reaction processes and chemical blending processes. Tiarco uses the following RMP regulated substances:  carbon disulfide (75-15-0); dimethylamine (124-40-3); and monomethylamine (74-89-5). In addition, Tiarco uses diethylamine (109-98-7) and isopropyl alcohol (67-63-0) which are regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management program. All five of these chemicals are stored in bulk quantities in stationary storage tanks. All of the processes and chemicals produced using the RMP regulated substances are known as carbamates.\n\n\n\nTiarco is located in Dalton, Georgia and is part of a larger collection of TRCC plants located on a single campus. Tiarco employs approximately 24 people. The total employment at the Dalton campus is approximately 230.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nTiarco complies with both the EPA's Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management. Both of these regulatory programs include detailed requirements addressing areas such as process safety information, hazard assessment, mechanical integrity, contractor safety, operating procedures, management of change, and incident investigation.
