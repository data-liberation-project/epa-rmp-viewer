New concrete storage tank unloading pad with active mitigation was also installed to facilitate direct loading of the new storage tank.  The enhancements requried a new PHA and the RMP was updated per 40 CFR 68.190(b)(5).  The new process equipment is reflected in the \"piperidine storage modification\" scenario.  A smaller vessel without secondary containment with a 12,000 liter volume is modelled as the worst case scenario.  A loading pad transfer hose leak without active mitigation was modelled as the alternative scenario.",

      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\n1.0 RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nRoche Colorado Corporation currently uses Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated chemicals below threshold quantities with the exception of Piperidine and Titanium Tetrachloride. Roche Colorado Corporation has evaluated the requirements of the RMP rule and has reviewed present emergency management practices.  Roche Colorado Corporation has determined that current practices meet or exceed the requirements of RMP. \n\nRoche Colorado Corporation is a member of the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care? program. Responsible Care? consists of a comprehensive management system designed to address risks associated with the handling of chemicals.  Moreover, Roche Colorado Corporation has an extensive process safety management program designed to satisfy all of Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management program requirements and the RMP.  Roche Colorado Corporation is dedicated to working with the community emergency response authorities to address the potential for releases that could affect the public.  Roche Colorado Corporation employs physical and administrative controls to mitigate potential releases.  Roche Colorado Corporation implements extensive internal training to prevent releases as well as prepare for eventualities which may result from releases.  Roche Colorado Corporation is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and endeavors to prepare the LEPC for the possibility of responding to releases that could originate from Roche Colorado Corporation. \n\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nRoche Colorado Corporation has two regulated substances under 40 CFR 68 that exceed the plan threshold: piperidine and titanium tetrachloride.  \n\nPiperidine:  Roche Colorado Corporation uses piperidine (CAS #110-89-4) in the production of pharmaceutical intermediates, and in performing "

      "SummaryText": "research and development of new and/or improved pharmaceutical processes.  Specifically, piperidine is used in the production of anti-HIV/AIDs pharmaceuticals.  Pharmaceuticals are primarily produced via synthesis routes involving organic chemicals.  \n\nPiperidine is an organic chemical used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals.  The piperidine threshold for triggering applicability of 40 CFR 68 is 15,000 pounds per process.  The main process vessel containing piperidine has a worst case capacity greater than 15,000 pounds.\n\nPiperidine is a chemical with a pungent odor that is readily detectable below concentrations of concern.  The odor is described in literature as amine-like, heavy, sweet, floral, animal odor, odor of pepper.  Due to the odor, exposed persons will not voluntarily stay in areas of even low concentrations.  Little data regarding exposure limits is available in the literature, however Roche Colorado Corporation has been advised by expert toxicologist's to consider the following concentrations for emergency response planning purposes:\n    \n    1 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration for up to one hour without experiencing other than mild, transient adverse health effects or without perceiving a clearly defined objectionable odor. \n\n    10-100 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration range for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\n    100-1000 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration range for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.\n\nAnticipated health effects are acute irritation/toxicity including skin irritation, corrosive effect on human tissue, nausea.  \n\nTitanium Tetrachloride:  In July, 2004, RCC will begi"

      "SummaryText": "n manufacturing a new pharmaceutical intermediate.  Titanium tetrachloride (CAS#7550-45-0) will be used in quantities in excess of the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The titanium tetrachloride will be received at the site warehouse as a liquid in steel cylinders containing approximately 1,500 pounds of titanium tetrachloride per cylinder.  During the manufacturing campaign, one cylinder will be in process in a process containment booth in the production building.\n\nThe cylinders of titanium tetrachloride will be transported individually via delivery truck to the production building where the material will be stored in a containment booth.  Based on the manufacturing procedure, the appropriate amount of material will be charged directly from the cylinders to the process feed tank.  Methylene chloride will be added to the titanium tetrachloride in the process feed tank.  This process solution will then be charged to the process reactor vessel where the solution will react with other compounds in the vessel and produce the desired pharmaceutical intermediate compound.  The cylinder, process feed tank, and process reactor vessel are closely monitored during processing.  High level alarms and shutoff controls are used in the event process parameters exceed predetermined set points.   Each production unit includes an emergency stop, which enables a complete shutdown of the process to a fail-safe state.\n\nTitanium tetrachloride Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPG?s) are as follows (per American Industrial Hygiene Association Press, 1992):\n\nERPG-1:  5 mg/m3, The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing other than mild, transient adverse health effects or without perceiving a clearly defined objectionable odor.\n\nERPG-2:  20 mg/m3, The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without"

The EPA has said that a process in compliance with OSHA PSM is also in compliance with RMP program level 3.  The processes containing piperidine and titanium tetrachloride at Roche Colorado Corporation are RMP program level 3.  All elements of OSHA PSM have been implemented for the piperidine and titanium tetrachloride containing processes.\n\nKey aspects of the PSM program include: process safety information reviews, process hazard analysis, operating procedure documentation and review, class room and on-hands training prior to system operation, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre-startup reviews, incident investigation, routine compliance audits, hot work permit program, contractor qualification, and employee participation in process safety reviews.\n\n4.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving RMP regulated chemicals in the last five years that have affected offsite receptors or have resulted in significant loss of property or injury of personnel.\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nRoche Colorado Corporation has a comprehensive emergency response plan that addresses employee, contractor and public safety.  Moreover, Roche Colorado Corporation is committed to the protection of both its employees and the public.\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRoche Colorado Corporation has a proactive incident investigation program that acts as a c"
