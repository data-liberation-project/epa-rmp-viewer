(Hollister Facility) are committed to safe operations and prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of an accidental release, the facility will work with local Fire Departments, the LEPC, and Emergency Management Coordinator to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of a release on the community and the environment.\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n     The primary function of the Facility is the storage and retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers in the surrounding area.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored on-site at this facility would be 84,118 lbs in the 18,000 gallon capacity tank (based on 56% filling density).\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:\n     The worst-case scenario would be the release of 84,118 lbs of toxic gas in 10 minutes; discharge rate would be 8,412 lbs/minute.  Distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.27 miles, using the DEGADIS Model, and assuming \"agricultural\" terrain.  Affected population is estimated to be 60 people (all of Hollister, plus 4 rural residences).\n     The Alternative Scenario would be the release of 5,954 lbs/minute for 2 minutes, based on transfer hose failure; distance to the toxic endpoint would be .60 miles, using the DEGADIS Model, and assuming \"agricultural\" terrain.  Affected population is estimated to be 56 people (all of Hollister, plus 2 rural residences). \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n     This facility has implemented and is in compliance with all provisions of 40 CFR Part 68; ANSI K-61.1; 29 CFR 1910.111; 40 CFR PART 355; and 29 CFR 1910.38.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that have (a) caused any deaths or significant property damage at the facility nor (b) to our knowledge, have resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuatio"

The Facility has provided the LEPC and other planning agencies and authorities the emergency planning information for incorporation into other local emergency response plans, as required in SARA Title III.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n     Safety improvement is a major priority at this facility; routine and periodic evaluations determine the status of working conditions, and identify possible changes needed for incorporation.  There are currently no changes identified for implementation specific to this process, i.e. retail sale of Nitrogen Fertilizer.\n     Discussion of Safety Issues, provision of latest regulatory information, and group interaction relative to any areas of concern are incorporated into monthly safety meetings as well as training sessions."
