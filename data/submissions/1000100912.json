The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response at the site is coordinated with the Clinton County Department of Emergency Services (DES), which is accomplished through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives to foster improved relations between Croda and local emergency response groups.  The site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCroda, Inc. believes strongly in continuous improvement and is always looking for opportunities to improve the safety of the plant.  Recommendations from Process Hazard Analyses, Incident Investigations, Compliance Audits, etc. are continuously incorporated into existing operations.\r\n\r\nFuture safety improvements include:\r\n\r\n-Replacement of existing methyl chloride thermal oxidizer with a new regenerative thermal oxidizer\r\n-Upgrades to fixed gas detection systems\r\n-Expansion of safety instrumented functions on reactors that use ethylene oxide and propylene oxide\r\n-Continuous evaluation and implementation of additional safeguards on reactor systems and bulk storage systems that utilize ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, methyl chloride, and epichlorohydrin"
