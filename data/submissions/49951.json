The approximate total quantity of ammonia in the system is 21,050 lbs.  ISA has been operating in Kodiak since 1980.  ISA is a wholly owned subsidiary of True World Holdings LLC.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention - To insure safe operation & prevention of accidental releases this faciilty complies with OSHA's PSM & with EPA's RMP programs, includng appropriate implementation of emergency action & emergency response plans.  All safety personnel & system operators are trained in these operating & emergency procesures to insure the mechanical integrity of the system & the health & safety of our on-site employees & the off-site public & environmental receptors.  The system uses standard materials & components, as well as standard engineering, manufacture, & industry guidelines to provide overlapping layers of protection & release detection.  The general accidental release prevention program includes extensive automatic & manual correction components integrated throughout the system.\n\nWorst-Case Accidental Release Scenario - The greatest release of ammonia would likely occur if the liquid fill line pipe from the high pressure receiver (HPR) to the low pressure receiver (LPR) were to break.  It is estimated that only a catastrophic event, such as a major earthquake or tsunami, would be the cause of this scenario.  In this scenario the liquid would be forced out of the bottom of the HPR, emptying the receiver in a matter of seconds.  The estimated release could be up to 8,250 lbs., depending on the level of use of the overall system at the time of the event.  The estimated release end-point would be approximately 1/2 mile from the plant, according to EPA models for RMP specific to ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - If the similar fill line pipe on the LPR were to break, building pressure could cause the release of gas"

      "SummaryText": " that would boil-off.  Left uncontrolled, this scenario could release approximately 8,250 lbs., though this release would be at a much slower rate than the Worst-Case Scenario & could take up to several hours for full release.\n\nAdditional Information - No on-site or off-site accidental release resulting in injury, death, property, or environmental damage occurred during the past five years.\n\nThe company's emergency response program, safety protocols, PSM, & RMP are constantly reviewed for improvement.  The company coordinates these efforts with the local fire department, LEPC, & other seafood processors in Kodiak.  As well, the company actively participated with other Alaska industry partners & regulatory agency partners on an OSHA Strategic Partnership (OSP) to develop PSM compliance guidelines specific to seafood processors using ammonia refrigeration systems."
