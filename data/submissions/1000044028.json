The Ultraviolet Disinfection process is scheduled to be complete and on-line in July of 2014, at which point, chlorine will no longer be used or stored in the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE FACILITY?\r\n\r\n\tThe Veolia Water North America approach to chemical safety at the Great Falls plant has always been first and foremost to be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, but being in compliance does not ensure that accidents will not occur. We have stressed this fact repeatedly to the employees of this facility.  They have been involved extensively in writing and reviewing all plant specific policies relating to chemical safety.  These policies are written to provide the utmost safety for plant personnel.  Employees are instructed from the point of orientation that these policies are to be followed implicitly and any deviations or exceptions to these policies are not allowed. Training on chemical processes and SOP's is completed as required by OSHA and VWNA Corporate and stands to reinforce the importance of safe chemical handling.\r\n\r\nAt the senior management level, the Veolia Water North America Safety and Environmental Compliance Mission is as follows:\r\n\r\nVWNA will not compromise accident and injury prevention, or environmental protection compliance for profit or production.  Its guiding principles are:\r\n\r\n-  An uncompromising commitment to safety, environment and regulatory compliance from management and each employee is the key to achieving our mission and goal.\r\n-  All employees have the right - and responsibility - to immediately halt and report unsafe or non-compliant equipment, acts, or practices.  Management support of this policy is total and absolute.\r\n-  VWNA strives to"

      "SummaryText": "e Great Falls Wastewater Treatment Plant is a Secondary Activated Sludge Treatment Facility, treating primarily domestic waste.  The plant is rated at 21 million gallons per day but treats an average of 10.0 MGD of wastewater.  Chlorine, the only regulated substance in the facility, is used to disinfect the final effluent during the months April thru October.  By permit, we are not required to chlorinate the other five months of the year.  We currently use on average about 120 lbs of gaseous chlorine per day when chlorinating.  The maximum amount of chlorine that we can have in the facility is 18,000 lbs.; 6000 lbs on the scale and 12,000 lbs on the loading/storage dock.  The actual amount in the facility on a day to day basis is usually < 10,000 as our supplier attempts to limit total cylinders (empty or full) in the plant to five. \r\n\tChlorine can also be used in the process to control filamentous bacterial growth in the aeration basins.  These bacteria inhibit the settling characteristics of the sludge, which in turn can cause solids washout to the effluent.  This method of control is an option but is used infrequently.  \r\n        As stated above, in July of 2014, chlorine will no longer be used for disinfection as a project is underway to convert the chlorine disinfection process to Ultraviolet Disinfection.  Filamentous control of the process will be conducted using liquid sodium hypochlorite which will be brought into the facility on an as-needed basis. \r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\tBecause the Great Falls Facility is operated by a private firm, VWNA, it falls under The OSHA Rule for Chemical Process Safety Management, 20 CFR 1910.119.  \r\n\t\r\n        At the local level, we are very confident that our overall accident prevention program is effective. Specific practices here at the plant that contributes to the effectiveness of the chlorine release program are:\r\n\t\r\nPreventive maintenance tasks of the chlorine system that inc"

Countless hours continue to be allotted to safety for meetings, training, tailgate sessions, safety inspections, correction of hazards, policy review and updating, in addition to the time it takes to administer the program itself.  \r\n\tVWNA managers at the plant not only allot the time necessary for a successful program but also participate in the program as well.  All safety meetings are attended by plant management staff and involve all on-duty employees.  Managers monitor the activity of the committee outside the meetings as well. \r\n\tVWNA requires its employees to complete a respirometry questionnaire yearly and  pays for testing if required by the company physician.  In addition, Hepatitis B vaccinations were offered and all potentially affected employees took advantage of the program.\r\n\tVWNA provides several incentives to its employees for working safely.  For each year of no lost time accidents a safety dinner is provided and a monetary bonus is provided as well.  At VWNA Great Falls, since 1977, there have been 23 awards for working a year without a lost time accident and employees are currently approaching ten years without a lost time accident and six years without a recordable incident.\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FACILITY\r\n\r\n\tTh"

      "SummaryText": "response plan addresses general emergency events, as well as 1 ton chlorine cylinder leaks, which is the most likely critical emergency at the Great Falls Wastewater Treatment Plant.\r\n\tCoordination with local emergency responders has been considerable.  On June 11, 1998, an emergency response simulation was held at the plant.  Planning for the emergency simulation was done jointly with the Great  Falls Fire Department, the primary responder in a chlorine leak situation.  The exercise involved simulation of a major chlorine leak from a one ton cylinder at the plant site.  Other entities participating in the response simulation were Malmstrom Air Force Base and Montana Air National Guard emergency response personnel.  The local director of the Cascade County Disaster and Emergency Services also took part in the Exercise.  \r\n\tTraining on emergency response is conducted on a yearly basis.  This training involves an actual simulated emergency response situation every other year.  In the year we do not conduct a simulation, classroom training is held.  In the classroom, the entire emergency response plan is reviewed with particular attention given to the chlorine leak response section.\r\n\tAppendix E of the Great Falls Emergency Response Plan is entitled Emergency Release Reporting Standard Operating Procedures.  It discusses in detail the situations requiring reporting, which agencies to report to and provides a Release Notification Form to be used to assist in accurate and timely reporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nAs stated above, chlorine disinfection is being converted to Ultraviolet Disinfection.  The conversion is scheduled for completion in July of 2014.\r\n\r\n Design and installation of two new anaerobic digesters and centrifuges to dewater was completed in 2003, eliminating and old and worn out wet air oxidation system.
