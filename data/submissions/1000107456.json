(Ovintiv) is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Ovintiv is considered a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nOvintiv owns and operates a gas plant located in Lamesa, Texas. The gas plant stores compressed natural gas (CNG) that is a flammable mixture containing the following RMP-regulated flammables in excess of the EPA RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs: \n\n  -  Butane (CAS#106-97-8),\n  -  Isobutane (CAS# 75-28-5),\n  -  Methane (CAS# 74-82-8),\n  -  Ethane (CAS# 74-84-0),\n  -  Propane (CAS#74-98-6),\n  -  Pentane (CAS# 109-66-0) and,\n  -  Isopentane (CAS# 78-78-4).\n\nThis plant is unmanned and will be visited as needed by leased operators. \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe Ovintiv CNG plant is not required to implement the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations because they are eligible for RMP Program Level 1. However, Ovintiv has safety systems in place to identify and control the hazards in the process and to keep employees and the public safe.\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe CNG plant is a new facility and therefore has not had any accidents.\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nAs a non-responding site, Ovintiv has developed a written emergency action plan (EAP) that includes activation of the local emergency notification sys"

All employees are trained to assist other employees in a safe and orderly evacuation. Should the scope of any incident exceed the capability of staff, such as a large flammable gas release, fire, or explosion at the facility, the employee discovering emergency shall follow the protocol provided in the EAP to notify facility personnel, isolate the covered process if safe to do so, evacuate the facility and perform headcount at the designated muster point, and contact emergency responders. Emergency exit routes are through any available gate for this outdoor location and muster points. The facility is a non-responding facility and relies on the Martin County Office of Emergency Management when necessary to respond to RMP chemical releases.\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nOvintiv are continually improving and implementing their safety systems as the startup and operate the new CNG facility. Ovintiv has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility. We believe that, due to the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation and our commitment to continuous improvement, an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to occur."
