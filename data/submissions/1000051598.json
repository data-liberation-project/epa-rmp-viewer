(CDPI) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is the basis of having a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with all processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls, both engineering and administrative, to prevent possible releases of not only regulated substances, but all potentially hazardous materials. If such a release were to occur, we are prepared to work closely with the local Emergency Response agencies such as the Fire Departments and LEPCs in providing trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nFacility Overview\n\nChemDesign Products, Inc (CDPI) is a custom manufacturer of a wide variety of fine organic chemicals with the end uses of our products many and varied.  It offers a broad range of manufacturing flexibility for its customers and produces materials for the paper, electronics, agricultural and other industries.  Sales are worldwide.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nMethyl Chloride\n\nChemdesign receives methyl chloride from bulk trucks, which are off loaded directly into our methyl chloride bulk tank system.  Inventory control requires that less than 20,000 pounds remain in inventory before a shipment is received.  The maximum load on a bulk truck of methyl chloride is 40,000 pounds resulting in a maximum on-site inventory of 60,000 pounds.  The bulk tank is designed for pressure storage with extra thick walled construction and double weld seams.  Due to the evaporative nature of this material, no dike or"

      "SummaryText": " containment walls exist at this tank.  The worst case scenario is the release of the entire contents of the full tank (60,000 pounds) over ten minutes.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenarios\n\nMethyl Chloride\n\nMethyl chloride is charged to the process through the use of a \"day tank\" or staging pressure vessel.  This vessel holds enough material for one reaction.  This reduces the amount of potential release in the event of an upset condition.  The \"day tank\" is protected by a rupture disk and then a re-seating pressure release valve.  The tank vents back to the bulk tank when filling. This tank offers the most possible alternative case scenario.  In the event the vent line were not completely open the day tank could over pressurize and rupture the burst disk.  The pressure release valve would in turn open, relieve the pressure and then re-seat in about 3 seconds releasing about 25 pounds.  The material would flow to the pressure containment tank and release the contents to the atmosphere through a controlled point.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride will be received as a liquid via isotainer.  The liquid titanium tetrachloride isotainer will serve as the supply source for charging directly into a 2000 gallon vessel. The isotainer can only be transferred to a vessel with the use of 25 psi.  The reaction will be done under blocked in conditions to ensure full conversion of titanium tetrachloride to the desired product prior to venting off the reactor to the caustic scrubber prior to work up and isolation. The worst case scenario is a complete loss of contents of the isotainer into a building.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCDPI is located on the border of two states and as such believe we have a responsibility to ensure the safety our staff members, our community and the environment from upset conditions should they occur at our operations.  We are active members of both states' (Counties) Local Emergency Planning Committees.  We also w"

      "SummaryText": "ork closely with the two Fire Departments both for training as well as drilling purposes.  The City and County have detailed emergency notification systems and our internal Contingency Plan clearly outlines our means of communicating with these organizations.  We have both a detailed Contingency Plan detailing our response mechanisms for any type of situation and an Off-Site Plan filed with the State detailing our capabilities for offsite assistance. The Marinette Fire Department is located less 2 miles from our site with a response time of less than five minutes.  CDPI is very proud of our working relationship with the local Emergency Responders and provides yearly tours and training opportunities for all local response agencies. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n\n\nCDPI is constantly looking to discover new and better ways to enhance our safety programs.  We are currently engaged in an active one-on-one dialogue between all personnel and top management to determine how we can further increase the effectiveness of our safety and environmental programs.  Active safety, regulatory and technical training is provided to all personnel on a monthly basis with specialized, process specific training given on a more frequent as needs dictate basis. Safety, whether employee safety, environmental safety or process safety is integral to the way ChemDesign Products does business.  \n\n\n\n"
