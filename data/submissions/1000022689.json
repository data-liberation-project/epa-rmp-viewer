The facility employees are involved in reviewing the PSM Program.  Clark County School District has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia physical and health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated annually to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Clark County School District Food Service Department took ownership of the facility in early 2006.  The Clark County School District facility is located at 6350 E. Tropical Parkway in Las Vegas, Nevada between Interstate 15 and North Las Vegas Boulevard.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with sparse commercial/industrial buildings as well as some residential areas.  Ammonia equipment is located in the machine room, on the machine room roof, and throughout the dock, cooler, dry storage, and freezer areas.  Ammonia sensors are located in rooms where refrigeration equipment is present in order to provide a warning of an ammonia gas leak.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process and is the only regulated substance on site.\n\nThe maximum intended ammonia inventory is 15,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Clark County School District"

      "SummaryText": "Food Service Department ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.  The Clark County School District Food Service Department utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to maintain the refrigeration system equipment.\n\nGiven the presence of anhydrous ammonia, The Clark County School District Food Service Department has in place a Process Safety Management program to ensure the safety of employees and the general public in the vicinity.  This program addresses items related to the operation of ammonia based refrigeration systems including but not limited to the handling of the chemical, operator training, equipment selection and maintenance, contractor qualifications, preventative maintenance programs, routine and emergency operating procedures and emergency planning and response.  The Clark County School District Food Service Department also has an emergency action plan in effect, which is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries and illnesses.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nAmmonia has a strong pungent odor which is detectable at very low concentration levels when released to the atmosphere.  The refrigeration system is designed such that"

Ammonia is detectable by its odor at levels well below that which will raise health concerns.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince The Clark County School District Food Service Department assumed ownership of the facility in early 2006, the facility has not had an accidental release of ammonia causing personnel injury or with off site consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Clark County School District Food Service Department has an Emergency Action Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations.  This Plan outlines the policies and procedures in place to respond to potential ammonia alarms or releases.  The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.  \n\nThe Action Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations includes the facility emergency coordinators, the staff alerting list, emergency notification list, and the hazardous material agency notification and procedures.  This Plan then proceeds to detail the procedures for employees and management in the event of a fire, evacuation, compressor room shut down, blackout, and ammonia release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Clark County School District Food Service Department will continue to provide annual emergency notification, evacuation and employee accountability training for all personnel on  an annual basis.\n\nThe Clark County School District Food Service Department will also continue to schedule annual emergency planning and training site visits with the North Las Vegas fire Department and the City of Las Vegas Hazmat Team.\n\nThe Clark County School District Food Service Department Process Safety Management Committee will continue to review the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plans on an annual basis."
