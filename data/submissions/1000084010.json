Following is a description of some of these safety features.\r\n-Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant. They are maintained monthly and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor.\r\n- Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shutdown the Plant and isolate the process.

Excess CO2 is removed via the amine system, A302dried and then to a HYCO Cold Box for partial oxidation and cryogenic separation and purification of CO.  The Hydrogen from the Cold Box is delivered to the Pressure Swing Adsorption Unit where it is further purified, compressed and sent to the customer.  The CO from the Cold Box is compressed and sent to the customer.
