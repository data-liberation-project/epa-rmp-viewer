Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of AgVantage FS Inc. are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release \nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Grundy Center Fire Department, Grundy County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any \nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 1001 A Ave., Grundy Center, IA is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of storage tank(s), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history. \n\nThe following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that have occurred at \nthe facility:\n\n- We had an accidental release of 3,050 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on 4/9/04 as a result of a broken valve stem.  \"A\" Avenue was closed for less than an hour, no evacuations or shelter is place was necessary.                                                            \n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-\nknow infor"

Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire \ndepartment and LEPC.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety. \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are \nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety \nrecommendations for implementation at this time."
