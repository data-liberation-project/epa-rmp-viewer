Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Corsicana Technologies, Inc., Corsicana Plant, has always had a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe working environment. This policy is consistent with both the spirit and the intent of our commitment.  The safety of employees, company operations, and the public are management's most important complete compliance with all safety regulations and safety policies.\n\nEvery attempt will be made to reduce the possibility of accident occurrence by all levels of management.  Corsicana believes that safety, like quality and housekeeping, can be controlled by motivated supervision.  Therefore, preventable lost time accidents will have an impact on a supervisor's annual salary review, including any bonuses and incentive plans.  Unreported accidents will be considered falsification of company records and will result in immediate discharge.  Lost time accident free locations will be eligible for annual awards.\n\n2.  The Station Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nCorsicana operates a specialty chemical plant and manufactures fatty amines and nitrile intermediates.  The principal products are emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, de-emulsifiers, and surfactants.\n\nWe have eight regulated substances present at our facility as raw materials for processes, which include dimethylamine (DMA), acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen, formaldehyde, methyl chloride (MeCl), epichlorohydrin, and trimethylamine (TMA).  Acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, epichlorohydrin, and methyl chloride are regulated as toxic chemicals and trimethylamine, hydrogen, and dimethylamine are regulated as flammable chemicals.\n\n \n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out"

A number of processes at our facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) Processes Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCorsicana maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of the information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. Corsicana primarily uses the checklist and HAZOP method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nFor the purposes of safety conducting activities within our covered processes, Corsicana maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCorsicana conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and are conducted at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are documented in a report.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner and are also documented.  The facility will maintain the two most recent compliance audit reports.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCorsicana promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours after the incident, and will involve at least one person knowledgeable of the process involved.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  A report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and will include any resolutions and corrective action.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCorsicana believes that PSM and accidental prevention are a team effort.
