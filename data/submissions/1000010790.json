Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of AgVantage FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Waukon Fire Department, Allamakee County Local Emergency Planning Committee  or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 718 9th St. NW, Waukon, IA. Is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of storage tank(s), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\n\n5. Five year accident history. \n  \nOn Thursday evening 5/10/07 around 7:00pm, our employees at Waukon saw the local police and Fire Dept. come onto our property. They were responding to a call of an NH3 release at our facility. Our employees were unaware of any release. Upon investigation, the vapor valve on one tank had worked open and a hissing could be heard. Tightening the valve corrected the problem. This was witnessed by the Fire Dept. Because the release was not of reportable quantity, they didn't feel a need to call our 24-hour emergency\nphone. They were not aware of any evacuation, nor were they aware that the Fire Dept. had advised a neighbor (with 2 asthmatic children) to leave their house. I did not become aware of this until Friday morning (5/11) when I had conversation with Kathy Lee at 10:50am. It has been reiterated with our employees the importance of contacting our 24-hour emergency phone in a spill or release event and/or a response call by local emergency personnel. We also made clear that all valves on all tanks need to be checked daily to help prevent valves from working open.\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Waukon Fire Department and the Allamakee Co.  LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.  \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
