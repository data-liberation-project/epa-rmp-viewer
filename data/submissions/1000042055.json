The treatment facilities are located on a land area of approximately 39 acres, bounded on the southwest by the Pomona (60) Freeway, on the southeast side by Workman Mill Road, on the northeast side by the San Jose Creek Channel, and on the northwest side by the San Gabriel River.  \r\n\r\nCSDLAC has operated the SJCWRP facility since inception in 1971.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages, from an original capacity of 37.5 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) to the current capacity of 100 mgd.  The wastewater treated at SJCWRP originates mainly from approximately 1,000,000 domestic users in the San Gabriel Valley region; a small fraction is of industrial origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with aqueous ammonia addition, chlorination, and dechlorination to yield a tertiary effluent that is suitable for re-use.  Aqueous ammonia (19.5% concentration) is used in the disinfection process. \r\n \r\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY COMPONENTS\r\n\r\nStoring and handling large quantities of aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  For this reason, SJCWRP follows all industry recommended practices for safely storing and handling these chemicals.  SJCWRP's aqueous ammonia handling processes are subject to the CalARP Program Level 2 Requirements.  SJCWRP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the US EPA RMP and to the CalARP Program Level 3 requirements.  These programs require a summary in the RMP of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \r\n  \u00bf Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n  \u00bf General facility and regulated substances information.\r\n  \u00bf Offsite c"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\n\r\nThe CSDLAC emergency response policy involves the preparation of Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Consolidated Contingency Plans (HMHWCCP) for handling hazardous materials which are specific for each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program requirements.  The CSDLAC has prepared a HMHWCCP for the SJCWRP for storing and handling hazardous materials, including aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The HMHWCCP has been coordinated with the local response agency, the County of Los Angeles Fire Department (LACFD).  The SJCWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia (19.5% concentration) is used to maintain the disinfection limits in the treated effluent.  The aqueous ammonia is provided by delivery truck and transferred via hose to the ammonia storage tanks.

The working capacity of each tank is 5,120 gallons, and each tank is provided with a high level alarm, pressure relief valves, and secondary containment.  The aqueous ammonia is then transferred from the storage tanks to dosing locations within the effluent channel and mixed.  Once the aqueous ammonia is mixed with the treated effluent, CalARP regulations no longer apply.\r\n\r\nChlorine used for chlorination at SJCWRP and is received in chlorine trailers and transferred to bulk storage tanks located inside the buildings.  Sulfur dioxide used for dechlorination is also received at SJCWRP in sulfur dioxide trailers and transferred to storage tanks located inside the buildings.  The chlorination systems at SJCWRP consist of two chlorine bulk storage tanks, evaporators, chlorinators, residual analyzers, ejectors, diffusers, chlorine contact tanks, piping and other equipment.  The capacity of each chlorine bulk storage tank is 25 tons; however, the maximum quantity of chlorine present in a tank at any given time is only 18 tons.  In case of a major chlorine leak, the bulk storage tanks and the chlorine tank trailer can be isolated by the emergency shutoff valves located on the piping downstream of the bulk storage tank manway and at the end of the flexible hoses that connect to the tank trailer.  There are emergency shutdown switches (push buttons) located outside each door into the chlorine building, and on the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel located on the mezzanine of the chlorine transfer area.  On the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel, there are individual control switches for each valve.  All emergency shutdown valves can also be activated from the Plant Control Room. \r\n\r\nChlorine gas detectors are used to detect a chlorine leak in the bulk storage and chlorinator rooms.

Both facilities have the same scenarios for each chemical.\r\n&#8195;\r\nTABLE 2: SJCWRP EAST AND WEST ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n  RELEASE SCENARIO\t        CHEMICAL\tTYPE OF RELEASE\r\n  Alternative Release (OCA 2)\tAqueous Ammonia\tAmmonia truck transfer.\r\n  Alternative Release (OCA 4)\tChlorine\tFlexible hose release\r\n  Alternative Release (OCA 6)\tSulfur Dioxide\tFlexible hose release\r\n\r\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia for the water reclamation process has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community, SJCWRP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\r\n\r\nSJCWRP is in compliance with Federal and State PSM requirements.  SJCWRP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements: \r\n  \u00bf Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\r\n  \u00bf Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\r\n  \u00bf Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\r\n  \u00bf Performance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\r\n  \u00bf Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\r\n  \u00bf Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\r\n  \u00bf High level of training of the operators and maintenance staff.\r\n  \u00bf Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the awareness of the hazardous and toxic propertie"

      "SummaryText": "accidental release, external resources such as the LACFD will be called upon to aid in handling an aqueous ammonia, chlorine, or sulfur dioxide release.  As part of the emergency response program, CSDLAC has developed and implemented HMHWCCPs for both facilities for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The HMHWCCPs have been coordinated with the local response agency (LACFD).  The main elements of each emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an emergency, including procedures for immediate action and internal notifications, (3) procedures for external notifications, including coordination with Local Governments, Incident Commanders, (4) incident action plan, including mitigation actions, response resources, (5) implementation of tactical plan, and (6) termination and follow-up actions. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nIn 1990, as part of its compliance with the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), numerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the storage, handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the PHAs conducted at the SJCWRP.  The PHAs conducted in 1990 were reviewed in 1997 under the RMPP and PSM Program as part of an update.  In 1999, as part of its compliance with the US EPA RMP and California RMP programs CSDLAC conducted PHA updates for the storage, handling and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at SJCWRP.  Furthermore, in 2004 and 2009, CSDLAC conducted a PHA on the storage, handling and use of aqueous ammonia at SJCWRP.  ALL recommended actions resulting from these PHAs and PHA Updates have been implemented as required.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the 2014 Five-Year RMP Update and Revalidation, PHA updates were conducted for the storage, handling and use of chlorine, sulfur dioxide and aqueous ammonia.  Based on this review, additional recommended actions have been identified to further improve the safety of chlor"

Chemical-specific prevention steps include the use of supplied air respirators (SAR) and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine/sulfur dioxide supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine/sulfur dioxide, presence of chlorine/sulfur dioxide detectors and alarms, remotely-controlled shutoff valves, and chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubbers. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by SJCWRP to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  \r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program (Program Level 2 and Level 3) elements include:\r\n  \u00bf Safety Information/Process Safety Information,\r\n  \u00bf Hazard Review/Process Hazard Analysis,\r\n  \u00bf Operating Procedures,\r\n  \u00bf Training,\r\n  \u00bf Mechanical Integrity,\r\n  \u00bf Management of Change,\r\n  \u00bf Pre-Startup Safety Review,\r\n  \u00bf Compliance Audits,\r\n  \u00bf Incident Investigation,\r\n  \u00bf Employee Participation,\r\n  \u00bf Hot Work Permit, and \r\n  \u00bf Contractors.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe accident history can be found in the documentation located behind the Incident Investigation Tab in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook.  No reportable accidents have occurred at the SJCWRP facilities in the last five years, since 2009.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nSJCWRP-trained operators are first responders to aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide leak alarms and accidental releases.  Operators from SJCWRP East respond to accidental releases at SJCWRP West when operators are not present after hours.  Depending on the severity of the"

The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of these systems.\r\n\r\nCSDLAC has initiated preliminary design for the conversion of the existing chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemical facilities at SJCWRP East and SJCWRP West to sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite chemical facilities.  The emergency caustic scrubbers at each facility shall also be decommissioned as part of each project.  This project is expected to be completed by the next submission date in 2019.\r\n\r\nFLAMMABLES: WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE\r\n\r\nThe use of flammable materials at SJCWRP is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.7(q), the general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of ammonia were addressed by the 2014 PHA and a previous Seismic Assessment.  Copies of the 2014 PHA conducted by Risk Management Professionals, and 2014 Seismic Assessment conducted by CSDLAC are available in the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook."
