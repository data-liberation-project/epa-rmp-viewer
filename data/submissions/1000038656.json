This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream Partners' release mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes, just to name a few.  Enable Midstream Partners' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if an unintentional release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to respond by activating the plant's Emergency Shutdown (ESD) System in an effort to safely avert further unintentional product release, evacuate the release area and to notify local emergency response authorities.\r\n\t\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ROGER MILLS GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant, located approximately 10 miles northwest of Elk City in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, operates a propane refrigeration system to assist in extracting liquid petroleum products from rich raw natural gas.  Plant products include pipeline quality natural gas-primarily methane-and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The refrigeration system includes a High Pressure Receiver vessel containing propane, a regulated flammable material.\r\n\t\r\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, there are no regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity present at the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant."

The inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.21 miles. There is a pipeline station which is occasionally manned within the 0.21 mile radius. Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating or calculating the WCS for the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant.  \r\n\t\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant is a Vapor Cloud Fire resulting from a sight glass blowout at the bottom of the vessel, releasing the entire 17,398 pounds of propane in the HP Receiver. A conservative 50% of this propane was assumed to be in the pressurized liquid phase, producing an initial release rate of 1354 pounds. The distance to the Lower Flammability Limit of 36 mg/L was calculated to be less than 0.10 miles for the dense propane gas. There are no public receptors within the reported 0.10 mile distance. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\r\n\t\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Roger Mills Gas Plant.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) or revalidation team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives developed that address process safety and employee safety issues.  This includes forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\t\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\t\r\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant keeps a variety of technical documents utilized to maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\t\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\t\r\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\t\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\t\r\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant has well-established"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\t\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \r\n\t\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\t\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\t\r\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\t\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\t\r\nEnable Midstream promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
