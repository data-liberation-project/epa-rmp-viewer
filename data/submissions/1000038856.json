The site's EHS Compliance Manager has been assigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and for ammonia refrigeration safety.  \n\n\n\nThe Schwan's Global Supply Chain facility in Florence, KY occupies approximately 35 acres in an open, relatively flat, industrial area.  Within 500 feet of the west side of the facility is the I-75/I-71 combined interstate, and 500 feet on the other side of the interstate is residential area.\n\n\n\nThe Florence facility manufactures frozen pizza.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at this facility.  Ammonia is the most efficient and environmentally compatible refrigerant available.  Although it is toxic at high concentrations and is an irritating gas; it is not a cumulative metabolic poison, does not cause cancer or other dreadful diseases, and does not cause lasting environmental damage.\n\n\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the EPA's RMPComp program using a worst case of a tank rupture of the high pressure receiver on the old system. The maximum quantity that this vessel can hold is 37,834 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The Schwan's Global Supply Chain plant in Florence is located in an area that meets the definition of \"urban\".  \n\n\n\nThe alternate case scenario's release rate is based on the EPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration.  We are using a release rate of 100 lbs/min based on the EPA guidance document.  Our alternate case scenario will be the release of ammonia at high-pressure receiver conditions through a ?\" orifice from a gasket rupture. \n\n\n\nSchwan's maintains 24/7 coverage of emergency responders trained to the 24-hour HAZMAT first responders operation level at the facility with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.  The team numbers approximately 30 members.  The training is"

      "SummaryText": " conducted by the Cincinnati State Workforce Development Center. The training is designed with a heavy emphasis on ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, personal protective equipment up to use of Level 'A' Suits and interaction with an incident command system / national incident management system (ICS/NIMS).  Copies of emergency plans are filed with the Florence Fire Department, and annual facility walkthroughs are conducted with Florence Fire Officers.  A post-incident debriefing and investigation is conducted after each incident.  The Plant is fenced, security contractor is on-site 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  The facility refrigeration team is on-duty 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.\n\n\n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in the Schwan's company culture, improvements in system safety are implemented as a result of employee-based Total Quality Management (TQM) teams, a designated PSM team, accepted industry practices, e.g., IIAR, EPA, and OSHA, and as a result of system engineering modifications and extensions.  Post incident debriefings and incident investigations are used to identify additional improvements to system safety.\n\n"
