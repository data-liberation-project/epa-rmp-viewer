              "Description": "The Occidental Chemical Pasadena plant operates one covered process: the Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Process.  This process consists of interconnected equipment spanning from the VCM Spheres to the VCM Charge System to the PVC Reactor System to the VCM Recovery System.  All this equipment is considered to be operated within a single unit.  For the purpose of providing focus and to breakdown tasks involved, the process is broken down into various segments on which separate PHA studies are conducted.  The various elements of the Prevention Program mentioned here are common to all segments of this process and are applied equally.  Several common type of safeguards such as lower explosive limit (LEL) detectors, deluge systems and alarms/interlocks are provided throughout this process.  The exception as noted above is the timing of completion of latest PHA studies, which are provided below by the systems studied: VCM Spheres completed in 03/2006, VCM Charge System completed in 08/2005, PVC Reactors completed in 10/2006, PVC Degassers completed in 05/2007, Reactor Short Stop Systems completed in 10/2004, Slurry Tanks and Pumpout completed in 10/2008, Slurry Strippers completed in 01/2009, VCM Recovery completed in 11/2005, and RECO VCM Recovery completed in 09/2006.",

One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Pasadena PVC facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Pasadena PVC facility.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (A? 68.155(b))\n\nThe Occidental Chemical Corporation A? Pasadena PVC Plant facility handles one chemical regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (A? 68.155(d))\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facilityA?s prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Program regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Key Procedures, Contractors.\n\nEach of the elements listed above are documented, and routinely reviewed for improvement.\n\nFive-year Accident History (A? 68.155(e))\n\nThere were not any RMP accidents at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (A? 68.155(f))\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facility has established a written emergency "

All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (A?ECCA?).  In addition, the Pasadena PVC facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (A?SSPA?) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nThe facility is a member of the Pasadena Local Emergency Planning Committee (A?LEPCA?), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (A? 68.155(g))\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.  Specific changes include installation of additional process controls and enhancements related to the Pasadena Modernization Project."
