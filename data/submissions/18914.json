Hood, Inc. is committed to operating its milk processing plant in Oneida, New York in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment, Hood has developed and implemented numerous safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases of ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  Hood has also developed and implemented a number of programs that are designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to people, the environment and the plant.  Many of these programs have been in place for some time. \n\nHood views accident prevention, and personnel and environmental protection as a never-ending process.  Consequently, Hood continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  A recent addition to Hood's overall accident prevention and response program is the development of  its Risk Management Program.  Hood's Risk Management Program (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One of the requirements of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan.  This document is Hood's RMP plan and provides the public with information about Hood's processes, accident prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts.  Hood's compliance with EPA's RMP rule includes:\n\n1. Completion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, including the five-year accidental release history--Hood has never experienced an RMP reportable release or accident at its Oneida plant.   \n2. Implementation of a accident prevention program."

Hood has compiled written process safety information which helped identify the hazards posed by ammonia, handling of materials, management, storage activities and the refrigeration process in general.  The compilation of process safety information provided the foundation for understanding the hazards involved in the refrigeration process and was crucial to the development of a complete and thorough process hazard analyses (discussed in subsection 3 immediately below).

      "SummaryText": "40F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely low.\n\nUsing the EPA mandated criteria described above, the worst-case release at the plant (for purposes of RMP) would involve a complete failure of the largest  storage tank, filled to maximum capacity with 23,000 lbs. of ammonia.  If such a release occurred, it would result in a vapor cloud that could impact persons outside of the plant's property line.\n\nHood developed an alternative release of ammonia that focuses on a more realistic release scenario occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  EPA requires modeling of a release which could impact off-site locations.  Alternative release modeling of the most realistic scenario resulted in off-site impacts.  This release did not, however, impact residences, recreation areas, schools, hospitals, prisons or any environmental receptors.  Accordingly, after considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the Process Hazard Analysis performed on the refrigeration process, and all past releases, Hood used a gas line rupture for its alternative release.  The rupture would result in a release of 9.8 pounds in five minutes.   More realistic meteorological conditions were used to generate a more realistic toxic endpoint distance.\n\n\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nHood has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management rule found at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 and analagous to RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  The program has been very successful as evidenced by the fact that the plant has never experienced an accidental release that requires reporting under EPA's RMP rule.  See 40 C.F.R. ' 68.42.  To comply with the RMP rule, the plant has taken its existing PSM program and incorporated an additional focus-protection of the public."

Hood plant in Oneida, NY is owned and operated by Catamount Dairy Holdings.  The plant processes milk.  Ammonia is the only chemical present at the plant in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the chemical accident prevention rule.  Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system used to process and store milk and other dairy products.\n\nAmmonia is stored in two tanks outside of the H.P. Hood facility.  The larger of the tanks has a capacity of 4,415 gallons.  The total maximum amount of ammonia used at any one time in the refrigeration process is 23,000 lbs.\n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, Hood's off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for all toxic chemicals (ammonia) and an alternative release for each covered chemical (ammonia).\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.  EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind which would not disperse a release very effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest vessel is released in ten minutes.  The probability of a 23,000 lb. tank of ammonia releasing its entire contents in ten minutes in New York on a 9"

Implementation of an emergency response program.  As recommended in the RMP rule and by numerous federal response entities, the plant has developed a single Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that is designed to meet the emergency response planning requirements applicable to the plant under a number of federal and state emergency response and accident prevention planning laws. \n\nAdditional information regarding how Hood addresses each of these requirements is provided below and in the attached RMP plan.\n\nWhile the RMP program at Hood helps ensure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it is just one component of Hood's comprehensive safety programs.  Additional components that are beyond the scope of the RMP include, but are not limited to: regular employee/contractor safety training, periodic table-top safety and emergency response drills, acquisition and maintenance of emergency response and personnel protective equipment, development of safe work practices (confined space, lockout/tagout, hot work), implementation of safe work procedures, new project safety review procedures, preventive maintenance and regular inspections of all tanks and equipment that contain hazardous chemicals, chemical control and purchasing procedures, medical emergency response training, contractor certification, etc. \n\nThe plant and all equipment is designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  At a minimum, the plant and equipment meet government and industry design and construction standards.\n\n\nThe following most recent safety initiative demonstrate Hood's commitment to providing a safe workplace:\n \n1.

Emergency Planning and Response.  Hood has developed an integrated contingency plan that satisfies all applicable state and federal emergency response and accident prevention planning requirements (described under emergency response policies below). \n\n13.\tCompliance Audits.  Hood evaluates the plant's compliance with the PSM Standard and the RMP rule at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices it has developed are adequate and being followed.  RMP and PSM audit findings reports are developed. \n\n14.\tTrade Secrets.  Hood makes all necessary information available to those persons responsible for compiling process safety information and those assisting in the development of the process hazard analysis. \n\nE. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Oneida plant has never experienced a RMP reportable release.\n\n\nF. Emergency Response Procedures and Policies\n\nCertain Hood employees at the Oneida plant have been trained to respond to small ammonia releases and other incidental spills and leaks.  Employees have also been trained on confined space entry procedures and the proper use of personal protection equipment (PPE).  In the event of small fires, plant employees have been trained in the use of fire extinguishers.  Personnel have also been trained to notify the plant manager in the event of more extensive accidental releases.  The plant manager is responsible for assessing the extent of releases, internal notification of releases and determinations of whether or not outside responders are needed.  During an emergency, Hood employees have been trained to evacuate to a predesignated muster point.\n\nIn the event that an accidental release occurs that is beyond the capabilities of the plant employees to control, the plant dep"
