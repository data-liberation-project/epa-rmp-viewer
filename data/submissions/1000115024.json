      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (Metropolitan) treats and distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California. Metropolitan provides approximately 40 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by Metropolitan in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the previous century.  While many of Metropolitan\u0092s facilities have switched to ozone as a primary disinfectant, Metropolitan will still continue to utilize bulk chlorine for residual disinfection and as a backup disinfectant to ozone at all of its water treatment plants.  Metropolitan currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Henry J. Mills Water Treatment Plant (Mills Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  Metropolitan regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine. To further safe practices, Metropolitan has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Mills Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\n\nMills Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release"

Mills Plant has had an excellent safety record of chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Chlorine System at the Mills Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to convert the chlorine to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation, and vent exhaust gas arrestors (VEGA units)), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment systems for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels (cargo tanks) are totally contained in the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility storage bays.\n\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.  Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\n\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (un"

Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room, pipe tunnels and ejector cabinets.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing the storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator\u0092s console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by actuating the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.

Each employee presently involved in operating the chlorine process has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine leak response, as provided in the operating procedures.\n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or less to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, the Mills Plant management ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their Management of Change procedures and/or Pre Startup Safety Review procedures.  \n\nMills Plant management prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, provides certification of the records, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person(s) administering the training.\n\nContractors\n\nMetropolitan has procedures and policies in place that ensure that the contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work.  The contractors are informed, prior to the initiation of the work at the site, of the applicable provisions of the Emergency Action Plan.  Mills Plant operators, managers and EHS representatives hold contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area. Mills Plant management controls access to the process areas and helps evaluate the contractor's safety performance with EHS representatives.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nMills Plant management ensures that a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is completed"

Metropolitan management assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The last internal compliance audit was completed in June 2023. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMills Plant management investigates all incidents that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  If required, an investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that have caused or could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Mills Plant during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe Mills Plant is a non-responding facility and, as such, does not have an emergency response p"

      "SummaryText": "lan.  The Mills Plant has Technician Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond only to incidental chlorine releases and will respond to emergency releases only to assess the situation and take defensive measures.  The Mills Plant also includes employees trained in the Incident Command System, who can coordinate with and provide technical assistance to outside emergency responders.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Riverside City Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Mills Plant management coordinates routinely with local response agencies (Riverside City Fire Department, CalFIRE and Riverside County Department of Environmental Health) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Mills Plant chlorine system and its emergency response requirements and that this is reflected in their Area Plans.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified during Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) for the original chlorine process in 1992, 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2004 and again for the new Chlorine Containment & Handling Facility in 2006, 2011 and 2016 under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and Risk Management Program  for the facility.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required."
