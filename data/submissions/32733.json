The Director of Warehouse Maintenance administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Director of Warehouse Maintenance periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nErie - Lancaster is located at 5873 Genesee Street in Lancaster, New York, which is approximately \u00bc miles south of the I-90.  The facility and the refrigeration system began operation in 1996.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural.\n\nThe primary business of Erie - Lancaster is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for glycol chilling, dock operations, cold storage, and freezers.  Typical operating conditions range from 33.5 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 165 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia ref"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Erie - Lancaster to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Erie - Lancaster's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alarm in"

There are also approximately 30 additional ammonia sensors located throughout the facility in close proximity to the refrigeration equipment.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the Erie - Lancaster Director of Warehouse Maintenance.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Erie Lancaster Hazard Assessment Update Report (02/02/2004), there has been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (February 1999 - February 2004.)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\u00bf save lives;\n\u00bf minimize and avoid injuries;\n\u00bf protect the environment; and\n\u00bf minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility as well as detailing the training, procedures, and members of the Emergency Response Team.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn October 1996, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, a Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in September 2003.  The PHA Revalidation consisted of a:\n\n\u00bf Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n\u00bf series of safety checklists; and\n\u00bf facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.
