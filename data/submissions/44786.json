SPS takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  As for emergency response, SPS has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nSPS management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the RMP manual.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nCunningham Station is a natural gas-burning electric generating station.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The chlorine is used for cooling and drinking water biocidal control and is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 2 containers on site, and is stored in 150 lb. cylinders with a maximum inventory of 2 containers on site, respectively.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine System\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Cunningham Station Chlorine System PSM/RMP manual.  The prevention programs include the following elements:\n? Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in the development and implementation of the plant PSM/RMP programs, as well as ready access to program i"

Process hazard analysis (PHA) - A PHA for the chlorine system was conducted in February 1999.  A PHA revalidation was conducted in February 2004.  All recommendations from the PHAs have been addressed.\n? Operating procedures for the chlorine process, which are included in the system PSM/RMP manuals\n? Training for all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system\n? Contractor management policy, which is not to allow contractors to operate or maintain the chlorine system\n? Pre-startup safety review procedure for implementation for significant system changes to ensure that the construction and equipment installation is according to design specifications, appropriate procedures are in place and accurate, a PHA has been done and the recommendations resolved, and employees are trained prior to startup of the modified system\n? Mechanical integrity program through the facility CMMS system to ensure that the chlorine system equipment is maintained in good and safe working condition.  The plant undertakes daily/shift inspections of chlorine system equipment, as well as more significant inspections and tests on system components at frequencies determined by compliance with recommendations of the Chlorine Institute and system component manufacturers.  The most recent date of a major test is included in this submittal.\n? Hot work procedures to require the evacuation of the regulated chemicals from the system equipment (using the Cunningham Station Clearance Procedures before work is performed on the chlorine system\n?

Compliance audits to be conducted at least once every three years to ensure the continued compliance of the Cunningham Station chlorine PSM/RMP program.  The last audit was conducted in December 2002;  all findings have been promptly resolved.\n? Trade secrets provisions allowing contractors and employees or their representatives access to system information\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42. However, the facility did have a release of approximately 100 lbs on August 23, 2001.There were no injuries associated with this reportable release. An incident investigation was conducted and corrective actions were implemented.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies and includes emergency response by an on-site response team backed up by the Hobbs Fire Department.  The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Cunningham Station PSM/RMP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention "
