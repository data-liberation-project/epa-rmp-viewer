The facility has not had any ammonia releases.  The facility has conducted and documented PHA and self audits and responded to the finding by making appropriate compliance enhancements as they are identified.  In addition Kraft Foods Global, Inc. has implemented, and Kraft Columbus has incorporated, itA?s own Ammonia Refrigeration Management System (ARMS) and a program to utilize the IRC auditing process to further assure the compliance of the facility.  This facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours A? 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Hamilton Township Fire Department in the event of an emergency.  Each year a team of facility associates and the Hamilton Township Fire department participates in a hands on combined HAZWHOPER and Emergency Response Plan training activity at the Kraft facility.\n\n\nThe latest PSM Compliance Audit was conducted on the ammonia refrigeration system at the Groveport, Ohio Distribution Warehouse on Febuary 12, 2007. This audit addresses the Process Safety Management (PSM) 3 year Compliance Audit requirements in 29 CFR 1910.119, OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation Section 1910.119(o).\n\nThe 2007 PSM Audit Executive Summary states that the Columbus Ammonia Ref"

The audit identified key opportunities for improvement in training and communication of procedures and policies to the facility staff and warehouse employees, which were addressed.  \n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Columbus facility is a warehouse/distribution center for the Schenker Logistics food products.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 49312.  Several areas of the plant are refrigerated to store the finished products.\n\nSchenker Logistics has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68:  We have ammonia at this location.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the meats in the various areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 18,104 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Schenker Logistics in Columbus.\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Schenker Logistics ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.\n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1. In order to protect the piping and evaporators from being impacted by heavy machinery or plant personnel the piping has been installed on the roof of the building. Our forklifts do not have the ability to reach the evaporators at the ceiling of the warehouse.\n\n2. The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n3. The ammonia system contains state of the art controls and equipm"

The ammonia detection system also monitors the exhaust fans.\n\n5. The plant is monitored by monitoring company 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, to insure access to the plant is limited to Schenker and authorized personnel.\n\n6. The ammonia detection alarms are monitored by a contracted alarm company.\n\n7. The ammonia system is visually inspected on a daily basis.\n\n8. The ammonia system controls can be monitored at home or any location by the primary system operator through a personal computer.\n\n9. All the relief valves located inside the Machine Room are piped to a common header that releases to the atmosphere.\n\n10. The ammonia detection system is inspected on an annually basis by a certified contractor and the fire system equipment on a quarterly basis.\n\n4.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facilityA?s accident history includes the following range of dates:  September 1, 1998 to current.  According to 40 CFR Pat 68.42(a), to date, there have been no accidents.\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Columbus plant has developed an emergency response program comprised of three\nelements: emergency communications, emergency evacuation procedures and an off-site plan.  Separate documents, or plans, were produced to define the policies and procedures at the Columbus Plant.  The plans were also written to identify to the plant employees what precautions and steps should be taken in the event of the release of a hazardous substance.  The combination of the three documents yields a comprehensive Emergency Response Program document.  The following paragraphs discuss briefly the contents of each of the three specified documents.\n\nThe emergency communications document is written to establish procedures to notify appropriate agencies (like the Hamilton Township Fire Department) and company trained emergency response team mem"
