The chlorine building is kept closed at all times to contain any accidental releases.  There is a scrubber to actively mitigate any accidental release of chlorine contaminant up to 2000 pounds.  The scrubber is checked to see if it is operating during every workshift at the facility.  There are several chlorine detectors placed throughout the inside of the chlorine building to provide warning of any chlorine release.  At a concentration of 0.5 ppm, there is an audible alarm and a yellow warning light from the detector alarm panel inside the chlorine building.  At this concentration, the scrubber is set to automatically engage.  At 1.0 ppm, the detector alarm panel will emit an intermittent flashing red light.  The exterior alarm will sound and a rotating red strobe light will activate.\n\nThe facility has complied with Program 3 Prevention Program (subpart D of 40 cfr Part 68) of the EPA standard.  That is, the facility has:\n1.    Compiled process safety information.\n2.    Performed a process hazard analysis and has continuously updated the PHA when necessary.\n3.    Developed and implemented safe operating procedures.\n4.    Provided training through computer-based interactive training modules.\n5.    Established a mechanical integrity program.\n6.    Implemented management of change procedures.\n7.    Performed pre-startup safety reviews when necessary.\n8.    Performed compliance audits.\n9.    Established incident investigation procedures.\n10.    Established an employee participation plan.\n11.    Established hot work permit procedures.\n12.    Established a screening process for hiring contractors to"

Established contractor roles and performance criteria.\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no accidental releases from the chlorination process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  Response to chlorine releases of 10 ppm or above is handled by Palm Beach County Hazmat/fire rescue.  The facility has established procedures for contacting them in such instances.  The facility will attempt to mitigate minor chemical releases (i.e., under 10 ppm within the chlorine building) and has established procedures to do so.\n\nTo improve safety, the facility is in the process of updating and revising the computer-based interactive training modules.\n"
