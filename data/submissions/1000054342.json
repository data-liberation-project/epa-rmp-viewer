EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n[40 CFR 68.155; CalARP Article 3, 2745.3]\n\nThe Risk Management Program at Uni-Kool Partners is designed to prevent the occurrence and\n\nminimize the consequences of releases of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration process.\n\nThe following is a summary of the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk\n\nof a hazardous materials release.\n\nThe purpose of the RMP is threefold: 1.) to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals,\n\nespecially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards, 2.) to\n\nidentify hazards associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia, and 3.) to provide procedures\n\nto minimize the risks involved with handling this material.\n\nUni-Kool Partners has implemented the RMP at the Salinas, CA facility in order to comply with\n\nregulations, and to fulfill this facility's responsibility to protect its employees, equipment,\n\nproperty, the surrounding community, and the environment from accidental releases of\n\nanhydrous ammonia.\n\n1. Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nUni-Kool Partners will maintain a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize any\n\nreleases. The program will include regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging\n\nconditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze\n\nreleases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Incident Investigation Forms. A Risk\n\nManagement Program, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia\n\nrefrigeration system, is maintained on-site along with this RMP.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.\n\nOperators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration\n\nsystem. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia\n\nrelease. There are emergency shut off switches for shutting down the system. Personnel will\n\nautomatically be notified if any detector e"

All\n\nrelief valves for the fixed equipment at W. Market are tied to the ammonia diffusion tank to\n\nprevent high pressure releases to ambient.\n\nOnsite personnel provide initial emergency response. Onsite personnel will make a preliminary\n\nassessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include\n\nemergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down\n\nto prevent or reduce an offsite release with full face cartridge mask. First response does not\n\ninclude wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus and entry into the area where leak occurs.\n\nUni-Kool personnel are not certified to perform this type of safety response.\n\nNo emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the\n\ncapabilities of the operators or other onsite personnel.\n\nRisk Management Plan with Process Safety Management November, 2015\n\nUni-Kool Partners II-2\n\nSalinas, CA\n\nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for\n\na major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency\n\nresponse.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for\n\nnew employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five\n\n(5) years.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nUni-Kool Partners, located at West Market St. Facilities, Salinas, CA, utilizes anhydrous\n\nammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. The facility was constructed under applicable\n\ncodes and industry standards at the time of construction.\n\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their vacuum cooling, produce\n\ncooling, and ice making operations as well as cold storage prior to shipment. Fresh product is\n\nbrought from the fields and cooled "

The refrigeration systems for each facility are independent of one another. The\n\nlargest single system charge is 13,905 lbs. at 730 West Market St. facility.\n\nThe Uni-Kool Partners West Market St. Facilities have both fixed and portable refrigeration\n\nsystems onsite composed of compressors with common thermosiphon receivers, evaporative\n\ncondensers, vacuum tubes, evaporative cooling coils, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, water\n\nchillers, ice generators and a diffusion tank. All compressors have safety switches that would\n\nshut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Pressure vessels,\n\nwith the exception of some oil separators, and the compressors are protected by safety relief\n\nvalves against high pressure situations. There are ammonia detectors in most of the cold rooms\n\nand in the mechanical room/areas for alarming. There is a list of responders experienced with\n\nammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.\n\nSafeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance\n\npersonnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and\n\ninspection\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are single stage vapor compression cycles.
