      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nCalpine Hermiston Power LLC in Hermiston, Oregon handles anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by EPA.  The toxicity of ammonia at high concentrations make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.   Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nCalpines emergency response program is designed to effectively respond to an accidental release of ammonia.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, and the National Response Center.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary purpose of the generating station is to produce electric power from combustion of natural gas.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen (N0x) produced during combustion.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored as a liquid under pressure in two storage tanks.  The ammonia is transported by pipeline, from storage and injected into the combustion system where it reacts with the natural gas combustion products to minimize N0x formation.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia that can be stored at this station is 146,800 pounds (73,400 pounds in each of two storage tanks).\n\n \n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Preventi"

      "SummaryText": "on Steps\n\nCalpine Hermiston Power LLC complies with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable ammonia storage and handling codes.  All employees involved with the operation or maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system are thoroughly trained using Calpine's documented training program.\n\n\n\nThe chemical specific prevention steps include the following administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public and the environment.  \n\nAmmonia Storage Tank:  pressure indicators, level indicators, safety valves, temperature gauges, ammonia leak detectors. \n\nSecondary Containment:  The secondary containment area is sufficient to contain the full contents of the vessel, 24 hours of rainfall as determined by the 25-year storm and deluge water for 20 minutes as determined by code. \n\nAmmonia leak detectors alarm only in the control room.  An alarm sounds when a concentration of 5 ppm of ammonia is detected.  Another alarm sounds when a concentration of 25 ppm is detected.  Action must be taken to control a leak.  In an emergency situation, the deluge system should be manually activated from the mash button in the Control Room.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia causing on-site or off-site injury or damage have occurred during the life of this facility.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nCalpine's emergency response program is based upon an accidental release of ammonia.  We have discussed this program with the Hermiston Fire Department. \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes\n\nHermiston has reviewed its last Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in March 2010.  As a result of the review, no changes have been made to the system or the procedure.\n\n"
