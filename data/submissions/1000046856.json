The threshold quantity for silane is 10,000 pounds.  The two isomodule trailers combined contain silane gas in the amount of approximately 26,400 pounds when full.\n\n\n\n2.1    Silane Storage and Delivery System Engineering Controls\n\n\n\nSilane for the Storage and Delivery System is primarily sourced from an isomodule received from TGCM.  The isomodule will be located outdoors in the silane yard area on GLOBALFOUNDRIES' property.  Silane is a compressed gas filled to a maximum pressure of 1,500 psig at 70?F.  The isomodule has eight tubes (22 inch diameter by 36 feet long) that contain a maximum of 1,650 pounds when full, totaling 13,200 lb per isomodule.  For added safety, a protective expanded-metal enclosure is provided around the tube valves and manifold piping.  The isomodule pneumatic cylinder valves and manual valves are manifolded together in the rear enclosure.  Cylinder pneumatic valves are provided on the isomodule to provide automatic tube switching and emergency shutoff capability at the source. A pneumatic valve is provided on the isomodule manifold to provide emergency shutoff capability at the source as well as local purge port capability.  Restrictive flow orifices (RFOs) are installed at the withdrawal connections on each container to prevent a worst-case downstream leak scenario.  Optical flame detectors (UV/IR monitors) are aimed at both source containers' withdrawal connections to cause a system shutdown on a flame detection alarm.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has two isomodule trailers for a maximum inventory at the site of 26,400 pounds of silane gas.  \n\n\n\n2.2    Hazard Assessment\n\n\n\n2.2.1    Introduction.

The Hazard Assessment consists of the following tasks:\n\n\n\n?    worst-case release scenario analysis\n\n?    alternative release scenario analysis\n\n?    defining off-site impacts - population and environmental receptors\n\n?    five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThe GLOBALFOUNDRIES facility currently uses silane, which is on the list of regulated flammable substances (40 CFR Part 68.130). The flammable endpoint for silane is 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure.  \n\n\n\n2.2.2        Worst-Case Release Scenario Description.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the \"release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint\" [40 CFR Part 68.25].  The \"endpoint\" or \"flammable endpoint\" of a substance is defined as the distance a toxic vapor cloud, fire, or explosion from an accidental release will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur. The Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance provided by the USEPA recommends that the worst-case release scenario be based on the following:\n\n\n\n1.    Failure of the single biggest vessel holding silane, leading to an airborne release of the entire inventory.\n\n\n\n2.    The release rate is the total inventory uniformly distributed over 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n3.    The meteorological conditions at the time of the release are characterized by a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s), an ambient temperature of   77?F (25?C), and an atmospheric stability class F.\n\n\n\n4.    Passive mitigation systems may be included in the analysis (if applicable).\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is defined as a release of silane from an entire tube (22 inch diameter by 36 feet long) from the eight tube module.  Specifically, this scenario results in a release of the entire contents 1654 lbs (750 kg) of a single module vessel during a catastrophic failure. The contents of the vessel form a vapor cloud followed by a delayed ignition resulting in a vapor cloud "

The hazard assessment guideline of RMP requires the worst case release results include a vapor cloud containing the total quantity of the substance that could be released from a vessel.  \n\n\n\nNo passive mitigation measures (e.g., berms, and dikes) were considered as part of this worst-case release scenario. \n\n\n\n2.2.3        Alternative Release Scenario Description.  The alternative release scenario [40 CFR Part 68.28] is considered the most likely release to occur from a covered process that is expected to produce the greatest distance to a flammable endpoint.  The Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance provided by the USEPA recommends that the alternative release scenario be based on the following:\n\n\n\n1.    The scenario most likely to occur.\n\n\n\n2.    The meteorological conditions at the time of the release are characterized by a wind speed of 3 meters per second (m/s), an ambient temperature of 77?F (25?C), and an atmospheric stability class D.\n\n\n\n3.    Active as well as passive mitigation systems may be included in the analysis (if applicable).\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario most likely to cause off-site consequences is a release of the entire contents of a single module vessel during a catastrophic failure of the vessel primary delivery valve. The valve is a mechanically assembled component which fails and the top works of the valve is removed from the base of the valve.  In this scenario, a 0.157 inch diameter hole remains in the base of the valve and limits the release rate from the vessel.  \n\n\n\nAs with the worst-case release scenario, no passive mitigation measures (e.g., berms, and dikes) or active mitigation measures were considered as part of this alternative release scenario. \n\n \n\n2.2.4        Off-Site Consequence Analysis.
