Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Intermountain Food Services are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the West Jordan Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated extremely hazardous substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 13,860 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analyses for our facility, we have used the RMP Comp program provided by the EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\n\nToxic Worst Case Analysis:\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from the low-pressure receiver at Sysco Intermountain Food Services.  The scenario involves the release of 2,400 pounds of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a liquid and gaseous form, over a period of 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 240, and a distance to endpoint of .7 miles is obtained, which aff"

This scenario involves the release of 1,700 pounds of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a liquid and gaseous form, over a period of 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 170 and a distance to endpoint of 0 miles is obtained, which affects a residential population of 0 within this distance.\n\nThere are no Flammables Worst-Case or Alternative Case Analyses for this facility.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40CFR, Part 68 of the EPA Clean Air Act regulation.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM regulation, 29CFR1910.119.\nOur Ammonia (anhydrous) process is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility:\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficiently and safely.  The methodology used to conduct these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nSysco Intermountain Food Services maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation including initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnarou"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\n\nSysco Intermountain Food Services has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees and contractors who are operating the ammonia refrigeration system are qualified to follow the required procedures.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job training until they are evaluated as competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently if required.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nSysco Intermountain Food Services conducts well-documented maintenance and inspections for the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that it is operating properly.  Process equipment examined during the maintenance and inspections includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel conduct maintenance operations only after receiving specialized training.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance or inspections are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Intermountain Food Services to manage changes to the ammonia refrigeration system process, chemicals, technology, and equipment.  Process operators, maintenance and contractor personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification of process operations, are promptly informed of and given training to safely manage the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications to existing processes, are conducted as a regular practice at Sysco Intermountain Food Services.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that the design, installation, maintenance and operation of the ammonia refrigeration system is safe prior to any equipment operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nSysco Intermounta"

These audits are conducted at least every three years and any corrective actions noted during the audits are corrected as soon as possible.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nSysco Intermountain Food Services promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of Ammonia (anhydrous).  These investigations are conducted to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nSysco Intermountain Food Services believes that Process Safety, Risk Management and accident prevention require a team effort to be successful.  Company and contractor employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning the ammonia refrigeration system and to recommend any improvements to the system.  In addition, our employees and contractors have access to all information created as a part of the facility Process Safety and Risk Management plans.\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, Sysco Intermountain Food Services hires contractors to conduct specialized operating,  maintenance and construction activities for the ammonia refrigeration system.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed.  Sysco Intermountain Food Services has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the ammonia refrigeration system.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification, evacuation and employee accountability in the event of an Ammonia (anhydrous) release.\n\n5.  5-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents or incidents at this facility during the past 5 y"
