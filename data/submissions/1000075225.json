      "SummaryText": "Adient GEORGETOWN, KENTUCKY\n\n\n\n1.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nAdient owns and operates a foam seat manufacturing facility located in Georgetown, Kentucky.  On site, the Georgetown plant has two 6,000 gallon storage tanks and four 60 gallon day tanks which store Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), a regulated hazardous substance, for the manufacturing of polyurethane foam car seats.  The maximum intended inventory of TDI on site is above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds listed in 40 C.F.R. A? 68.130.\n\n\n\nSince the quantity of TDI exceeds the threshold quantity, the Georgetown plant is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP).  The Georgetown plant is subject to Program Level 1 requirements.  This submission of RMPSubmit presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Georgetown.  The required RMP information was electronically submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the deadline of February 13, 2019 for the 5 year update.\n\n\n\nRMP Submit defines minimum and maximum values that can be entered.  Specifically, limitations exist for the release rate (Section 2.6), release duration (Section 2.7), toxic endpoint distance (Section 2.11).  Due to these limitations, Georgetown was forced to use the default (inaccurate) values for the release rate, release duration, and toxic endpoint distance for this submittal rather than the more accurate values utilized by the ISCST3 model.  \n\n\n\nTable 1.

      "SummaryText": " protection if exposure limits may be exceeded, are taken when handling TDI itself or equipment that has been in contact with the chemical.  In order to prevent accidental release of the chemical from various sources, numerous safety procedures have been enacted to ensure the maximum safety of the employees working with TDI and the population surrounding the plant.  Employees of the plant have been trained in the proper handling of TDI and in the actions to be taken in case of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nThe Georgetown facility has a maximum intended on-site inventory of 125,000 lbs of TDI. The largest spill would be a release from one of the 6,000 gallon storage tanks.  The storage tanks are located in a diked area designed to contain the entire contents of the tank.  In addition, the tank farm is located in a completely enclosed building.  Due to the mitigation measures in place and the low volatization of TDI, the toxic endpoint concentration of 7.0 mg/m3 does not reach outside the building.  In addition, safety measures that have been taken include informing the plant population of the hazards of the chemical, and making sure that proper procedures in the maintenance of the TDI equipment, such as pumps, filters, and valves, have been followed and adhered to.\n\n\n\nGeorgetown's emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.  These policies also summarize the actions that need to be taken in response to a chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.2    Description of Georgetown and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Georgetown plant, a ISO 14001 certified facility, produces molded polyurethane foam for automotive seating applications.  Foam production is a result of a specific blend of chemicals, including TDI, which are poured into specially designed molds.  Once the foam is inspected for imperfections, it is moved to the cloth covering area by a conveyor system, where it is covered by cloth and attached to the metal frame of th"

The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored in the plant is 125,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n1.3    Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nSection A? 68.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  All releases are assumed to take place at ground level for the worst-case and alternate case scenarios. \n\n\n\nAt Georgetown, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of the largest tank of TDI.  Since both large storage tanks have the same maximum capacity (61,080 lb.), one of the tanks is assumed to instantaneously release the entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The TDI will then be captured in the containment area under the large storage tanks and volatilize into the atmosphere.  The rate of vaporization into the atmosphere was found to be 2.18x10-3 lb/min as described in Table 1 above.\n\n\n\nModeling of this release was performed using the EPA's dispersion modeling software ISCST3 and shows that the toxic endpoint will extend 10 meters from the center of the diked area and will not exit the building.  Due to this, there are no affected public receptors or no environmental impacts that will occur off-site due to this release.  Because the worst-case release of TDI does not have offsite impacts, Georgetown qualifies for Program 1 of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n1.4    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps Adient Georgetown has specific process controls in place to minimize the risks of spills.  All chemical storage tanks are located indoors, above ground with secondary containment.  Tanks critical to the process have level sensors to prev"

Fill duration is also monitored during the transfer of TDI to the process lines and if not satisfied within a set time period, auto filling ceases and an alarm is activated.  Chemical wet systems are equipped with high and low-pressure switches to shut down in the event of a line rupture.  Critical valves are monitored electronically as to open/closed positioning.\n\n\n\nGeorgetown has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day to day operations.  Specific environmental issues are also addressed with this computer driven program.\n\n\n\nGeorgetown has established an Air Monitoring Program that monitors the airborne concentration of TDI within the production facility with use of TDI monitors. \n\n\n\nProperty Conservation and Risk Management audits are conducted annually by Factory Mutual Risk Appraisers as well as Environmental audits that are performed by an external audit company. The Georgetown plant had its last environmental audit and ISO 14001 audit on April 16, 2018. NO audit findings or audit action requests were found during this audit.This is the 8th year in row that the plants has been audited and no audit findings were issued. \n\n\n\n1.5    Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, Georgetown has no accidental releases of TDI that qualified as a spill or an exposure such that anyone required medical attention.\n\n\n\n1.6    The Emergency Response Program Georgetown's emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations. These policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical release. In the event of a release, the plant's HazMat Team will respond using appropriate actions, as described in the Plant's Spill Response Work Instruction (GW-LOS-WI-15-24-E), and in association with Scott County LEPC, Georgetown Fire Department and the Emergency Spill Contractor that we have contracted with.\n\n\n\nG"

If necessary, the appropriate outside facilities, such as the hospital or nearby residences and businesses, will be notified.  Employees are and will be trained in the safe handling and management of hazardous materials, respiratory protection, transportation of dangerous goods, and in the emergency response procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nAll spills that take place at the Georgetown facility must be documented and reported to the appropriate personnel.  The reporting allows the number and type of spills that occur to be tracked.  This in turn allows measures to be implemented to prevent similar spills from occurring in the future.  Spills exceeding the reportable quantity must be reported to certain regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nIf a release of 10 gallons or more of TDI has occurred, Adient informs Covestro, the supplier of TDI, of the accidental release and inquires about assistance and advice.\n\n\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Georgetown plant is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of its operation, including safety.  As such, Georgetown strives to take a proactive approach to ensure employee safety, health and wellness and to protect the environment.\n\n\n\nThe Georgetown plant conducts routine inspections and audits to ensure safe work conditions and compliance to applicable regulations.  These inspections and audits may be conducted by internal personnel from various levels of the organization (line employee to plant manager), by Adient personnel from other locations, or by outside consultants.  Results of the inspections and audits are documented and communicated, and action plans are developed to correct noted deficiencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
