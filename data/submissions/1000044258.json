This is accomplished through both engineering and administrative controls. All applicable elements of the U. S. EPA's Prevention Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management standard are adhered to. The Oil City Plant's Emergency Plan is tailored to meet the needs of any foreseeable release and was developed using input from the local emergency response agencies (Cornplanter Twp. Vol. FD, Oil City FD, and Venango County Emergency Management Agency). The plan was submitted and approved by the Venango County, PA Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe Oil City Plant is a manufacturing facility that produces Butylated Hydroxy Toluene (BHT), a crystalline Phenolic antioxidant and m-cresol, a chemical intermediate. Isobutylene (2-methylpropene) is stored in bulk at the plant, and is used to add the butyl groups onto mixed cresols (methylphenol). The isobutylene storage tanks and associated transfer equipment have several engineered safety features such as:  internal and external excess flow valves; perimeter monitor, alarm, and shutdown interlock systems; pressure relief valves; a flare protected vent system; and administrative procedures to prevent or detect releases. The plant is manned 24 hours a day and the isobutylene system is monitored continuously. There are automated vapor dispersing, fire extinguishing, and associated alarm systems around the isobutylene storage, reactor, compressor, and off-loading areas. All storage and handling equipment as well as all safety and countermeasure equipment are on a rigid testing and inspection program as well as a general preventive maintenance program.\r\n\r\nGenera"

They have been trained how to assess the situation and communicate to emergency response personnel the most prudent course of action to take to safeguard the community. Oil City Plant management personnel will report to work on site with emergency responders as a resource for controlling releases of isobutylene, and for operating counter measure systems. Oil City Plant personnel will assist the Incident Commander on the scene as specialists in handling isobutylene. The emergency plan is reviewed and resubmitted to the Venango County LEPC when updated for its review and approval. Necessary elements of the plan are incorporated into the Venango County Emergency Response Plan.  Periodic tabletop or deployment drills are conducted to keep emergency response personnel familiar with plant materials, emergency systems, and response measures.\r\n\r\nRecent Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Oil City Plant performs periodic process hazard analyses (safety reviews) of all chemical processes, including the isobutylene system. Some of the recently completed changes to improve the safety of the isobutylene storage and transfer system are listed below.\r\n\r\n1)Isobutylene thermal expansion relief valves located at the storage vessels and the unloading area were piped to the flare system instead of to atmosphere;\r\n\r\n2)Isobutylene railcar unloading connections were changed to inherently safer dry-lock fittings;\r\n\r\n3)Internal excess flow valves were installed in the storage vessels on the primary liquid and vapor transfer nozzles;\r\n\r\n4)External excess flow valves and  leak-free thermometer thermowells were installed on small vessel appurtenances on the storage vessels;\r\n\r\n5)Additional LEL detection systems with shutdown interlocks were installed in pipe rack locations that contain isobutylene piping;\r\n\r\n6)Several process area fixed fire extinguishing systems were interlocked to shut down isobutylene equipm"
