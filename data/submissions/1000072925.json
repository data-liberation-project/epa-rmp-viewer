Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This is evidenced through our Core Values found in the Brenntag Cornerstone.  The six (6)core values of Brenntag Connecting Chemistry  are: SAFETY FIRST, LEADERSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY, EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND OWNERSHIP, COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE, Integrity Responsibility, and Value Creation for Partners CONTINUOUS.  As stated by Mr. William A. Filder, President & CEO of Brenntag North America and Latin America; \"Nothing we do can ever become more important than our safety performance.\" and \"There is not business goal worth asking people to sacrifice what they value most in life.\"  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with ORLANDO FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Orlando facility's primary activities include the repackaging and distribution of chemical products.  We have three (3) regulated substances present at the Orlando facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine is received into Orlando in 180,000 pound railcars.  Chlorine is repackaged in different  containers and used to produce bleach (sodium hypochlorite)for distribution to our customers.  The Sulfur Dioxide containers are packaged at our Henderson, KY facility and"
