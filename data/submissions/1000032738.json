Corning Concord's prevention program complies with all applicable U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program regulations codified under 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n\r\nCorning Concord maintains a management system to oversee the implementation of and compliance with all elements of the RMP regulations.  This management system, along with other Corning Concord policies, provides a means to eliminate and/or reduce the potential for hazardous chemical releases at the plant.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program Level 3\r\n\r\nCorning Concord is a Program 3 facility.  Therefore, Corning Concord's prevention program provides for policies, procedures, and systems that address all elements of the RMP concerning Program Level 3 facilities and implementation procedures.  Corning Concord's prevention program also addresses the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program elements, which are similar to those required by the RMP regulations.

The site is located at 14556 Highway 601 South, Midland, Cabarrus County, North Carolina.  The Corning Concord plant currently employs approximately 550 full-time employees engaged in the manufacture of fiber optics.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Substance\r\n\r\nChlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant that exceeds the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68; therefore, chlorine is the only substance at the plant for which the RMP regulations apply.  The chlorine storage and distribution system is contained in a specially designed process building.  The majority of the chlorine utilized at the facility is contained with the Bulk Chlorine Storage Building that is equipped with vent make-up and exhaust scrubber systems.  The chlorine process was installed as part of the fiber optic manufacturing process.  Chlorine is received, stored and distributed to four (4) control panels.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2 and serves as a chlorinating or oxidizing agent.  Chlorine is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and OSHA listed toxic chemical, an irritant, and a corrosive substance.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen or a flammable substance.  OSHA's ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for chlorine is 1 ppm.  The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) lists chlorine with a health rating of 4 (severe) with immediate and delayed health hazards.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 \tREMOVED 2007 - Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios (40 CFR 68.155(c))  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0 \tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Progr"

The building is equipped with temperature controls and make-up vents.  The building is operated under negative pressure created by the vent scrubber.  There are two (2) modes of vent operations:  normal and emergency.
