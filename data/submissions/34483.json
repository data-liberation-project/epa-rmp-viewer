      "SummaryText": "      The ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Resin Finishing Plant is a quality producer of hydrocarbon resins.  Our products are used throughout the adhesives industry to provide \" tack \" to such familiar products as bandaids, tape, glue sticks, and diaper tabs.  Located at 12480 Scenic Highway, Baton Rouge, La., the plant has been in business at the same location since 1968.\n      \n      A physical separation of resin from solvent occurs at the ExxonMobil Resin Finishing Plant. All process chemistry occurs at the ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Chemical Plant. A brief description of the physical separation is as follows:    \n      \n       1)  Resin concentrate ( feed ) is shipped via pipeline from the Baton Rouge Chemical Plant and received in the Finishing Plant storage tanks. \n       2)  From the storage tanks the feed is pumped to stripping towers where solvent and light molelular weight resins are taken overhead and returned to the chemical plant.\n       3)  The molten resin product is taken off the bottom of the towers and pumped to molten resin storage tanks.\n       4)  From the molten resin storage tanks the molten resin is then processed into one of various finished packaged forms.\n\n      Pentane, a colorless liquid with a \" gasoline \" odor, is the sole chemical on site that exceeds the threshold limits set for a flammable chemical as set by the federal government.  It is used as a raw material component in resin production and exists on site as a recovered overhead from the stripping process.  Total loss of containment of tank 502 ( which contains as much as 3,600,000 lbs. of a flammable mixture with pentane in it ), under the worst possible weather conditions, and an ensuing vapor cloud explosion of this mixture, would be the worst case scenario for a flammable at the Resin Finishing Plant.  Offsite impact  for this scenario as determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines would extend for 1.2 miles.\n\n      The alternative release scenario for the Resin Finis"

      "SummaryText": "hing Plant would be a tank or piping leak within tank 502 dike wall and a subsequent pool fire.  Distance of concern for this scenario would be 0.14 miles.  The amount of flammable mixture available would be 68,000 lbs.\n\n      There are no toxic chemicals on site that exceed threshold limits.\n\n      The ExxonMobil Resin Finishing Plant complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  Compliance is achieved via twenty-one corporate requirements called the Operations Integrity Management Practices ( OIMP ).  The OIMPs were developed by subject matter experts and have undergone extensive reviews and improvement cycles.  These OIMPs have previously been listed in section 7 ( Prevention Program ).\n\n       The Emergency Response Program at the Baton Rouge Resin Finishing Plant is an integral part of the safety system.  Comprehensive emergency response proceures coordinate on site responders with local E.R. personnel, industry, and public agencies.  Mobile and fixed fire protection equipment ( including fire trucks and an in-ground firewater system ) are maintained on site.  Emergency response personnel ( including fire fighters and first responders ) train on an annual basis to maintain certification.  Plant-wide simulated emergencies are coordinated with area E.R. groups.\n\n      The end result of the release prevention and emergency response facilities is no RMP releases for the site over the last ten years.  Continued adherence to and improvement of the systems now in place will ensure that safety  within the facility and the surrounding area will continue at the highest level."
