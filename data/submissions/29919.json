The facility is new and has no accidental release history.\n\nUpon completion of the PSM, the RMP program was formulated.  The RMP team (Mike Walker, David Bryant and Mike Elliott who are all knowledgeable in the process) found the facility and its construction to be in compliance with PSM and RMP.  The Process Hazard analysis was reviewed and found to be in order.  The 13 elements of the PSM program were reviewed (audited) and found to be in good order.  The emergency response program and plan were reviewed and found to be in good order. Items that were planned to improve safety (few were required) were included on a management plan after the PHA was completed."
