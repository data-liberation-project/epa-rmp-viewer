      "SummaryText": "On May 22, 2002, in preparation for opening the new AmeriCold Logistics freezer storage facility at 720 Butler Drive, Murfreesboro TN, and because anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) will be used in the refrigeration process, the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Planning (RMP) programs were reviewed and  implemented. The facility is new and has no accidental release history.\n\nUpon completion of the PSM, the RMP program was formulated.  The RMP team (Mike Walker, David Bryant and Mike Elliott who are all knowledgeable in the process) found the facility and its construction to be in compliance with PSM and RMP.  The Process Hazard analysis was reviewed and found to be in order.  The 13 elements of the PSM program were reviewed (audited) and found to be in good order.  The emergency response program and plan were reviewed and found to be in good order. Items that were planned to improve safety (few were required) were included on a management plan after the PHA was completed."
