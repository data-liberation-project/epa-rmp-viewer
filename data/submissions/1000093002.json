Facility Policy.\r\n\r\n   The owners, management and employees of Twin State, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work \r\n   with the local fire department, Rock County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information.\r\n\r\n   The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of fertilizer products.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and manufacturing anhydrous ammonia-based fertilizers as a \r\n   nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n   Consistent with the compliance guidelines of 29 CFR Part 1910 and 40 CFR Part 68, this facility has developed a management system to minimize consequences associated with manufacturing anhydrous ammonia-based \r\n   fertilizers.\r\n\r\n   Twin State, Inc. has its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and developed emergency plans.  This program provides plans and information that will assist emergency responders in the event of an accident at \r\n   this facility.\r\n\r\n   Finally, the management system provides procedures and plans to assist employees in conducting both routine and non-routine plant operations, to identify potential hazardous situations, and to respond to actual \r\n   emergencies.\r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\n   The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations \r\n   covering anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\n   The facility personnel are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving policies"

In the unlikely event of a release, we have an emergency action plan in place to minimize potential effects.\r\n\r\n   The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\r\n   Twin State, Inc. facility has one regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a horizontal pressurized tank.\r\n\r\n   The reacts anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid (68%, CAS No. 7664-38-2).  This process uses TVA Pipe Reactor (T-Reactor) technology to neutralize the phosphoric acid with ammonia.  The resultant liquid \r\n   product is an ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer, N-P-K, labeled as 10-34-0.   This product is only used for crop production.\r\n\r\n4. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\n   The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) / DEGADIS-generated Lookup Tables were used to perform offsite consequences analysis.  The following two paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\r\n\r\n   The worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  In this scenario, ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The gaseous ammonia is released at Class F \r\n   stability with 1.5 m/s wind-speed.  \r\n\r\n   The alternative-case scenario involves the release of ammonia over a 2-minute period.  Ammonia is assumed to be released in gaseous form.  The release is assumed to be controlled by excess flow valves, \r\n   emergency shutdown and/or emergency response procedures.  Weather conditions are assumed to be neutral.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\r\n\r\nThis facility has taken steps to comply with accidental release prevention.
