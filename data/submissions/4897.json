Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Midwest Ag Development in Grand Rapids are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the LaMoure Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 18,000 and 12,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in Grand Rapids\n(Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tanks (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2)."

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 100.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMidwest Ag Development maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nMidwest Ag Development maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within\nour covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation;\nthe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nMidwest Ag Development has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\nprocesses.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMidwest Ag Development conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\nensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified pe"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Midwest Ag Development to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nMidwest Ag Development routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes\nand modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nMidwest Ag Development conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the\nplan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance\nissue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMidwest Ag Development truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention\nis a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning\naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5.
