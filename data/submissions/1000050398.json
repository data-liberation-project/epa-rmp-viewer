A primary aspect of this commitment is the implementation of a Prevention Program to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the City of Toledo Water Division uses industry recommended procedures and equipment designed to contain and neutralize the release on site in a manner that will be safe for our employees.  Personnel receive thorough training in emergency response procedures. Emergency planning is coordinated with the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the City of Toledo Water Division established a management system to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n2.0  City of Toledo Water Division Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Toledo Water Division Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.

These documents are used to:\n\n* train employees,\n\n* perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n\n* maintain the equipment.\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Chlorination Process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe City of Toledo Water Division Water Treatment Plant performed and will periodically update process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Chlorination Process to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTo perform the PHAs, City of Toledo Water Division Water Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation & maintenance and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorination Process is no longer in operation.  The results, findings and resolutions of these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\n3.3  Operating Procedures\n\nCity of Toledo Water Division engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Chlorination Process operation should be safely performed. Operating procedures are reviewed annually to ensure they are accurate and up to date. These written procedures address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n* normal startup,\n\n* normal operations,\n\n* temporary operations,\n\n* emergency shutdown,\n\n* normal shutdown, and\n\n* initial startup of a new process.\n\n  The written operating procedures include:\n\n* steps for safely conducting process tasks,\n\n* applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations, steps to correct or avoid deviations and\n\n* safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and action(s) to take in the event of an exposure to a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\n3.4  Training\n\nThe City of Toledo Water Division Water Treatment Plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.
