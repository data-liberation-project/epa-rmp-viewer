The San Antonio Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of San Antonio, TX. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\nMotiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva) - San Antonio Terminal in San Antonio, TX is committed to operating and maintaining processes in\na safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Motiva believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the\nenvironment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\nThe San Antonio Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health\nand safety of our employees, contractors and the community. Motiva promotes health, safety, and the environment through\nprograms of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release\nprevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management\nactivities that Motiva has designed and implemented, including:\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe primary function of the San Antonio Terminal, located in San Antonio, Texas is to act as a refined petroleum distribution facility.\nThe butane blending process has been classified as Program Level 3"

      "SummaryText": ". No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated\nsubstances were identified. By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize\nthe threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Motiva Enterprises LLC - San Antonio Terminal is strongly committed\nto employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is\nhandled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is\nprovided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the San Antonio Terminal.\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel.\nSpecifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel).\nThe butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site\ngasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid and Bartec-Benke Analyzer. Process safety\ncontrols include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill\nshutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and\ngrounding/interlock devices. Access to the San Antonio Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and\nauthorized contractors/visitors.\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\nOur accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the\nhazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees,"
