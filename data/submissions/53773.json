The process includes varies refrigerating equipment:plate freezers, ice makers, water chillers, and a blast freezer.There are both flooded and liquid recirculation type of system within the refrigeration system.  There is one low pressure reciever, two high pressure recievers, one control pressure reciever, one inter-cooler, one pre-cooler, and several surge drums. The compressors are most screw type, but there is one reciprocating compressor.  There are two evaporative condensers.",

To strive for a coordinated and affective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.  There is a single person identified as having overall responsibility for these programs.  Most all of the program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review.  A follow-up report of the audit is generated to improve any program elements found, or felt to need improvement.  A process hazard analysis is done for the entire system, and repeated every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated for the hazard analysis to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Trident Seafoods intent that the PSM/RMP for the Newport, Oregon facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  Following the work practices implemented at the facility only incidental released of ammonia have occurred due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear.\n\nRelease Considerations\nFollowing program guidelines a ?Worse Case? release of ammonia was analyzed.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report.  The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential concern as determined in the ?Process Hazard Analysis? of the system and facility.  The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency action plan for the facility, and for coordination with loca"

If any actual release occurred, or even a near miss, an incident investigation would be done to determine the cause, and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\nTrident Seafoods Newport, Oregon facility has a written ?Emergency Response Plan? that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release.  Many of the operating personnel have been trained to the Hazmat Technician level, and do receive annual refresher training.  However, at this time they will only do ?defensive? actions in the event of an ammonia release, but are working at development of personnel and equipment to establish an emergency response plan.  The facility works with the local emergency responders on an annual basis to assure good coordination between on-site and off-site resource for an ammonia release as well as other emergency.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvement\n This facility holds monthly safety meetings with all Management Staff, Lead Personnel and other team members where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment.  Engineering staff meetings are held weekly during system operation.  Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety and operational improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon.  Systems and procedures are reviewed and updated; in many cases at least annually to assure that all operations are being done is a safe and effective manner."
