CCD also stores ammonia > 20%\nThe accidental release prevention program utilized at CCD Company consists of elements required by the EPA Risk Management Plan.  CCD also has an emergency response program that meets the regulatory requirements of the standard.  Additional details regarding the prevention and emergency response programs are provided in this plan.\nThe worst case scenario involves the loss of the maximum amount of hydroflouric acid and ammonia in a single vessel (500 LBS and 380 LBS respectively) in a diked area.  Details regarding the hazard assesments are included in this plan.  Also, a scenario involving an alternative release of the same size is included.\nCascade has had no incidents in the last 5 years.  Cascade takes great pride in their safety, environmental and risk handling systems.  These systems have proven effective in the past and will be continually improved as better procedures are determined in the future.\nWe are a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors and are in conformance with The Responsible Distribution Process."
