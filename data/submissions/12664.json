Our plant treats an average 2.0 MGD it is a areated lagoon system consisting of 6 ponds\n     4 ponds aerated an 2 ponds as polishing ponds. Post treatment includes disinfecting with Chlorine.\n\nIII.  The worst case release scenario for chlorine would be the failure of a pressurized chlorine cylinder\n     valve, and the sudden release of it's contents (2000lbs) in 10 minutes. The distance would 0.9 miles\n     as determined by the EPA's PMP* Comp.\n\n     The alternative release scenario would be a valve sheared off releasing 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine\n     in 15 minutes. The distance to the toxic end point would be 0.2 miles as determined by the EPA's RMP*\n     Comp.\n\nIV.
