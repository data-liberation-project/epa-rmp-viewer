Sound health,safety, and the enviroment\n      practices are an integral part of our everyday job requirements.\n\n     In recognition of this responsibility, we will correct an unsound health, safety, and enviromental practice\n     or condition, or call them to the attention of those who willdo so, as soon as they are identified.\n\n    We will conduct our operations in compliance with all applicable health, safety, and enviromental laws\n    and regulations per the GA EPD or USEPA.\n\n    Conduct periodic assessment of our operations to insure compliance and reduce risk.\n\n    Provide education and training regarding applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures to \n    protect human healthand acheive continuous improvement.\n\nII.  The Spirit Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has been treating wastewater for our customers for \n     past 11 years providing quality wastewater treatment in a safe manner to our community and \n     enviroment. Our plant treats an average 2.0 MGD it is a areated lagoon system consisting of 6 ponds\n     4 ponds aerated an 2 ponds as polishing ponds. Post treatment includes disinfecting with Chlorine.\n\nIII.  The worst case release scenario for chlorine would be the failure of a pressurized chlorine cylinder\n     valve, and the sudden release of it's contents (2000lbs) in 10 minutes. The distance would 0.9 miles\n     as determined by the EPA's PMP* Comp.\n\n     The alternative release scenario would be a valve sheared off releasing 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine\n     in 15 minutes. The distance to the toxic end point would be 0.2 miles as determined by the EPA's RMP*\n     Comp.\n\nIV. The Spirit Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has not had any reportable accidental releases of \n      chlorine (3ppm) in the last five years.\n\nV.
