Within the corporate limits, is the City of Amarillo potable water treatment plant having a current treatment capacity of seventy million gallons of water per day (mgd).  The plant capacity was increased to seventy mgd on June 1, 2001.  The plant operates on a 24 hour day schedule utilizing thirty employees onsite during normal business hours.  At night and during irregular work hours, two employees are always on duty at the facility.  An additional fifteen employees work normal business hours on the treatment plant grounds at the City's separate Environmental Laboratory.  A maximum of twenty four tons of chlorine gas (Cl2) in one ton containers is stored onsite, with a maximum of six containers being connected and online at any one time.\n\nHazard Assessment Information\n40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B - Hazard Assessment, outlines a specific set of criteria required to be used in the modeling of worst case and most probable case release scenarios.  Worst case and most probable case scenario modeling was completed using Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospeheres (ALOHA) software.\n\nTo complete most probable case and worst case scenario plume models, the default level of concern for chlorine was set at levels estblished at EPA and American Industrial Hygiene Asociation guidance.  The resulting plume indicates a level where individuals would be able to take protective actions without suffering any serious health effects from a chemical exposure during a one hour or less period.  Most probable case and worst case scenario plume analysis results are conservative estimates based on the ALOHA software, using RMP release and meteorological requirements.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe written Prevention Plan for the Osage Water Treatment Plant comprehensively deals with requiremetns of 40 CFR, Part 68, sections 68."

The training program has been developed, operations and maintenance SOP's are written and have been implemented.  The hazard review has been performed and suggestions resulting from it have been implemented.  The compliance audit, which is an internal audit, has been written and implemented and incident investigations forms are in place.  All of the above elements of the Program 2 Prevention Program are kept in a unified binder format.  Continuing requirements of the program will be carried out on the schedules required by the Risk Management Program Rule.\n\nEmergency Response Information\nA controlled release of chlorine gas (Cl2) product located on the water treatment plant site shall be defined as the escape of gas to the atmosphere in small, non-reportable quantities, resulting from standard operating procedures to connect chlorine gas (Cl2) containers and standard maintenance procedures on the water treatment plant chlorine gas (Cl2) delivery system.  Minor leaks in the system that can be promptly repaired or shut-off shall also be considered a controlled release.\n\nAn uncontrolled release of chlorine gas (Cl2) which will require the implementation of emergency response procedures is defined as  any release other than those examples defined as similar to controlled releases.  Emergency response to the Osage Plant will be made by the Amarillo Fire Department, in accordance with Amarillo Fire Department hazardous materials response procedures.  If uncontrolled release conditions warrant such actions, shelter-in-place, evacuation and public warning will be implemented by the Amarillo/Potter/Randall Department of Emergency Management.  Any uncontrolled release of chlorine gas (Cl2) shall be subject to an after action incident investigation by the City Environmental Health and Risk Management Departments, exclusive of State and Federal agency regulatory review and oversight.\n\nThis fac"

      "SummaryText": "ility had an uncontrolled release of approximately 106 pounds of chlorine on February 8, 2008.  This was the result of mechanical failure in the drip legs of the piping system.  As a result the chemical was relesed into a containment building where automatic shutoff valves and scrubbers controlled the release.  No chlorine was released to the environment and no injuries resulted from the accident."
