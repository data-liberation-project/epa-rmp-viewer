Introduction\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan of 3M/Dyneon in Decatur, AL .  We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company?s history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 80 percent, and releases to water 75 percent. \n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our best efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release. We also maintain an excellent working relationship with the Decatur Fire Department who can provide additional rapid and effective response. \n \n3. The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe manufacture specialty films and specialty chemicals for use in making a wide variety of products.  We use 4 regulated substances at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA?s Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance. \n\nThe following regulated substances are used at 3M/Dyneon Decatur:\n\n     Methyamine is a key raw material used in the production of tape products.\n     \n     Propylene, Vinylidene fluoride, and Trifluorochloroethylene are used as raw materials in the production of synthetic rubber and pla"

Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nEPA has directed all affected facilities to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at the facility, as unlikely as that might be, and an alternative, more realistic, accident scenario. To evaluate the worst case scenario, we have used the RMP Comp computerized program provided by the EPA.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have also employed the RMP Comp program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe 3M Decatur site has considered two worst case release scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class.  One scenario involves a catastrophic release from the Propylene Storage Tank in the Propylene storage and transfer process.  The scenario involves the release of 68,500 lb. of Propylene.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nA second worst case scenario involves the unlikely complete release of 120,000 lbs. of Vinylidene Fluoride from a failure of one of the 16,100-gallon storage tanks.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release of the entire contents of a storage vessel when it contains a typical operating capacity of 50%, or 60,000 lbs of VDF.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire.   U"

Following is a brief description of the steps we take to prevent accidental releases:\n     \n     Storage Volume Reduction ? At 3M/Dyneon we examine opportunities to reduce the volume of chemicals stored on our site, thereby reducing the potential impact of an accident involving those chemicals. \n\n     Process Safety Information - We maintain a record of safety information that helps us conduct our operations safely. This information describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with appropriate processes. The information is used in process training for employees and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. The information is reviewed for any appropriate improvements.\n\n     Process Hazard Analysis - With the support of 3M corporate specialists, we conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that potential hazards associated with certain hazardous processes are identified and controlled effectively.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. These studies are revalidated at regular intervals of no more than five years or whenever significant changes are made in affected operations. Findings from the hazard analysis are presented so that they can be addressed in a timely manner.\n\n     Operating Procedures ? To"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.\n \n     Training - At 3M/Dyneon, we have a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees who are operating hazardous processes understand and are well trained in the correct operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided.\n \n     Mechanical Integrity ? We conduct and document in detail maintenance checks on hazardous process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and instrumentation, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are conducted by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices or other specialized subjects as needed.  Equipment deficiencies are identified so that they can be corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\n     Management of Change ? We have established written procedures to manage changes in process materials, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other appropriate employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are notified and provided any needed training. \n\n     Pre-startup Reviews - These safety reviews for new processes and modifications to established processes are conducted as a regular practice.   These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing certain equipment into operation. \n\n     Compliance Audits - Utilizing accepted audit practices, we regularly conduct audits to determine whether the procedures identified above are being properly implemented.

We promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a substantial release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future. \n\n     Employee Participation - At 3M/Dyneon, we have found through experience that managing process safety and preventing accidents are team efforts. We strongly encourage 3M employees to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  \n  \n     Contractors - On occasion, 3M/Dyneon hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the contractor?s safety performance. We have a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to our processes and the contractor?s work.  Contractors are also informed of our procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.   \n\n6. Five-year Accident History\n At 3M/Dyneon , no level of accident is acceptable.  We work continually to reduce the number and severity of accidents at our operations.  Within the past five years there have been no significant releases of regulated substances from our facility\n\n7. Emergency Response Plan\n3M?s first line of defense against accidents is to take action to prevent them, as described elsewhere in this executive summary.  However, we also work to ensure that we are prepared for any accident that might happen. We maintain a written emergency response plan that includes arrangements for immediate response from employees, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas. \nWe conduct regular drills including joint training with the Decatu"
