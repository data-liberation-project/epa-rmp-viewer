      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nLower Bucks County Joint Municipal Authority (LBCJMA) owns, operates and maintains a Water Filtration Plant (WFP).  The LBCJMA accident release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The LBCJMA's emergency response policy plans are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and are in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe chlorination system has been installed at the LBCJMA Water Filtration Plant to provide prechlorination and post chlorination for disinfection purpose.  The LBCJMA Water Filtration Plant (also referred to as Water Treatment Plant) provides portable water supply to Tullytown Borough and portions of Bristol Township, Middletown Township and Falls Township.  The chlorination facility is located within the LBCJMA Water Filtration Plant.  The chlorination system installed is a vacuum type with vacuum piping.  The chlorination system is installed in a room.  The chlorination facility is designed to place and connect four chlorine cylinders to the wall mounted vacuum regulator.  However, only two one-ton chlorine cylinders are turned on.  The chlorine facility is equipped with five (5) leak detection and automatic chlorine shut of systems (ROBO Control).  Each chlorine cylinder located in the weighing room connected to the chlorine feed manifold is provided with leak detection and automatic cylinder valve shut off system.  One leak detection and automatic valve shut off control is also installed with manifold to automatically shut off the main valve located on the manifold line.  Generally, there are eight (8) cylinders which are stored in a chlorine cylinder storage area.  The chlorination facility is normally unmanned.  The Water Treatment Plant operators visit the facili"

EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe EPA's RMP* Comptm model was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00c2\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the LBCJMA WFP Chlorination Facility involves a failure of two one-ton containers.  However, it should be noted that each chlorine cylinder connected to a chlorine feed manifold is provided with a chlorine leak detection system and an automatic valve shut system (ROBO Control System), the maximum quantity of chlorine that could be released is expected to be limited to a very small quantity.  This is because the automatic valve shut off system will immediately shut off valves of chlorine cylinders and manifold as soon as it detects any chlorine leak. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for the set of"

      "SummaryText": "conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount of a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, temperate of 25\u00c2\u00b0C (77\u00c2\u00b0F), and average humidity (50%) were used.\n\nWhen analysis of the worst-case scenario was performed using RMP* Comptm model and using the EPA assumptions and considering release of chlorine gas in an enclosed space, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 10,805 was obtained.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the break or rupture of the flexible connections (pigtails) or valves connected to two (2) one-ton cylinders, possibly due to corrosion.  The amount of chlorine released is 4,000 lbs, at an average rate over one hour (the duration of the release) of 67 lbs/min.  Toxic endpoint distance to ERPG-2 levels was obtained.  The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed 3 m/s, average air temperature of 25\u00c2\u00b0C, and 50% average humidity.  The estimated distances traveled to the toxic endpoints are 0.1 miles for the ERPG-2 and an estimated residential population potentially affected of 34 was obtained.\n\nSince the chlorine cylinder weighing room and the chlorine feeding system/chlorinators are located within the room, enclosure is considered as a passive mitigation system.  Actuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure considered.  An additional mitigation system, LBCJMA has installed chlorine leak detection and automatic valve shut off valve, a vacuum type chlorination system, with all pressurized chlorine gas piping replaced with vacuum piping.
