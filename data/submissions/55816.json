Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and employees of Western Farm Service, 21929 Lassen Road, Five Points, California are committed to the prevention of a release of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia and pesticides.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary business at the facility is to sell fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agro-nomic services to growers and ranchers.  To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\nA. Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and pack-aged containers of agricultural chemicals and packaged seed.  All fertilizer, agricul-tural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers.  No mixing or formulating of agricultural chemicals occurs at the facility.\n\nB. Ten agricultural pesticides stored in the Chemical Warehouse are regulated sub-stances.  The maximum process quantities (in pounds of active ingredient) of the regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse are:  Azinphos Methyl (36 pounds); Carbofuran (220 pounds); Dimethoate (715 pounds); Endosulfan (100 pounds); Fenamiphos (85 pounds); Methamidophos (1440 pounds); Oxamyl 120 pounds); Paraquat Dichloride (264 pounds); Phorate (792 pounds) and Phosmet (70 pounds).\n\nC. Anhydrous Ammonia is received and stored at the facility.  It is distributed to grow-ers for use as a plant nutrient.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used, at the facility, in the manufacturing of Aqua Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck and stored in an 18,064-gallon capacity aboveground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammo"

It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient.  Aqua Ammonia is stored in two 22,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia handled at the facility is 334,400 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative release scenarios for the regulated substances at the CPS- Five Points facility have been calculated.  They are not reported in the Executive Summary but are in the complete program text.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nWFS Five Points has comprehensive written programs and procedures to comply with the CalARP RMP program regulations.  Key to getting all programs and procedures in place was (1) having the facility management understand what the CalARP RMP regulations required and (2) developing and implementing specific written programs, written procedures and practices to meet those regulations.\n\nFacility management and employees involved in any of the covered processes have been trained and made aware of the provisions and requirements in the programs and practices.\n\nCompliance audits and general inspections by Western Farm Service corporate staff is the next key for ensuring the facility remains in compliance.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History \n\nIn the past five years, there have been no releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Am-monia or any of the ten regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse that have caused any deaths, injuries or property damage at the facility nor resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan.  The local fire department has conducted a facility visit specifically addressing the response to releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia and products stored in the Chemical Warehouse.  Tw"
