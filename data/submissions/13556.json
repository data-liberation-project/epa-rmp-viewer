The program covers anhydrous ammonia, which is utilized at the Glacier Foods facility as a refrigerant. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the Glacier Foods facility (Plant #1, 2, and 3) is 9,000 gallons (approximately 45,500 lbs.).\n\nThe RMP has been prepared in accordance with CalARP Final Regulations pursuant to 19CCR'2735 to 2785 and with local requirements prescribed by Fresno County Environmental Health. \n\nWorst case and alternative case (most probable) accidental releases for anhydrous ammonia were assessed.  The scenarios are:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Worst Case:        Release of largest vessel over a 10-minute period\nRadius to Toxic Endpoint: 1.5 miles\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Probable Case:     Faulty Valve Packing\nRadius to Toxic Endpoint:  0.12 miles\n\nThe Glacier Foods facility has developed a schedule for implementing measures to mitigate the effects and limit the distances for the reported scenarios.  The risk reduction recommendations include developing additional written operating procedures and preventive maintenance procedures, maintaining hot work procedures, maintaining current inspection procedures and developing additional inspection procedures for the ammonia system, maintain operator training programs, developing a pre-startup safety review program and a management of change program. \n\nThe Glacier Foods facility has had only two accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years. \n\nThe Glacier Foods facility has a written Emergency Action Plan that includes specific actions to be taken by facility employees in response to accidental releases of ammonia.  The Glacier Foods facility has 40-hour Hazwoper trained individuals on-site.  The Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for coordinating with local agencies responding to accidental releases and informing the public.  A written emergency action plan for releases of ammonia is covered"
