      "SummaryText": "Springfield Pipeline, LLC (Springfield) owns and operates the Stanley CDP.  The Stanley CDP is a newly constructed facility that will receive production from area oil and gas wells via flowline. The production is treated to separate gas, water and condensate. The gas is further processed through a cryogenic process involving the rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which condenses the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in to a pressurized bullet tank with a volume of 12,000 gallons and operating pressure of ~200 psi.\n\nA total rupture of the 12,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Stanley CDP. The 12,000 gallon tank has been\nevaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.2 miles. No public receptors are within a 0.2 mile radius of the NGL tank. The worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. The Stanley CDP is located in a remote area and is not normally occupied.\n\nSince the facility is newly constructed, there is no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Stanley CDP NGL system occur, it is SpringfieldA?s policy to notify the Laredo Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the fire department.\n"
