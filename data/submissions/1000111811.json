      "SummaryText": "ion Plan that will be put into effect in the event of a hazardous chemical release. This plan provides guidelines to assure that hazardous material (HAZMAT) emergencies are handled in a manner consistent with current regulations and safety practices. The plan is intended to cover all releases of hazardous chemicals regardless of size. Although a small spill or leak does not entail the same complex response mechanism as a massive release, it still has the potential to produce localized injury or damage. The intent of this plan is to assure that all plant personnel approach every HAZMAT incident from an informed perspective. In this way, adequate precautions can be taken to minimize the degree of hazard to our employees and the public.  \n\n  During a hazardous material emergency at the plant, a trained supervisor will take charge of response activities. The trained supervisor will first assess whether the release is considered emergency or incidental. Incidental releases will be handled by plant personnel, while emergency releases will require a response by the Branson Fire Department.  \n\n              The Compton Drive Action Plan details response activities of trained HAZMAT personnel and lines of communications and authority between responders from Police, Fire, and Public Works departments. The plan also describes specific responsibilities of trained individuals, as well as steps of mobilization, mitigation and types of safety equipment needed. Clean-up procedures and levels of training to perform clean up are described. Also included are methods of accident prevention, instructions for evaluation and follow-up meetings to review problems encountered during the response and ways to improve response time and communications in the event of a future incident. The plan will be exercised as needed so procedures can be updated as necessary.   \n\n  \n\nWe believe this plan to be comprehensive, informative, and adequate."

      "SummaryText": "ly. Employees who handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide are required to receive extensive training prior to working with either chemical and must be involved in continuous training to stay up to date with safety practices. Chlorination is a safe and effective way to disinfect treated wastewater before it is discharged into a receiving stream. Chlorine is shipped to the site in 1-ton gas cylinders. A vacuum system is used to remove the chlorine from the cylinder at a specified rate. Should the system fail, causing loss of vacuum, regulators mounted directly to the cylinder valve will close to prevent any loss of chlorine into the atmosphere. After the chlorine has had sufficient time to disinfect the effluent waters sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the plant effluent just before it enters Lake Taneycomo. The same type of vacuum system used in chlorination is also used to feed sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is shipped to the plant in 150 lb cylinders. The amount of sulfur dioxide that is stored is always below the 5,000lbs threshold quantity of the regulated substances.     \n\nIn addition to all of this the Compton WWTF is also having a metal wall installed that will completely surround all of the Compton WWTF except for the driveway entrance to the plant. This project is set to be complete September of 2024. The wall\u0092s main function is to prevent the Compton WWTF from being flooded from Lake Taneycomo. This will also assist with keeping the equipment safe from flooding, providing better protection from malicious intent of the hazardous chemicals, and better keep spills contained onsite in the case of an unforeseen release of hazardous chemicals.   \n\n  \n\n            As of June 21, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency requires that all facilities which store and use chemicals such as chlorine in quantities greater than 2500 pounds, to establish a risk management program. The Risk Management Program for the Compton Drive Wastewater Treatment Plant includes an Act"

      "SummaryText": "The Compton Drive Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Branson, Missouri, has been in operation since 1988. It is designed to treat 5.3 million gallons of wastewater per day. The facility is located next to Lake Taneycomo on approximately 4 acres of land that is equal or lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. The plant is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week by experienced, certified operators, under the direction of an Operations Manager.  \n\n  \n\nA lab and office building occupy the site along with an equipment building, a centrifuge building, 4 oxidation basins, 4 clarifiers, chlorine basins and sand filters, 2 waste sludge tanks, and 3 sludge holding basins. Chemical and biological nutrient removal systems were added in 1995 to remove phosphorus and enhance the quality of the plant effluent.  \n\n  \n\n            Chemicals used on site are Potassium Permanganate, liquid Polymer, Liquid Alum, Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide. Each of these chemicals are potentially hazardous if not handled properly. Potassium Permanganate is metered into the waste sludge flow at a specified rate to reduce odors in the sludge holding basins. It is considered hazardous because of its ability to accelerate the burning of combustible materials and the irritating effects caused by its dust or mist. Gloves, respirators, and eye protection are used when handling this chemical.   \n\n            During the final step of phosphorus removal, liquid alum is used to coagulate suspended solids in the effluent, prior to filtration. We receive liquid alum in bulk form. It is then stored in 3, 3000 gallon bulk storage tanks which sit in a containment area that will catch any spills which might occur. This chemical is considered hazardous because of its toxic fumes, low pH, and corrosive nature.  \n\n  \n\n            The remaining two chemicals are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Both of these chemicals are extremely hazardous in their gas or compressed liquid form if not handled proper"
