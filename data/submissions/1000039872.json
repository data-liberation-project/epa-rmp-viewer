The audit team reviews documentation and records, inspects the site and interviews personnel to determine compliance.  The audit team then develops findings that are forwarded to the refinery management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is tracked, documented and the two most recent audits are retained onsite as part of the PSM file.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe processes at SWRC have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized above is applied to our program Level 3 RMP-covered processes.  The prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program, SWRC has safety features on many units to help contain/control releases, detect releases and reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various process units:\r\n\r\n*\tRelease Detection \r\n*\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms \r\n*\tHYDROGEN SULFIDE detectors with alarms\r\n*\tRelease containment and control\r\n*\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a monitored flare system.  The flare captures and incinerates episodic releases.  (Monitored by a video camera)\r\n*\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and"

The fire resulted in significant property damage.\r\n*\tIn May of 2012, a fire occurred in the Gas Recovery Unit because of the release of butane. The butane was released due to operators draining a caustic wash vessel to refinery sewer.  The Caustic level became insufficient and allowed the butane to blow-through. Four operators working in the area were injured, three of which experienced severe burns and days away from work.\r\n*\tIn May of 2012, a fire occurred in the Alkylation unit because of bleeding a Butane pump to the atmosphere.  Two operators involved in the task were treated for burn injuries.\r\n*\tIn September of 2013, a fire occurred in the #4 HDS unit because of a valve flange failure that resulted in the release of hydrogen.  The fire resulted in significant property damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEM"

      "SummaryText": "ERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nSWRC maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\r\n\r\n*\tProper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\r\n*\tEvacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\r\n*\tNotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\r\n*\tCleanup and decontamination requirements \r\n\r\nIn addition, SWRC has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. \r\n\r\nEmployees receive, as part of their initial and ongoing refinery training, instructions and procedures for carrying out their specific duties. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes, changes in legal requirements, or refinery policy.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  The overall emergency response program for the SWRC is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  LEPC members include local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  SWRC has periodic meetings with the LEPC and has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations, including the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the periodic meetings, SWRC conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emer"
