Sinclair Wyoming Refining Company is official name of the refinery. \n\n\n\nDescription of Refinery Processes:\n\nSWRC includes modern process units typically used for production of petroleum fuels; atmospheric and vacuum distillation, hydrotreating, reforming, fluidized catalytic cracking, delayed coking, alkylation and associated supporting operations such as crude oil unloading, sulfur recovery, blending and crude oil/product storage and transport.  The NAICS code for the SWRC is 32411. \n\n\n\nDescription of Refinery Products:\n\nSWRC manufacturers the following generic products/by-products:\n\n\n\n*    Asphalt    \n\n*    Black Oil    \n\n*    Diesel Fuel    \n\n*    Fuel Oil     \n\n*    Gasoline    \n\n*    Jet Fuel    \n\n*    Liquefied Petroleum Gases\n\n*    Petroleum Coke\n\n*    Sulfur\n\n\n\nRMP Program - Definition of Processes and Regulated Substances: \n\nThe RMP rule defines a process as \"Any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\"  (Re: 40 CFR 68.3).  For petroleum refineries, RMP guidance recommends establishing process boundaries matching the PSM process boundaries.\n\n\n\nPer the RMP definition, SWRC has the following RMP regulated flammable substances in its processes:\n\n\n\n*    Hydrogen    \n\n*    Methane\n\n*    Ethane        \n\n*    Propane    \n\n*    n-Butane    \n\n*    Isobutane\n\n*    Pentane        \n\n*    Isopentane    \n\n*    Flammable Mixtures\n\n\n\nSWRC has the following regulated toxic substances in its processes:\n\n\n\n*    Hydrogen Sulfide\n\n*    Sulfur Dioxide\n\n*    Ammonia\n\n\n\nOf the above flammable and toxic substances, only flammable mixtures, n-Butane, Propane, and Isobutane exceed the R"

None of the toxic substances listed above exceed the threshold quantity for toxics.  Based upon threshold quantities and process definition, the SWRC is reporting the following eight processes in its RMP: \n\n\n\n*    582 Vacuum/Crude Unit\n\n*    581 Crude Unit\n\n*    Reformer, # 1 HDS, # 2 HDS, LEF, Naphtha Splitter, Amine Regeneration # 1, Amine Regeneration # 2\n\n*    780 Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit\n\n*    Gas Recovery, Straight Run Gas Recovery, Old Alky, Poly, New Alky, Slop Recovery and Propane Storage\n\n*    Tank Farm, Spheres\n\n*    Hydrocracker Unit  \n\n*    #4 HDS Unit  \n\n\n\nOther processes at the SWRC either do not have regulated flammable substances or contain such substances in quantities below the RMP applicability threshold.\n\n\n\nSWRC has multiple processes that contain Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide.  The maximum quantity of Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide in any process does not exceed 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  Ammonia is used in several processes in amounts less than 10,000 pounds at each process.  Because the quantities of these toxic substances are less than their respective RMP threshold values, none of the toxic substances are RMP reportable.  Nevertheless, SWRC has prevention and safety programs in place for these toxic substances as part of its PSM Program. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PROCESS SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nSWRC's accidental release prevention program includes the provisions of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program that is summarized below and includes the associated provisions of OSHA's Safety Management (PSM) Program.  SWRC works proactively to provide a safe workplace for each employee and continues to promote safety practices among employees for their health and welfare.  This is accomplished by actively assuring wide employee participation in a thorough Process PSM program"
