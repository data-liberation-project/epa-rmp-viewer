Written safe operating procedures, including emergency guidelines, that are reviewed annually;\n!    Regular preventive maintenance of critical equipment to prevent mechanical breakdowns;\n!    A tank integrity program that ensures safe storage of materials;\n!    Processes that are manned and monitored 24 hours a day;\n!    Safety systems that include emergency relief systems, remotely-activated isolation valves, and interlocking systems to shut down a process;\n!    Scheduled safety audits;\n!    Regular process hazard analysis to identify and correct potential safety concerns;\n!    Detailed safety reviews completed prior to startup following any changes made to our equipment or processes; and\n!    Thorough and regular safety and operational training for employees who work with processes that involve potentially hazardous materials.\n\nIn addition to the above, the chlorine dioxide process has these safety systems in place:\n\n!    All operators undergo extensive operator training and qualification programs;\n!    Storage tanks are diked;\n!    Chlorine dioxide is manufactured on-site and not transported from off-site;\n!    Continuous monitoring systems are in place for the production, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide within the mill, including extensive leak detection monitors; and\n!    Vented gas is captured in a collection system.\n\nThe chlorine process has these additional safety systems in place:\n\n!    All operators undergo extensive operator training and qualification program;\n!    Chlorine residuals are checked regularly;\n!    If water flow is lost to the system, gas flow is stopped; and\n!    Area atmosphere is continuously monitored and alarms will sound if chlorine is detected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the site consists of the catastrophic failure of Tank I with the release of 140,000 gallons of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solution (7,154 kilograms of ClO2) into a  dik"

EPA designated endpoint concentration out to a distance of 4.8 miles (7.8 kilometers) from Tank I.  The estimated population within this distance from the Covington Mill Tank I is approximately 2,900.  The one environmental receptor within this distance is a state forest.  The public receptors within this distance are public recreation areas, residences, schools, commercial and industrial facilities, office buildings, a correctional facility and churches.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide consists of the release of 100 gallons of  ClO2 solution (5.1 kilograms of ClO2) as a result of a failed gasket in the valve of a pipeline containing this solution at the Bleached Pulp Mill.  This alternative release scenario results in ClO2 concentrations that equal or exceed the U.S. EPA designated endpoint concentration to distances of 784 feet (239 meters) from the release point.  This area is entirely within the mill property.  Thus, there is no estimated population to be affected within this distance from the Bleached Pulp Mill.  Likewise, there are no environmental or public receptors within this distance from the release point.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of the release of 0.4 kilograms of Cl2 from failure of the lead gasket at the Cl2 container valve of one of the Cl2 containers at Paper Machine No. 2.  This alternative release scenario results in Cl2 concentrations that equal or exceed the U.S. EPA designated endpoint concentration to a distance of 171 feet (52 meters) from the release point.  This distance extends to slightly beyond MeadWestvaco?s boundary into Dunlap Creek; there is no affected population within this distance from Paper Machine No. 2.  There are no public receptors within this distance. There is one environmental receptor consisting of the public recreation area represented by Dunlap Creek.  \nA summa"

      "SummaryText": "ry of the results of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios is presented in Table 3-14.\n\nRegarding the five-year accident history, there have been no incidents at the Covington Mill over the past five years that resulted in injuries, death, or significant property damage on-site; nor have there been known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelterings in place, property damage or environmental damage associated with any of the regulated processes.\n\nThe site is also subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The purpose of this regulation and MeadWestvaco?s PSM program is to prevent accidental releases and to minimize the consequence if one should occur.  The location also has an Emergency Response Program in place that includes:\n\n!    Two full time nurses, a first aid squad, and a  firefighter team specifically including  structural firefighting  all on site;\n!    Participation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee; \n!    Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases;\n!    Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure;\n!    Procedures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n!    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance;\n!    Training of all employees in relevant procedures, and;\n!    Procedures to review and update the emergency action plan as appropriate.    \n\nEnsuring safe operations will continue to be a foremost priority for MeadWestvaco.  In that regard and as part of Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each covered process.  The most recent Process Hazard Analyses for chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been completed with all action items completed.  MeadWestvaco?s safety programs are audited internally on a periodic basis and modified or upgraded as needed to help ensure positive risk eliminatio"
