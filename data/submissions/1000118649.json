      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nJensen Meat is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\nJensen Meat's senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Jensen Meat's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Chief Operating Officer, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n-\tThe Jensen Meat facility is located at 2550 Britannia Blvd. in San Diego, California. \n\n-\tThe Jensen Meat ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems that cycle the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and heat transfer equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide cooling for the freezer, cold storage and processing areas.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the systems) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 18.6\"Hg on the low-pressure side of the system to 165.9 psig on the high side for System 1, 17\"Hg on the low-pressure side of the system to 174 psig o"

The total maximum inventory is 27,980 lbs. \n\n\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Jensen Meat ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance.\n\nThe facility including the ammonia systems was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in the cold rooms and vent line.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to an ammonia diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Jensen Meat has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration systems as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility\u0092s accident history condu"

However, the facility did have minor ammonia leaks. Spiral Freezer 1 (SP1) had a small ammonia leak below 100 lbs. Additionally, the -60 \u00b0F filter had a small ammonia leak. Refer to the facility Incident Investigation forms for more details on these occurrences.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Jensen Meat facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations.\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's action plan to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation for System 1, 2 and 4 conducted on October 15 and 17, 2024 and the Process Hazard Analysis conducted on October 14, 2021 (System"

The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Jensen Meat safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.
