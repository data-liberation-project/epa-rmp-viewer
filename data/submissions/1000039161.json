We use a system of safety devices, rigorous training, strict procedures, and integrated emergency response to prevent releases and reduce the impact of releases that might occur. Safety controls include hydrocarbon sensors, excess flow valves, interlocked ventilation, redundant safeties on critical functions, and alarms that automatically stop the process. The following safety measures are in place: Regular equipment inspection, preventative maintenance program, elements of PSM, systematic training of all employees on job functions, safe operation, process controls, emergency actions, written procedures and standards based on risk assessment, root cause investigation of incidents, and regular audits of procedures, equipment, and systems by both Sealed Air and outside agencies.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe Sealed Air Plant at Louisville has implemented an accidental Release Prevention Policy which integrates hydrocarbon sensors, redundant safety systems, alarm systems, stringent inspection, testing and calibration procedures, operational procedures, and management practices. All applicable EPA, OSHA, Kentucky and Louisville environmental health and safety regulations are adhered to. The Sealed Air, Louisville Emergency Response Policy involves site specific plans which are detailed in the Emergency Response Plan. This includes trained on site emergency responders for all operational hours and automatic systems that will stop the process and notify the local fire department.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe Louisville Plant manufactures plastic foam packaging, and uses Butane as a blowing agent to make the plastic foam. This is the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location. Butane is a flammable hydrocarbon stored and used in liquid form by keeping the material under pressure, but is released as a gas during the manufacturing process. This gas is collected and sent to an oxidizer in order to control emissions.\n\n\n\n3. Worst and Alternate Case Scenarios:\n\nThe \"Worst-case Release\" scenario is defined by EPA in the OCA as failure of the largest tank when full, and the vapors find an ignition source and 10% of the release explodes. The endpoint for a 1 psi overpressure is .43 miles. The plant is located in an industrial park with minimal residential receptors close by.\n\n\n\nThe \"Alternative Release\" scenario or more credible scenario is based upon catastrophic failure of the 2in delivery piping and a 30 second release before the excess flow valve fully seals off the fl"

Five Year Accident History: \n\nNone.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:\n\nAll employees are trained on Emergency Action Plan including alarm response and building evacuation. There is a trained emergency Response Team for minor leak repairs and incipient fire fighting. Fire alarm will automatically summon the local fire department, shut down the process, and shut off the gas supply. Pre-planning will be conducted with the local fire department. Emergency operation and response will be reviewed on an annual basis.\n\n \n\n"
