Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nEmergency Response\nDorada Foods has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes aspects of emergency response such as evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The Rockingham County LEPC is the agency with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner."

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n- Compliance Audits\nDorada Foods conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n- Incident Investigation\nDorada Foods promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n- Employee Participation\nDorada Foods truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility\u2019s compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n- Contractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our in-house First Responders are trained to take defensive action in correcting, minimizing and mitigating emergency situations. For emergency situations, we are also coordinated with the Rockingham County LEPC which provides emergency response expertise.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u2019s primary activities revolve poultry further processing. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA \u201cRMP*COMP\u201d as well as the EPA \u201cRisk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\u201d.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
