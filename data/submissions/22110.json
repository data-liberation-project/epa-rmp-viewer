It is the policy of Archbold Agri-Services to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Management and employees are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, county LEPC, EPA, and all other authorities to minimize a release and its impact on people and the environment.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substance handled: The primary activity at the Kunkle facility is the receiving and storage of anhydrous ammonia for our retail facility in Archbold. Anhydrous ammonia is received by rail, stored. filled into nurse tanks, and brought into the Archbold facility to be sold to the farmer for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored is 84,118 pounds in an 18,O00 gal storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  The worst- case scenario is the release of the total contents of a tank rail car released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 17000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.21 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario:  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a transfer hose failure (1.5\"hose).  Based on The Fertilizer Institute Alternate-Case Releases of Anhydrous Ammonia Table 1. assuming, that the release is stopped by active/passive mitig"

All employees are trained in the equipment safety features and the safe\nhandling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe five-year accident history: There have been no accidental release of anhydrous\nammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant\nproperty damage at the facility. Neither have there been a release that, to our knowledge,\nresulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or\nenvironmental damage.\n\nThe emergency response program: The facility has a written Emergency Response Plan\nin accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training. A copy of the Emergency Response Plan has been given to the local fire department, and to the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nThe facility submits annual community right-to-know information as required under\nSARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: Safety improvements are an on-going process at this\nfacility. Periodic evaluations are performed by company personnel and by the Ohio Department of Agriculture to assure the safety of equipment and procedures. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
