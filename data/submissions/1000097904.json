Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs.  Enable's mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes, just to name a few.  Enable's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan Procedure in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE BRADLEY NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe Bradley Natural Gas Processing Plant, located at 4065 County Road 2970, Bradley, OK, 73011 in Grady County, operates two cryogenic expander plants with propane refrigeration to extract natural gas liquids from raw field natural gas, as well as a condensate stabilizer to process raw high vapor pressure condensate into a NFPA 3 liquid product.  \n\n\n\nPlant products include: \n\n-Pipeline quality natural gas (primarily methane)\n\n-Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), composed primarily of ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbons, also known as Y-grade.\n\n-Stabilized Condensate, composed primarily of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons (NFPA 3 liquid)\n\n\n\nThe Bradley Plant holds the following regulated flammable substances in excess of the threshold quantities:\n\n-Natural Gas (Inlet)\n\n-Natural Gas (Residue)\n\n-NGL\n\n-Propane\n\n-Condensate (Raw)\n\n-Condensate (Stabilized)\n\n    \n\nIn order to"

It is noteworthy that the Bradley Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n    \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n    \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) was determined to be a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the release of the full inventory of either PV 304 Plant 1 NGL Surge Tank or PV 2304 Plant 2 NGL Surge Tank containing NGL.  For the Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory capacity (100% maximum tank capacity) of this tank were assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance the 1 psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.6 miles.  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating or calculating the WCS.\n\n    \n\nAlternative Case Scenario\n\n\n\nIn determining the ACS, the following scenarios were considered:\n\n-Transfer hose releases due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling;\n\n-Process piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains or bleeds;\n\n-Process vessel or pump releases due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure;\n\n-Vessel overfilling and spill, or overpressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks; and\n\n-Shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill.\n\n\n\nBased on the five-year accident history and the process hazard analysis, as well as considering scenarios that are more likely to occur than the WCS, the following ACSs were selected for each chemical held above the threshold quantity:\n\n\n\n-NGL - P 302 / 2302 (A/B/C) NGL Pipeline Pump Seal/Packing Failure - 114,889 lbs\n\nVCE resulting from a release"

The scenario assumes complete failure of seal/packing resulting in full pump flow released to the atmosphere at 449 gpm or 1915 lb/min. The release is assumed to be sustained for 60 minutes prior to being isolated, ignoring administrative and active controls in place, to provide the most conservatively estimated scenario.

The HAZOP analysis methodology is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enable Midstream personnel and/or Contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This PHA Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n    \n\nThe PHA Team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions.  Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks-as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management.  This risk reduction ranking helps to ensure that potential accident scenarios, especially those assigned to the highest hazard risk, receive immediate attention.  All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until assigned action items/tasks are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, dated, and retained.\n\n    \n\nPeriodically, the Bradley plant updates and revalidates the initial process hazard analysis (PHA) to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and within acceptable company risk tolerances.  The PHA Revalidation verifies that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features.
