The following plan is how Mid-West Fertilizer, Inc. - Independence plans to prevent accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n1.The facility policy for accidental release prevention:                                                                    \n\na.This facility handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA.
