Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmer Union Oil Co-op Assn. in Centerville are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Centerville Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have propane \nstored in 11,500- and 10,500-gallon interconnected tanks located at our facility in Centerville (Figure\n1).  The maximum amount stored is 18,700 gallons (78,970 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity\nof 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected propane storage tank (78,970 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an lower\nflammability level of 35 mg/L at a"

This\namount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can result in serious injury to\npeople within this distance.  The estimated population within a 0.35-mile radius of this facility is\n600.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  Under neutral weather\nconditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint with a lower flammability limit of 35 mg/L at a\nrelease rate of 5,000 pounds per minute is less than 0.06 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population\nwithin a 0.06-mile radius of this facility is 150.\n\n\n\n     4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nFarmer Union Oil Co-op Assn. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFarmer Union Oil Co-op Assn. maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities\nwithin our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in\nthe processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nFarmer Union Oil Co-op Assn. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are"

Maintenance checks are performed by qualified personnel with previous\ntraining in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Farmer Union Oil Co-op Assn. to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nFarmer Union Oil Co-op Assn. routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new\nprocesses and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nFarmer Union Oil Co-op Assn. conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether\nthe provisions of the plan, as set out under 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nFarmer Union Oil Co-op Assn. truly believes that process safety management and accident\nprevention is a team effort.
