      "SummaryText": "The Donald M. Reed Filter Plant of the Warrior River Water Authority is the supplier of potable water for approximately 5,000 customers. We have been in the business of clean water since 1968. Our employees are people of the highest caliber, who sincerely care about what they are doing and have been trained and certified by the State of Alabama in water purification. One of the chemicals necessary to the water treatment process is chlorine. Chlorine is a hazardous gas, and one we treat with much respect. We have  safety classes throughout the year, and a detailed emergency response plan that has been coordinated with our local Fire Department as well as the Jefferson County LEPC and EMA. The response plan includes the transportation route of the trucks delivering the chlorine, and a drawing of the filter plant as well as where the chlorine is stored. We have included a telephone list and notification procedure. We have Incident Notification Forms, HazMat Forms, and Chemical Inventory Forms. We have an evacuation facility plan, and a vulnerable zone map with traffic control points marked for possible road blocks. We have never had an accidental chlorine release, but we have identified a vulnerable zone of 0.9 miles. We have 9 residences inside the vulnerable zone, and 1 at risk facility (Donaldson Correctional Facility). We have listed our emergency resources and equipment."
