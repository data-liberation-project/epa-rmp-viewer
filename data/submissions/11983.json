In case of any conflict in interpretation of the policy, contact your supervisor.\n\n\n\n\tThe City of Union's Water Treatment Plant is located at the corner of Calhoun Street and Arthur Boulevard within the city limits of Union.  This facility treats raw water from the Broad River to supply potable water for the City of Union and a large surrounding area.  The plant operates under  SCDHEC System ID #4410001.  Treatment processes include physical/chemical steps for solids settling and filtration, and chlorination for disinfection.\n\n\tFacilities in place to accomplish chlorination include pumping and chlorinator equipment to introduce a chlorine solution into the water stream.  Chlorine for this process is stored and handled on-site in ton cylinders.  Normal operations include two cylinders on-line, with one spare in reserve.  The on-line cylinders have individual vacuum regulators, and are manifolded on the vacuum side with automatic switchover to the chlorination equipment.\n\n\tChlorine is the only regulated substance maintained on-site in quantities above the regulated threshold limit.\n\n\tThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the Owner or Operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\n\tThe worst-case release scenario involves a failure of two ton-cylinders which are manifolded together, resulting in a release of 4000 lb of chlorine in a 10-minute period.

Assuming a hole with a diameter of one inch (conservative), the chlorine release rate is approximately 150 pounds per minute.  Utilizing EPA's pre-defined conditions (wind speed 3 m/s, atmospheric stability Class D), the maximum toxic endpoint occurs at 0.2 miles from the release point, potentially affecting 160 people.\n\n\tThe facility is equipped with chlorine detection equipment, which is an active mitigation measure.\n\n\tBoth scenarios are based on prescribed assumptions.  In an actual release event, the plume of gas would be more elliptical than circular and extend downwind and/or downgradient, likely affecting a smaller area and population than the models predict.\n\n\tThe general accidental release prevention program is a multi-faceted effort configured to comply with both EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM rules.  Key elements include a high level of employee training, an aggressive equipment maintenance routine, detailed operation procedures, hazard reviews and management controls.\n\n\tChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detection equipment.\n\n\tNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\tThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the City of Union Fire Depa"
