      "SummaryText": "Athens-Clarke County Public Utilities Department Risk Management Plan for chlorine handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chorine releases.   All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe Middle Oconee Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater before discharge to the Middle Oconee River. The chlorination process includes chlorine storage cylinders, chlorination equipment, monitoring instrumentation, and a vacuum flow regulating system. \n \nAccidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine release.  The first \"worst case scenario, defined by EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the... maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" interaction.  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"  In each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to a theoretical \"toxic endpoint\".  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario for the Middle Oconee WPCF involves a failure of (1) one-ton cylinder yielding a cumulative release of 2,000 lb. of chlorine"

      "SummaryText": ".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling for this scenario was performed using the EPA's RMP Comp.  The distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.9 miles.\n  \nThe alternative release scenario involves the mechanical failure of one flexible manifold connection allowing an accidental release from a one ton cylinder of chlorine over a period of 15 minutes.  The distance to endpoint was determined to be 0.1 miles under normal atmospheric conditions.  \n\nThe Middle Oconee WPCF has operated safely since its construction.  A process history review indicates that no reportable accidental releases have occurred within the past five years.\n\nThe Athens-Clarke County Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of a potential chorine release including operator training, a preventive maintenance program, process specific safety equipment and monitors, plus safe and effective standard operating procedures.  Furthermore, Athens-Clarke County Public Utilities has an environmental, health and safety program with the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process including a respiratory protection (SCBA), chemical right to know, hazard review of equipment and procedures, periodic auditing and inspection, and comprehensive management.\n\nIn May of 2000, the Middle Oconee WPCF will begin using sulfur dioxide as a dechlorination agent.  This update includes predictive filing for this compound.  Sulfur dioxide is a gas which is handled in the same manner as chlorine.  The material is shipped and stored in one ton cylinders under pressure.  Distribution systems are the same as for chlorine, with minor changes for componet materials.  \n\nWith the installation of the sulfur dioxide system, the chlorine and future sulfur dioxide buildings will be completely enclosed.  A chemical scrubber system will be installed to destroy any product that may be released.  New sensors able to detect both chemicals wil"
