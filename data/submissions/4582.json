      "SummaryText": "\nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction \nMany chemicals, although considered hazardous, provide very beneficial uses to industry and to the individual; usage of these chemicals is commonplace.  They are transported on roads, waterways, and railways and stored in substantial quantities at their point of use.  The City of Allentown's Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) uses chlorine, a strong bactericidal agent, to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharge to the Lehigh River, which protects the river's downstream uses and public health.  Allentown has a firm commitment to the safety obligations and responsibilities associated with storing and using chlorine.  The seriousness and effectiveness of Allentown's commitment has been demonstrated in both its unblemished safety record and stellar environmental compliance record.  As required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program, the following document describes the steps Allentown takes routinely to ensure the safety within the treatment plant, what could happen if there were an accident, and what procedures would be followed in the event of an emergency. \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe City of Allentown's (COA) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training recommendations, systems management approaches, and emergency response procedures.  The central focus of Allentown's response policy has always been and will continue to be proactive prevention.  The absence of any emergency due to a chlorine leak evidences the success of this approach.\nThis document summarizes Allentown's existing health and safety programs, the internal management response team approa"

The WWTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan (ERP) to handle any potential accidental releases; the ERP is designed to safeguard both individuals on-site and off-site.\nAs a result of the detailed development of the areas noted, this document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. \nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\nThe WWTP, operating since 1928, is located at 112 Union Street in the City of Allentown.  Wastewater treated at the WWTP is disinfected with chlorine prior to discharge to the Lehigh River.  The treated wastewater meets all permitted standards. The facility is designated as primary advanced secondary treatment.  The wastewater treatment process train includes preliminary screening, grit removal, comminution, primary settling, 2-stage biological treatment, intermediate settling, final settling, and chlorination before final discharge.  The WWTP is permitted to treat 40 million gallons per day (MGD) with a current average flow of 30-32 MGD. The facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP.  The Plant's chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in the RMP Regulations.\nLiquid chlorine is brought to the plant via delivery trucks that drop off the ton containers at the chlorine loading/unloading area. The containers are unloaded with a specifically designed lifting hoist.  The ton containers are stored in a dedicated storage room adjacent to similarly dedicated areas housing chlorine delivery systems. Chlorine leak detectors continuously mo"

These alarms are annunciated at the local control panels; and more importantly, at the main operators' control station. In the case of a leak, the storage area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.  In addition, evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing valves are designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is detected; thus preventing liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system. The chlorination system also includes factory-set pressure relief valves to protect the integrity of the equipment should pressure rise.\nThere is a sodium hydroxide based scrubbing system on-site designed to neutralize any accidental releases of chlorine.  However, as will be noted later in the RMP evaluation process, this system is not included in analysis based on the potential for simultaneous loss of electrical power.\nFor the protection and safety of operational personnel, emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at entrances to the chlorine building.  The chlorine building has Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) mounted externally so they are accessible in an emergency.  The facility also includes other design features such as vision panels and panic bar doors.\nThe chlorine building is equipped with a normal ventilation system that is controlled by operators at a switch at each entrance. Operational SOPs require initiation prior to entry. When the chlorine leak detector detects 2 ppm of chlorine in the room, the ventilator shuts down and a supplemental ventilation system activates, which removes air from the floor level (chlorine is heavier than air) and delivers it to the scrubber.\nEntrance to the WWTP is controlled at the driveway off of Union Street by a gate that is only open during normal working hours.  During those hours, visitors and contractors mu"

The plant is manned 24-hours a day, year round, and there is a centralized alarm system which notifies staff of any problems or situations that indicate an atypical situation that might require follow-up investigations.      \nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The worst case scenario assumes that the entire content of the largest single container of chlorine is released, regardless of how improbable that may be.  In addition, only \"passive\" mitigation methods, such as buildings or dikes (for liquids) can be considered.  Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. The regulations require that the worst case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas.\n \nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine is focused on the ton containers that store chlorine liquid. The scenario used for the WWTP is the rupture of one chlorine container with a maximum capacity of 2000 lbs, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration. The release rate for this scenario is 200 pounds per minute (lbs/min).    \nThe cylinder rupture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact.\nThe alternative release reflects a type of release that is more likely to occur. Unlike the worst case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation, such as automatic shutoff valves and scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.  Lastly, the alternative release scenario assumes more"

The scenario presenting the most hazardous situation was a failure of a fusible plug on a ton container. Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 56.94 lbs/min. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the worst alternative release scenario indicate that this scenario has a slight offsite impact. \n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazards to any individuals at on-site or off-site locations (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the WWTP during the last five years. \nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \nCity of Allentown WWTP is in compliance with Federal Risk Management Planning (RMP) requirements.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\nCity of Allentown WWTP's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n* Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n* Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders,  and contractors\n* Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n* Completion of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n* Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n* Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with operations and maintenance staff participation\n* High level of training of operators and mainte"

This information includes chlorine background information, material safety data sheets (MSDS), and chlorine reaction chemistry.\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process.  Specifications for the process are collected in one place for easy reference.  Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\nWe also have procedures in place that is triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\nHazard Analysis \nIn 1999, a detailed hazard analysis (HA) was conducted with plant staff, engineering, and administrative staff for the regulated process.  The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers.  The HA technique used was process checklist procedure, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The HA was lead by knowledgeable persons on the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a five-year period, or whenever there is major change in the process.
