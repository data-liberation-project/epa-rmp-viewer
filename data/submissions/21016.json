It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Mason City Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the North Central regional Emergency Planning District will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Emery (Mason City), Iowa location is Ken Campbell, agronomy  manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n                      Ken Campbell, agronomy manager\n                               WORK:    (515) 423-6963 \n                               24-Hour:  (515) 756-3862\n                               Home:      (515) 749-2402\n\n                      Rick Demaray,  Dougherty location manager\n                         "

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of two (2)  30,000-gallon storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is two (2).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE  RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Cities of Mason City and Clear Lake and the unincorporated communities of Em"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1995 and State law. \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Rockwell AG Center has extended to the Mason City Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nRockwell AG Center, Emery (Mason City), Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Rockwell AG Center  to immediately notify the Mason City Fire Department and the North Central Regional Emergency Planning District to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Mason City Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Emery location, the  Fire Department with whom Mason City has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and North Central regional Emergency Planning District. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED C"
