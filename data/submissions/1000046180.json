Searles Valley Minerals extracts, chemically processes and ships minerals and inorganic chemical compounds to customers all over the world.  The company currently produces soda ash, sodium borates, boric acid and natural sulfate.  \n\n\n\nDescription of Regulated Substance Use\n\nSearles Valley Minerals' Westend Facility produces borax and sodium sulfate by processing Brines obtained from Searles Lake.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used (in the manufacturing of borax and sodium sulfate) as a refrigerant (for cooling) in a closed loop system.  The cooling process (i.e., the use of anhydrous ammonia) is a 24-hour per day, 365-day per year operation that is essential to manufacturing operations conducted at the Westend Facility.\n\n\n\nThere are four distinct uses of anhydrous ammonia at the Westend Facility:\n\n1.    To cool the gas-turbine generator inlet air (thus increasing the generator's capacity and efficiency);\n\n2.    To chill brine in the borax manufacturing process (thus removing the heat of crystallization);\n\n3.    To chill brine in the sulfate crystallization process; and\n\n4.    To reduce NOx emissions in a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage, handling and use system at the Westend Facility consists of the following major components:\n\n?    The main high pressure receiver;\n\n?    Two liquid recirculating units (LRUs);\n\n?    Seven ammonia compressors;\n\n?    Six evaporative condensers (i.e., cooling towers);\n\n?    The SCR unit and injectors, etc.;\n\n?    Transfer piping and supports; and\n\n?    Process instrumentation, detection and monitoring devices.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage, handling and use system at the Westend Facility consists of an assortment of process vessels, heat exchangers and compressors connected via an extensive network of piping in a closed loop system.  Anhydrous ammonia is kept under high pressure"

The HPR supplies two Liquid Recirculating Units (LRUs 3 and 4) each of which is dedicated to a specific process at the Westend Facility.  The LRUs in turn supply liquid ammonia to their process where the pressure of liquid ammonia is reduced through expansion valves.  This pressure reduction results in a transformation of liquid ammonia to vapor phase and results in cooling.  As the ammonia vapor moves through the process, unwanted heat is transferred from the process to the ammonia vapor indirectly (the desired end result).  This indirect heat transfer results in a warming of the ammonia vapor (thus losing its cooling value).  The ammonia vapor is therefore compressed, cooled indirectly (in condensers/cooling towers), liquefied and returned to the main High Pressure Receiver (making it available again).  LRU No. 3 is dedicated to the Sulfate Crystallization Process while LRU No. 4 is dedicated to the Borax Manufacturing Process.\n\n\n\nSite Security\n\nA chain link fence surrounds the Westend Facility.  Additionally, the Facility is protected via manned 24-hour security.  These site security provisions are intended to prevent unauthorized access to Facility areas including those areas where anhydrous ammonia is stored, handled or used, thus adding a level of safety for the storage of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility.\n\n\n\nES 2.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe Federal RMP regulations and the CalARP RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n\n\n?    the worst case release; and\n\n?    an alternative release (an accident scenario that is more credible than the worst-case release scenario).\n\n\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative rele"

Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed below.\n\n\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nIn this scenario, the main Anhydrous Ammonia High Pressure Receiver on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the area where the receiver located).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.  However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded.  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 85,190-pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be released (administrative controls limit the vessel's capacity to 85-percent full).  The release of ammonia would occur outdoors.  Thus, it was assumed that the ammonia released during the catastrophic accident forms a cloud of ammonia vapor which is free to migrate off-site.  No liquid pooling was considered to occur during the release (this assumption is conservative in nature and results in the largest estimated vulnerable zone).  Utilizing the BREEZE DEGADIS PLUS MODEL, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 2.4-miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios which are considered to be more likely to occur are those which may result in the release of anywhere from less than one-pound to up to 43,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  These scenarios include situations such as accidental releases during anhydrous ammonia delivery to- or loading of- the main high pressure receiver at the facility, pinhole leaks in either the high pressure or low pressure anhydrous ammonia transfer piping (which contain anhydrous ammonia in either liquid or vapor phase), a partial or complete failure of the anhydrous ammonia tr"

In order to be conservative in the estimation of the vulnerable zone, it was assumed that 43,000-pounds of anhydrous ammonia (in liquid phase) is released due to a failure of a three-inch anhydrous ammonia liquid transfer line connected to Liquid Recirculating Unit No. 3 (the vessel does not have an automatic shutoff valve.  The failure was assumed to occur within four feet of the connection to the Unit.  The resulting cloud of ammonia vapor was assumed to freely migrate off-site.  Utilizing the USEPA's RMP*COMP Software Program, the estimated vulnerable zone for this hypothetical accidental release scenario is approximately 1.6-miles.\n\n\n\nES 3.0    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of the Year 2019 Five Year Federal RMP/CalARP RMP Update (i.e., from July 8, 2014 through July 8, 2019), the Facility has NOT had any releases of anhydrous ammonia that have resulted in:\n\n?

Details of each of these components of the Facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program are provided in the document entitled Federal Risk Management Plan (Federal RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program Risk Management Plan (CalARP RMP), OSHA Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM) Program, Volume I - Prevention Program.  \n\n\n\nThere are a number of detection and monitoring devices and alarms designed to ensure the continued safe operation of the Westend Facility's Processes (i.e., which encompasses the storage, handling and use of anhydrous ammonia).  These devices are located throughout the Process Areas and monitor various aspects of Operations.  \n\n\n\nES 5.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nSearles Valley Minerals recognizes that emergency preparedness, emergency planning and emergency response are an integral component of risk management.   As such, two extensive and detailed emergency response plans have been developed and implemented at the Westend Facility.  These Plans include ALL aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation and notification of LERC/LEPD and the Public.\n\n\n\nALL emergency response equipment is frequently tested, inspected and serviced to ensure proper functioning.  The emergency evacuation sirens are tested every Friday at noon.  In addition, the emergency response plans are reviewed periodically and updated (as needed) to reflect pertinent changes in processes, operations and/or personnel that may require a modified emergency response.  Emergency response drills and exercises are conducted periodically to ensure rapid response and effectiveness of the emergency response team.  ALL"
