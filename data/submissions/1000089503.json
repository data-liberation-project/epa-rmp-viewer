The Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Perryton Equity Exchange - PringleMorse location are committed\n\nto the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should\n\noccur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate\n\nany release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n? The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for\n\ncrop production nutrients.\n\n? The maximum quantity stored would be 89,500 pounds in our one 18,500 gallon tank.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or\n\ntank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 89,500\n\npounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design\n\nstandards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely\n\npotential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of\n\ndispersion to 200 ppm) is 2 miles.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and\n\nthe standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n\n\"Storage and handling of "

Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n? To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property\n\ndamage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n\ninformation as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120,\n\nincluding pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess\n\nthe maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\n\nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
