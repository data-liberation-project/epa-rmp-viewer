The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Methanex USA, LLC - Geismar Site (the facility) is located at 4171 Highway 73; Geismar, Ascension Parish, Louisiana 70734-3533.  The G1 and G2 units produce methanol from natural gas by reforming the gas with steam and then converting and distilling the resulting synthesized gas mixture to produce pure methanol.  The G3 unit produces methanol using an autothermal reformer to produce synthesis gas from natural gas feed and mixes this gas with purge gas from the G1 and G2 units and oxygen from a supplier.  The facility contains the following RMP-regulated substances: methane, hydrogen and ammonia.  The final product, pure methanol, is stored in dedicated tanks before being transferred to loading facilities.\n\nThe facility's risk management program and maximum chemical inventory were evaluated and it was determined that the facility's processes render the facility subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements. The facility has three (3) RMP covered processes.  Geismar 1 and Geismar 2, each contain approximately 13,000 pounds of an NFPA-4 flammable mixture, G3 contains approximately 80,000 pounds of an NFPA-4 flammable mixture.  Additionally,  the G1 and G2 process contains approximately 240,000  pounds of a 29.4 percent ammonia solution which is used for purposes of flue gas NOx reduction by means of selective catalytic reduction.  The G3 process contains approximately 65,000  pounds of a 29.4 percent ammonia solution which is used for purposes of flue gas NOx reduction by means of selective catalytic reduction. Moreover, the processes render the facility subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As such, given that the facility has to comply with OSHA PSM standards and the fact that RMP offsite consequence analysis worst-case modeling yields the potential for offsite impacts, the facility is subject to RMP Prevention Progra"
