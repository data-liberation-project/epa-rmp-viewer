If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\nThe primary activity at Chemtec, is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers. Aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as fertilizers for crop production nutrients. Aqua ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in one above ground tank at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 5300 pounds. We do not store aqua ammonia on a year round basis. All sales go directly to growers location. Chemtec has on going training for employees handling aqua ammonia and proper emergency response in case of an emergency. Chemtec Inc., prides itself on a complete and upto date safety and health programs that management is commited to.  Aqua ammonia worst-case scenario is faliure of the storage tank holding 5300 pounds of material. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .28 miles. The alternative release scenario (based on the most likely potential incident) is a release of an amount equal to or less than 5300 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .06 miles.  There have been no accidental releases or near misses of aqua ammonia, in the past five years and longer.  We have a written response program that provides for communication with local emergency responders and employees have onsite emergency training.
