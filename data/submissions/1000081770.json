The facility has retained the original manufacturer OEM manuals, equipment drawings, etc. for reference purposes and aid in maintenance activities.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nProvide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.

The facility utilizes outside contractors to perform routine and emergency maintenance on the system.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThese procedures require that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The main categories reviewed are the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review\r\nFollowing completion of a change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.  This confirms that the following program elements have been updated, revised, or carried out: process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audit\r\nThis audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements has been implemented and properly documented by California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant personnel.

The facility investigates releases and near misses that could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Recommendations are addressed and corrected by facility management.  Reports are kept for at least five years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nEmployee involvement is critical to the success of the prevention program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the prevention programs (e.g., process hazard analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operator's day-to-day activities.  \r\n\r\nSecond, all California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant employees (direct hires and contract) receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. \r\n\r\nHot Work \r\nIf welding, grinding, or other hot work occurs, a Hot Work permit is required.

The facilities emergency action plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \r\n\r\nThe facility shall coordinate with outside parties through drills. Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency.  In addition, Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\r\n\r\nDetailed plans have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  Under the best circumstances, all areas (zones) inside the building should be brought under control within 20 minutes of an ammonia release or breakdown, if personnel are on site.  Small releases should be brought under control immediately.  \r\n\r\nThe plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and switches for the system.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches are identified.  \r\n\r\nFacility hazardous material personnel do not enter an IDLH condition which is currently 300 ppm for ammonia. Responders are trained to the air purifying respirator level and trained to retreat at the IDLH level.  Facility hazmat team personnel will assist outside agencies during larger releases merely for facility or c"

All personnel not trained to respond will evacuate to the meeting areas and be accounted for.\r\n\r\nA-7\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns.  The prevention program has been updated as part of the 5-year program update and re-submittal process.  Several PHA studies were conducted at California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant and the study team made recommendations for additional safety.\r\n\r\nRefer to the most recent process hazard analysis for the scheduled list of improvements to reduce accidental releases either in process or planned for at this time."
