Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. The N. Reeves ROTF has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances are held regularly. Employees are encourages and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through Western Midstream's Near Miss and Observation programs."

These procedures along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87] \nThe N. Reeves ROTF uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near covered process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n(1) perform their work in a safe manner;\n(2) have the appropriate knowledge;\n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace;\n(4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency;\n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and;\n(6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work;\n(7) know and understand the Stop Work policy at the facility.\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n(1) a process overview of the facility;\n(2) information about safety and health hazards;\n(3) emergency response plan requirements, and;\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\n\nIn addition, contractor safety programs and performance will be evaluated during selection of contractors. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe N.

The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each findings is documented and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nThe N. Reeves ROTF investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

Reeves ROTF has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\n\nChanges are reviewed to:\n(1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nThe N.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction has been completed in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

      "SummaryText": "erence documents are maintained on file at the facility. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nThe N. Reeves ROTF has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the covered process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The N. Reeves ROTF primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards associated with the process as well as accident prevention and mitigati"

      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\nN. Reeves ROTF is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe N. Reeves ROTF is a centralized oil treatment facility. Oil enters the site via a production pipeline, and is heated by line heaters before going through the inlet surge vessel. Compressed gas is then separated from Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) in the compressor scrubber. NGLS are stored under pressure until sent via pipeline to a gas processing facility for further fractionation. Liquids from the inlet surge vessel are sent to the 3-phase separator. From the 3-phase separator, the gas stream is sent to the overhead compressor header. The oil stream, from the 3-phase separator, is sent to stabilizer towers. Stabilized oil then leaves the facility via pipeline.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the covered process at the facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nThe N. Reeves ROTF keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The ref"
