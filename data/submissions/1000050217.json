This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  PSEG Fossil's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe PSEG Fossil - Hudson Generating Station is located in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey.  Hudson Generating Station is installing an environmental control system, which will have one regulated toxic substance, aqueous ammonia.  The concentration of ammonia within the solution will be between 27% and 29.8% by weight.  The aqueous ammonia will be utilized as an integral component of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on Unit No. 2 to reduce Nitrogen Oxide (Nox) emissions.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nPSEG Fossil has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years at Hudson Generating Station.  Since the aqueous ammonia system installation the facility did not have any reportable accident at the facility within the last five years.  Should an accident occur, it would be investigated to determine ways to prevent similar incident from recurring.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nPSEG Fossil maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes.  The overall emergency response program for Hudson Generating Station is coordinate"

      "SummaryText": "d with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nHudson Generating Station have written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures will be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures will be periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEHS OPERATOR TRAINING\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, PSEG Fossil implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the aqueous ammonia system.  All of the training will be documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nSAFETY\r\nPSEG Fossil strives for continuous improvement in its safety programs.  Including training employees to safely perform assigned tasks and encouraging employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help improve safety and performance.  Preventative maintenance is performed to minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\nPSEG Fossil has a contractor management program that will require contractors to perform their tasks safely and to understand the safe work practices that must be followed. Contractors will receive an orientation covering our Emergency Response Plan, an overview of the processes in the facility, and various facility procedures. Their entrance, presence, and exit from the facility will be controlled. All work performed by outside contractors will be reviewed by PSEG Fossil personnel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL EMERGENCY CONTACT:\r\n\r\nSenior Operating Supervisor \r\nFrank Vopasek \t\t        Desk: 201-217-3624\t Cell: 201-403-4816\r\nKeith Davis \t\t\tDesk: 201-217-3624\t Cell: 570-394-3898\r\nDoug Stroud"
