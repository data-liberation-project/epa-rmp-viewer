      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nHOLLYWOOD ROAD WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nGeneral Facility Information\nThe Hollywood Road Wastewater Treatment Plant, located approximately six miles southeast of downtown Amarillo in Randall County, is a City of Amarillo facility which treats up to 12 million gallons per day (mgd) of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater.  Presently on average, the wastewater treatment plant facility processes seven and one half million gallons per day.  The plant utilizes an activated sludge sewage treatment process and operates 24 hours per day, year round.  There are 22 employees onsite at various times during normal business hours.  At night and during irregular work hours, two employees are always on duty at the facility.  A maximum of 18 tons of chlorine gas (Cl2) in one ton containers is stored onsite with six containers being connected and online at any one time.  The plant also has a maximum of ten tons of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in one ton containers stored onsite with two containers being connected and online at any one time.\n\nOngoing safety training programs cover all phases of plant operation from maintenance and operations safety to safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The Hollywood Road facility also conducts formal training as well as onsite training during normal daily operations.  Due to this safety training, this plant has not had any significant releases or accidents in the last five years.\n\nHazard Assessment Information\n40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B - Hazard Assessment, outlines a specific set of criteria required to be used in the modeling of worst case and most probable case release scenarios.  Worst case and most probable case scenario modeling was completed using Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) software. \n\nTo complete most probable case and worst case scenario plume models, the default level of concern for chlorine and sulfur dioxide was set at levels established in EPA and American Industrial Hygiene Association g"

      "SummaryText": "uidance.  The resulting plume indicates a level where individuals would be able to take protective actions without suffering any serious health effects from a chemical exposure during a one hour or less period.  Most probable case and worst case scenario plume analysis results are conservative estimates based on the ALOHA software, using RMP release and meteorological requirements. \n\nPrevention Program Information\nThe Hollywood Road Wastewater Treatment Plant processes seven and one half million gallons per day of domestic sewage.  The plant has an on-going training plan that involves both written training and hands on training.  All new employees that will be handling chlorine or sulfur dioxide are trained the first day on the job when they have their Right-to-Know training.  Any small controlled leaks will be handled by plant personnel and all others will be handled by the fire department.  The plant has not had an incident in the history of the treatment plant. \n\nEmergency Response Information\nA controlled release of the chlorine or sulfur dioxide product located at the wastewater treatment plant site shall be defined as the escape of gas to the atmosphere in small, non-reportable quantities, resulting from standard operating procedures to connect or disconnect chlorine containers and standard maintenance procedures on the plant's chlorine and sulfur dioxide delivery systems. \n\nAn uncontrolled release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide which will require the implementation of emergency response procedures is defined as any release other than those examples defined as similar to controlled releases.  Emergency responses to the treatment plant will be made by the Amarillo Fire Department, in accordance with the community emergency response plan.  If uncontrolled release conditions warrant such actions, shelter-in-place, evacuation and public warning will be implemented by the Amarillo/Potter/Randall Department of Emergency Management.  Any uncontrolled release of chlori"
