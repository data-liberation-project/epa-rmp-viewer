The Facility Policy\nThe owners, members, and employees of Dorman Brothers, L.L.C. are committed to the prevention of accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other agencies to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enivornment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\nThis facility was put into operation on October 1, 2002 and the most current safety measures where implemented at that time.  The primary acticity at this facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.  The maximum quantity stored would be 157,590 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in one fixed-site storage tank.  The ammonia is delivered in by truck.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Althernate Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum released would be 131,325 pounds, which represents  85% of the capacity of the tank as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles.\nThe alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release of 100 lbs. from an overfill.  The distance to endpoint is .2 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThis facility has jmplemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61-1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adiminstration, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five Year A"
