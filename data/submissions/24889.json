EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef Packing Company, L.P (Farmland National Beef) owns and operates a beef slaughter house and packing plant in Dodge City, Kansas.  On site, Farmland National Beef has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration of meat at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.130.\n\n\n\nBecause the quantity of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, Farmland National Beef is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Dodge City, Kansas plant which includes three (3) major elements: hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMP Plan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Farmland National Beef.  In the first-time submission of the RMP information on June 23, 1999, Farmland National Beef inadvertently completed the RMP report as a program level 1 submittal.  In fact, Farmland National Beef had in place all components necessary for a program level 3 RMP.  This RMP report is being submitted to correct the inadvertent error and to properly submit a program level 3 RMP report.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef is committed to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in our routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.  To implement this policy, the following plans are maintained and implemented at the Dodge City facility:\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) Program\n\nRisk Manageme"

      "SummaryText": "nt Program\n\n\n\nThese programs and procedures provide comprehensive planning for accidental and emergency situations. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Description of Farmland National Beef and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Farmland National Beef, L.P. Dodge City, Kansas plant located at 2000 East Trail Street is a beef slaughter house and packing facility.  Live cattle are received and slaughtered, and fresh meat is cut and packaged.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary refrigeration of the meat.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the plant itself.  There are approximately 150,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n\n\n1.3 Worst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nSection 68.3 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case release as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The worst-case release scenario analysis required under Section 68.25 evaluates this release under worst-case conditions.\n\n\n\nAt Farmland National Beef, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of anhydrous ammonia from the largest vessel, and the equipment located in the vicinity of the largest vessel, containing anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia receiver is the largest ammonia vessel at the facility.  In the worst-case release scenario, the receiver, and the equipment located in the vicinity of the receiver, contain approximately 75,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The equipment is assumed to instantaneously release its entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The anhydrous ammonia will then volatilize into the atmosphere.  Modeling of this release was performed using Trinity Consultants' BREEZE HAZ DEGADIS+ Version 1.0 (DEGADIS).  The distance to the toxic endpoint calculated by DEGADIS is 2.4 miles.  The release would affect public receptors.\n\n\n\nThe "

      "SummaryText": "alternative release scenario is based on a crack in a four-inch line allowing a release of 40 gallons per minute (gpm) of anhydrous ammonia.  The release is assumed to occur outdoors and takes 30 minutes to stop.  This failure will conservatively assume that 5,820 pounds of ammonia will be released to the atmosphere at a release rate of 194 pounds per minute for 30 minutes.  The BREEZE DEGADIS model is used to estimate that the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.4 miles.  The release would affect public receptors.\n\n\n\nIn general, mitigation procedures in place at the Dodge City facility include shutoff valves to isolate any line or vessel in case of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n1.4 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills.  Farmland National Beef is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Farmland National Beef has a preventative maintenance program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All inspection and testing procedures are addressed within this program.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, relief and check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\n1.5 Five year Accident History\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef has documented one accidental release during the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.6 The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef's emergency response policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, Farmland National Beef will react with the proper actions as listed in the Emergency Response Plan in association with the local emergency response agencies.  Local emergency respondees are familiar with the facility and the hazards of release.\n\n\n\n1.7 Planned Change"

Farmland National Beef is committed to continuously improving the facility's safety and working practices through employee involvement and development.\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently performed at the Farmland National Beef facility.  A number of safeguards identified during that PHA are being implemented to improve the safety of the anhydrous ammonia process as well as reduce the chances and magnitude of any anhydrous ammonia spill.\n\n"
