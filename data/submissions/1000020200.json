The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. More on the emergency response information is provided in Section 7 of the Plan.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, the facility's emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the covered processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe City participates in the Contra Costa County Community Warning System.  This emergency warning system provides for the alert and notification of the community in the case of potentially harmful releases.  This Community Warning System includes sirens and emergency alert receivers for schools, daycare, senior centers, and hospitals throughout the industrial corridor. Also included is the most advanced technology for emergency notification, such as automated radio, TV, and cable broadcasts for use throughout the County. The Community Warning System provides for on-going community outreach to educate the public about the most effective response (usually shelter-in-place) when the sirens sound.\n\ni-9  Continuous Efforts to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.

The WTP believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the Process Safety regulations, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. This participation is described in more detail in Section 6.10.\n\nHot Work Permit Program.  Pertinent personnel are notified when hot work (i.e., any spark-producing operation including grinding, burning, welding, brazing) is to be performed in a unit and they assure that appropriate safety precautions are taken prior to initiation of the work.  The hot work permit satisfies all of the requirements of Cal-OSHA Regulations. Hot Work permits and procedures are described in more detail in Section 6.11.\n\nContractors. On occasion, the WTP hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. The WTP has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the covered processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. This practice is described in more detail in Section 6.12.\n\ni-7   Five-Year Accident History\nThe WTP has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years."

The latter group involves itself in generalized safety concerns across all city departments, while the Public Services committee specializes in maintenance and operations functions of the department.\n\nThe WTP has also conducted studies and implemented safety programs, which are included as a part of its Process Safety Management program.  These include periodic Process Hazard Analysis Studies, seismic analyses and prevention program basics such as Management of Change and Incident Investigation.

The facility underwent modernization and upgrades in 1976-1977, which increased the rated capacity to 16 million gallons per day (mgd). In 1988-1990, the facility was modernized and upgraded once more, and while designed for production of up to 32 mgd it currently operates at a maximum of 24 mgd by a permit granted by the California Department of Health Services. In 1998 the plant replaced its on-site 6 million gallon reservoir. The systems for handling chlorine and ammonia were installed during the 1988-1990 modernization. \n\nChlorine is used at the WTP to disinfect raw water drawn from the Contra Costa Canal or from wells operated by the City.  Chlorine is typically packaged as a liquefied gas under pressure in steel containers. One ton cylinders of Chlorine are used at the plant, thus exceeding the 2000-pound threshold amount set by the EPA, 1500 pounds set by OSHA and the 100-pound limit set by the State of California.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used at the Plant in combination with chlorine, to control the amount of trihalomethanes (THMs) in potable water. The ammonia system is made up of the ammonia supply vessel, piping and valves. The storage vessel capacity does not exceed the minimum EPA or OSHA threshold of 10,000 pounds, but does exceed the California Cal-ARP threshold quantity of 500 pounds.\n\nThe limits of the processes include all the equipment, facilities and procedures to handle both ammonia and chlorine while it is under pressure.  Once these chemicals reach the mixing equipment, they are no longer in concentrations that would make them hazardous and pose little risk to workers and no risk to the public.\n\nSpecific quantities handled and details of the systems are included in the details of the applicable compliance submittals to both EPA and Contra Costa County.\n\ni-4  Worst Case Release Scenario - DELETED 6-1-04\n\ni-5  Alternative Case Scenarios  -"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place.\n\nProcess Safety Information. The WTP maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This information is important for conducting hazard studies, ensuring adequate facility modification and providing effective training for plant personnel.  These are described in more detail in Section 6.1.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis. The WTP conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP study. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on October 18, 2001. There was also a detailed seismic assessment conducted in 1995.  The PHA and its results are described in more detail in Section 6.2.\n\nOperating Procedures. For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the WTP maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. These are described in more detail in Section 6.3.\n\nTraining. The WTP has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating and maintaining the processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently"
