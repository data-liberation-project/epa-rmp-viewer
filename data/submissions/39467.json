In the event an accidental release occurs, Rural Gas is prepared to work with local emergency responders and authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.Facility Information\n        The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for retail sale to area farmers.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed from three storage tanks that when combined hold approximately 157,000 pounds of product.\n\n        The propane at the facility is stored, received and distributed from two storage tanks that when combined hold approximately 89,000 pounds of product.  The propane is sold for residential and agricultural use.  \n\n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n        Anhydrous Ammonia\n       A.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 78,795 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point is 4.2 miles.\n       B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potntial incedent is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .1 miles.\n\n       Propane\n      A.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a vapor cloud explosion. The maximum  quanity released would be 64,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to 1 psi overpressure is .3 miles.\n      B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a vapor cloud explosion after a 5 minute release of"

The standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111.  The facility uses NFPA 58 provision standards for the storage and handling of propane.\n\n5.The five year accident history\n       There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that:\n           -Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.The emergency response program \n       The facility has the following:\n          A. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 191038.\n\n          B.

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety or propane safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
