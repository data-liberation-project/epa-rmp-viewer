      "SummaryText": "This document is the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for storage and use of ammonia at Carson Cogeneration in Carson, California. Technical guidance for preparation of the RMP was taken from sources published by the Los Angeles County Fire Department, State of California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Industrial Hygiene Association, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and various industrial groups. Publications from these sources are generally accepted as standards of guidance by Administering Agencies throughout California. The Carson Cogeneration Facility uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration purposes. The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors and an automatic Emergency Shutdown System (ESD). The RMP requires assessment of off-site consequences to public health in the event of accidental release of ammonia to the atmosphere. Details regarding air dispersion modeling and consequence analysis are presented inthis document. As an additional precaution, all plant personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and the use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted as part of the RMP process. The PHA used the line-by-line HAZOP method, and the What-if technique. Based on the results of the PHA, the PHA team made recommendations to reduce risk and enhance safety. A seismic analysis was conducted for the original RMPP.  Based on this review no faults have been identified with a direct impact on site structures. The AHM handling equipment is not expected to suffer damage or leakage during the largest expected earthquake on the controlling faults: Elsinore, El Modeno, Peralta Hills, and Norwalk faults. An off-site consequence analysis was conducted to de"
