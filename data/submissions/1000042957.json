All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prevention programs are adhered to.  The Americold emergency response policies involve the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  It is in compliance with the EPA emergency response program requirement.\n\nAmericold operates two refrigeration systems to support a frozen food warehouse and uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  The refrigerant is located in two engine rooms and three frozen food warehouses.  The facility is manned nine hours per day, Monday through Friday.  The other hours through the week are unmanned, but the facility has trouble alarms and ammonia detection alarms monitored 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\".\n\nWorst case discussion removed per regulation.\n\nAlternative release discussion removed per regulation.\n\nThe general Americold Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following key elements:\n\nA.     High level of training of the operators.\nB.     Preventive maintenance program.\nC.     Use state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\nD.     Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the    participation of the operators.\nE.     Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures.\nF.     Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators in the awareness of the hazardous toxic properties.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program including training, Tampa Fire Department, Tampa Police Department and outside environmental "
