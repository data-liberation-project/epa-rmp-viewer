      "SummaryText": "Croda, Inc.\nAtlas Point Site\nNew Castle, Delaware\n\nRisk Management Program, 2024\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Croda Atlas Point site uses ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) as raw materials in the manufacture of various surface-active agents (surfactants). Surfactants are used in household, personal care and industrial applications.  It is Croda's policy to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations. Croda is in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), 40 CFR Part 68. This RMP resubmission is being made in accordance with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 68-190(b)(1).\nOn the corporate level Croda mandates safety performance metrics and holds each site accountable to attain the corporate safety goals.  Croda provides process safety training for key technical personnel at each site to ensure competence in identifying and mitigating hazards.  Croda sponsors a group dedicated to improving safe use of EO and PO with representation from sites worldwide, including Atlas Point.  This group has developed a minimum requirements guidance document for the safe use of EO and PO.  Croda has also mandated the appointment of a Site Responsible Engineer at each site, with the task of ensuring that industry design standards are followed.\nCroda has been certified by an independent auditor to be in compliance with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and the American Chemistry Council\u0092s Responsible Care RC14001 standard.  The standard requires systems to be in place and working to control environmental, health and safety aspects and minimize impacts to the community.\nThe Croda Atlas Point site has technical personnel whose work is dedicated to occupational and process safety as well as environmental stewardship.  They conduct process hazard analyses (PHAs) prior to the design, construction and operation of any process unit.  Records are kept of each PHA and the actions implemented as an"

      "SummaryText": "outcome of the review are documented.  The PHAs are updated every five years to keep them current.  The safety department also conducts incident investigations to determine the events and causal factors of each incident with the goal to improve safety and prevent reoccurrences. \nThe Croda Atlas Point site also has a Community Advisory Council, which meets quarterly to foster communication with our neighbors and answer questions of concern.  Participants include the Delaware State Police, the Delaware Bridge and River Authority, a local school district, local businesses and government agencies, as well as local community organizations.  \n\n2.\tFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Croda Atlas Point site produces hundreds of products that provide desired chemical properties for personal care products, household cleaning products, and industrial applications.  The site contains nine production units designed to provide the range of chemical specialties required.  Raw Materials are received in railcars, tank trucks, IBC totes and drums.  Products are shipped out in tank trucks, IBC totes, or drums.  Several of the processing units convert EO or PO to desired products.  EO and PO are toxic chemicals regulated under RMP.\nIn 2018 a new processing unit came on-line to produce EO from ethanol.  Previously, EO was received in railcars and was stored on-site in railcars prior to use.  The ability to convert ethanol to EO substantially reduces the amount of EO railcars stored on-site, replaced by ethanol a less hazardous material that does not need to be regulated under RMP.  The process of converting ethanol to EO consists of converting ethanol to ethylene and then ethylene to EO.  Ethylene is a flammable material regulated under RMP.  There is no storage of ethylene on-site; it is consumed as it is produced in the process.\n\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Croda accidental release prevention program include"

      "SummaryText": "s the components of EPA's RMP Prevention Program 3 specified in 40 CFR 68.65 to 68.87. The components include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractor work.  The Atlas Point site is also regulated under the OSHA PSM standard 1910.119 for the toxic and flammable materials on-site.\nAtlas Point uses expert industry consultants to advise on compliance with industry standards from NFPA, ANSI, API, ISA and others. \nSome of the safety features in use, categorized as passive or active mitigation systems include the following.\n- A network of 90 combustible gas sensors located strategically to detect leaks or loss of containment. Leak detection by the sensors will automatically trigger a staged response, starting with an alarm and progressing to firewater deluge, depending on the extent of the leak.\n- Ethylene oxide gas sensors worn by personnel in the process areas.  These sensors alarm if ppm levels of ethylene oxide are detected, allowing personnel to respond prior to exposure to harmful concentrations.  They also provide an early warning if there are leaks.\n- Remote emergency retention areas (or spill sumps) located away from the storage tanks.  The spill sumps were designed to contain releases of EO, PO, and ethanol.  The spill sump confines the chemical and is equipped with a water spray system to dilute and contain the spill, thereby reducing the amount released to the atmosphere.\n- A water deluge system is installed around process areas and storage tanks to quench fires and absorb leaks of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.  It is designed based upon the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards.\n- All of the chemical processing units have computer control and monitoring.  These systems monitor key parameters such as temperature and pressure and"

A redundant interlock system (Safety Instrumented System), independent of the computer control system, is in place to monitor and set the process to a safe state if critical conditions are encountered and the computer control system does not respond. \n- Alarms are wired and controlled through the computer control system and sound an audible alarm as well as a visual flag.  Alarms are early warning systems which send an alert of potential leaks. \n- Emergency backup power for key equipment and control components.\n- Packed column scrubbers are installed to capture the small amounts EO and PO emissions that are generated under normal operations. The scrubbers are designed to remove emissions at a much higher than expected concentration and rate to insure that emissions from a potential upset condition would be captured by the scrubber.\n- Relief valves are safety devices used to protect vessels by venting abnormally high pressure to a safe location.  Relief valves vent at elevations adequate to prevent any hazardous vapor cloud released from drifting back down to where it might cause exposure issues. \n- A dispersion stack for the EO Storage tanks\u0092 relief valve outlet was included to control and disperse emissions during an emergency release.  The stack insures that the concentrations at the ground level would be less than OSHA's Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) levels. The modeling used to design the stack included scenarios provided by DNREC and incorporated worst case scenario features.\nIn addition, Croda performs Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) inspections which will detect small leaks and repair them before they become a hazard. \n\n4. Five Year Accident History\nOn August 4, 2019 a Croda technician was completing a repair order for 0-ring change outs in valves used in EO service. The valve had been labelled for change out, but it was not communicated to the technician that the valv"

The technician received second degree chemical burns from the EO and was prescribed a burn ointment.  The technician was able to return to work with no lost work days. \nChanges were introduced as a result of the accident.\n-  Safe Work Permit, Line Break, and LOTO procedures were revised to ensure they properly assess the hazards of the work.\n- Appointed a project manager to oversee this construction/maintenance project.  \n- Reallocated Permit Writer responsibilities so those most familiar with the area are writing the work permits.\n- Retraining on PPE for Maintenance work involving EO.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nThe Croda accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Emergency Response section, specified in 40 CFR 68.90 to 68.95.\nCroda maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that describes the site's emergency response program. The local community emergency response organization, Holloway Terrace Fire Department, and the New Castle County Local Emergency Planning Council (LEPC) have received a copy of the ICP and have included it in the community emergency response plan. \nCroda has installed a set of sirens in the neighboring communities which can be used to alert the community of any hazardous release that may affect them.  \nIt is Croda's policy to respond in an efficient and effective manner to any emergency that occurs at the Croda Atlas Point site. Croda personnel regularly prepare for emergencies by conducting emergency drills that have included the local fire department.  A group of Croda employees have been trained to act as emergency responders and/or incident commanders.  Croda emergency personnel can be reached 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency.\nThe ICP includes the following elements:\n- Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about acciden"

This includes a public address system throughout the worksite used to give verbal instructions in the case of an emergency.\nIn addition, the site's emergency response program (ICP) includes procedures for the use of the site's emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance.  The emergency response plan includes timelines to review and update the ICP to reflect changes in the process units.  Croda trains all employees in the applicable procedures and informs them of changes."
