Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nCFP's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  It is the policy of CFP to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local environmental and safety laws and regulations.\n\nCFP's emergency release policy involves the preparation of a response plan and training of employees in evacuation and appropriate response to releases.\n\nB.  Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nCFP is located at 2851 N Bozzano Road, in the town of Stockton, San Joaquin County CA.\nSulfur dioxide (NACIS code # 31142) is the only regulated substance at CFP in quantities over the threshold limit.  The quantity of sulfur dioxide stored at CFP is 10,000 pounds.\n\nCFP utilizes sulfur dioxide as a preservative in a cherry brining process.  Sulfur dioxide is fed into two brine solutions:  an initial brine solution where cherries become firm, and a storage brine solution where cherries are kept prior to shipping.\n\nC.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nEPA guidelines for determining the worst-case release scenario were applied.  Dispersion analysis was conducted using the public domain code EPA's RMP* Comp(TM).  The distance to EPA end-point for the worst-case release scenario at CFP was determined to be off-site.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely because the facility utilizes a preventative maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment, and the facility has a training program that insures that only properly trained personnel operate the system.\n\nAn alternative release was also considered.  A release resulting from excessive flow of sulfur dioxide to the brine tank was the alternative scenario.  The distance to EPA end-point for this scenario was determined to be off-site.\n\nD.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCFP's accidental release prevention program is based in the following key elements:"

      "SummaryText": "*written operating procedure\n*training of personnel\n*preventative maintenance programs\n*written safety procedures and safety equipment\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere was a release of approximately 10 lbs. that occured on 10/18/99.  Local emergency response was notified and responded.  There was no on or off-site consequence with this small release.\n\nF.  Emergency Response Program\n\nCFP's emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n*emergency escape procedures\n*procedures for employees to operate critical plant operations before evacuation\n*procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation\n*rescue and medical training for employees who perform them\n*means of reporting fires and other emergencies\n*names of persons who can be contacted for further information\n\nG.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nCFP will continue to ensure that all its employees are properly trained, and that all safety processes and procedures are followed."
