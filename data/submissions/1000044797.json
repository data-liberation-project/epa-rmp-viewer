The facility has determined that the quantity of acetylene may reach the regulatory threshold under RMP.  \n\n\n\nThe Goldsboro facility conducts its operations to prevent the accidental release of acetylene.   In addition to being in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule, the facility also follows industry standards found in applicable Compressed Gas Association and NFPA documents. In the event of an acetylene release, mitigation controls include; the plant alarm system, LEL sensors inside the plant, the plant deluge system, as well as a deluge system and water cannons in the acetylene trailer storage bays.  \n\n\n\nThe Airgas National Welders facility in Goldsboro, NC has not had an acetylene release related accident within the past 5 years.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program - The Goldsboro facility has a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to be implemented in case of an accident resulting in the uncontrolled release of acetylene.  The Plan is coordinated with local responders (fire department).\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no plans to add additional safety measures.\n\n"
