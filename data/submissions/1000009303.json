To this end, Frontier's staff strives to conduct all activities in accordance with industry standards.  Frontier considers safety as a condition of employment and emphas safety in the workplace.  Personnel are required to demonstrate their commitment to safety by regularly attending safety meetings and undergoing regular refresher training on safety and environmental topics.  They are also encouraged to be involved in the facility's behavior-based safety program.\n\nSource Description and Part 68 Regulated Substances Handled \nFrontier Refining Incorporated's (Frontier's) Cheyenne Refinery processes approximately 52,000 barrels per day of crude oil supplied from Canada, Wyoming, and adjacent states.  The refinery consists of approximately fifteen process units that separate, chemically react, and finally blend the crude oil components into gasoline, diesel, asphalt, petroleum coke, and other products.  In addition, the refinery has over one hundred storage tanks for storing the raw materials, intermediates, and products prior to shipment by pipeline or truck.\n\nThree 40 CFR Part 68 regulated substances are present in the processes at the Frontier facility in amounts above the specified threshold quantities.  These substances are common to most petroleum refineries and are:\n\n-Chlorine, used to control algae growth in the refinery's cooling towers.  Chlorine is a gas at normal conditions and is toxic above a certain concentration in the air.\n\n-NFPA 4 flammable mixtures that contain the regulated substances hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, propene, butane, isobutane, butene, and/or pentane.  These substances are chemical"

HF is a gas at normal conditions and is toxic above a certain concentration in the air.\n\nFrontier's Accidental Release Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nFrontier implements and administers the RMP accidental release program through OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which requires the same program elements.  Frontier has an individual designated as the PSM Manager who is responsible for the implementation and administration of the program.  There are eleven processes at the refinery which contain RMP-regulated substances above threshold quantities:\n\n    Cooling Water Treatment (chlorine)\n    LPG Storage (NFPA 4 flammables)\n    HF Alkylation Unit (NFPA 4 flammables and hydrofluoric acid)\n    Butamer Unit (NFPA 4 flammables)\n    Crude Unit (NFPA 4 flammables)\n    Naphtha Hydrotreating (Hydrobon) Unit (NFPA 4 flammables)\n    Catalytic Reforming (Platformer) Unit (NFPA 4 flammables)\n    Gasoline Hydrotreating (Scanfiner) Unit (NFPA 4 flammables)\n    Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) (NFPA 4 flammables)\n    Gas Concentration Unit (NFPA 4 flammables)\n    Delayed Coking Unit (NFPA 4 flammables)\n\nChlorine is stored at the facility in 2,000 lb cylinders only.  This limits the amount that could be released by a cylinder failure.  \n\nNFPA 4 flammable mixtures are used in several areas throughout the plant.  Frontier's personnel are trained to be very aware of hydrocarbon leaks.  Through the Hot Work Permit program and the Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) program, regular monitoring is conducted with calibrated instruments to check for and direct the repair of leaks.  Operators in all units have hand-held monitors for the detection of hydrocarbons, and several units have fixed hydrocarbon detectors.  Frontier also maintains firewater monitors, deluge systems, and water curtains near the areas.  \n\nHF acid"

FrontierAA?s personnel are trained to be very aware of HF leaks.  In addition, equipment connections are painted with a reactive paint that changes color in the presence of HF.  This provides indication of any leak at a connection.  In addition to the HF-specific measures, the measures outlined previously for NFPA 4 flammable substances also apply at the Alkylation Unit.  These measures are effective at detecting and mitigating HF leaks, since in most places in the unit, hydrocarbons are present with the HF acid, and HF acid is very soluble in water.  Open-path hydrocarbon monitors are installed in the unit.  Finally, closed-circuit video cameras are placed throughout the unit to aid the operators' monitoring of the unit and direct the deluge water cannons in the event of a release.\n\nFrontier's Five Year Accident History\nIn the past five years, Frontier has had two accidental release from a covered process that resulted in injuries to company personnel as well as significant property damage on site.  The events did not result in any deaths or offsite injuries.  Known offsite impacts and/or environmental damage, if any, are included with the following narratives of the events.  \n\nOn Friday, January 5, 2007, at approximately 1:00 pm, an explosion and fire occurred at the Coker API Separator.  The resulting fire was contained and extinguished by Frontier Fire Rescue personnel by approximately 1:30 pm.  The separator was blanketed with firefighting foam as a precautionary measure, and the all-clear was sounded at approximately 2:00 pm.  There was one recordable injury associated with the incident.  The injured employee was transported by ambulance to the hospital for evaluation and treatment of a scalp wound and abrasions on the right hand.  The injured employee was released from the hospital on the same day.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 28"

The resulting fire was contained and extinguished by Frontier Fire Rescue personnel within the hour.  The all-clear was sounded at 9:00 am.  There was one first-aid injury (strained ankle) associated with the incident response; it was treated on-site and the individual returned to work.  Oily soot from the fire went northward over the city, and oily soot deposits were noted in an approximately 30-block area.  Residents in the impacted area were contacted and remediation of the impacts (mainly carwashing) was paid for by the refinery.  \n\nFrontier's Emergency Response Program\nGeneral\nAll refinery personnel, contract workers, and unescorted visitors are required to complete an annual basic facility hazards awareness program prior to proceeding onto the operational areas of the refinery.  This program includes how to recognize emergency alarms and what to do in the event an alarm is sounded.   \n\nFrontier Employees\nA majority of the refinery's non-managerial and non-administrative employees, as well as some contractors undergo annual first responder training (approximately three hours).  This covers usage of a self-contained breathing apparatus, basic awareness of Frontier's firefighting and spill response equipment, fire extinguisher training on a live fire, and usage of a fire hose.\n\nFire Brigade\nFrontier's Fire Brigade is comprised of forty-one facility personnel that respond to refinery emergency situations involving fires and/or hazardous materials, including those subject to RMP.  Fire Brigade personnel receive an initial 32-hour training in industrial firefighting at either Texas A&M University Fire School or University of Nevada-Elko Fire Science Academy and an initial 24-hour OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training held locally.  The Fire Brigade personnel also drill once a month for approximately four hours, attend an eight-hour HAZWOPER refre"

Twenty-three personnel are also certified as structural firefighters and can back up the City of Cheyenne Fire Rescue personnel on structure fires if needed.\n\nFrontier maintains an off-site firehouse next to the refinery with several firefighting vehicles: a fast-attack truck, a 1250-gallon foam pumper, a 1250-gpm pumper engine (foam-capable), a 2000-gpm \"Hired Gun\" self-educting foam nozzle trailer, and a 1200-gallon foam nurse trailer.  A 1250-gpm \"Telesquirt\" pumper/ladder engine and a hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response trailer are stored offsite.  The HAZMAT trailer contains equipment primarily for spill containment, decontamination and cleanup.  Frontier also maintains a live fire fighting facility onsite.\n\nMedical Personnel\nApproximately thirty of Frontier's employees are trained to respond to medical injuries to the Basic Emergency Care level.  This training consists of an initial 40-hour training as well as ongoing continuing education requirements and biannual certification.  Frontier also has one nurse on duty at the facility and six employees who are certified Emergency Medical Technicians.  Frontier retains a company doctor who has an office off site.\n\nIncident Command \nFrontier has three employees trained as Incident Commanders using the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS) Incident Command System (ICS).  These employees have received an initial eight-hour training in ICS.  Frontier conducts tabletop ICS drills approximately once a month.  Each incident commander, as well as other employees serving in the ICS, attend approximately two such drills per year.\n\nOffsite Responders Coordination\nFrontier's Fire Brigade participates in drills with the City of Cheyenne Fire Rescue once or twice a year and Frontier is a member of, and the Fire Chief participates in, the Laramie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

The mutual aid organization can provide additional response equipment, materials, and personnel in the event of a large emergency.  The organization maintains and updates a directory of mutual aid resources.\n  \nCommunity Monitoring\nIn 2008, Frontier purchased equipment for and built two offsite incident response kits to aid in monitoring the community in the event of a release of a hazardous/toxic chemical.  These kits include instruments for detecting hydrocarbons, chlorine, hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfur dioxide; hand-held meteorological instruments; maps and digital cameras for documentation; and emergency response information (both general and chemical-specific).\n\nCommunity Notification\nIn the event of an emergency event or a non-emergency event that may be mistaken for an emergency (e.g. fire training exercise), Frontier contacts the city 911 operator.  In the case of a large or highly visible event, the Laramie County Emergency Management Agency (LCEMA) may be notified as well.  Any community notifications, whether for informational purposes only, shelter-in-place, or evacuations, are handled through the 911 operator or the LCEMA.  These public agencies have the following notification methods at their disposal:\n\n-    Outdoor warning sirens:  Approximately 34 sirens are located in Cheyenne.\n-    Emergency Alert System:  A system through which local radio and television outlets distribute emergency information.\n-    \"Code Red\":  A \"reverse-911\"- type automatic telephone notification system "

Frontier funds 50% of the annual fee associated with the program.\n\nFinally, Frontier's own refinery sirens are audible to the nearby community and would likely be the first alert heard in the event of a chemical emergency.\n\nFrontier also participates in the county's Shelter In Place program.  This program is a countywide effort to provide information and procedures for citizens on how to survive a chemical emergency in their homes or other buildings when evacuation could be more dangerous.  The aforementioned systems and programs are communicated directly to the local residents and other potentially impacted populace by a variety of people and organizations, including city and county officials, senior refinery management, and through the county's website (www.laramiecounty.com)\n\nFrontier's Planned Changes to Improve Safety at the Facility\nIn response to a facility siting study conducted in May, 2005, Frontier designed and constructed a new administration office building away from the process units.  The administration building was occupied in early spring of 2008.  Two operator shelters/control rooms were also designed to move operations personnel away from the immediate proximity of the process units.  The shelters are positive pressure and are designed to resist forces generated in the event of an explosion.  As of June, 2008, one of the shelters has been built and is occupied, and the second shelter is nearing completion.  Personnel will move into this second shelter shortly.\n\nIn 2010, Frontier began retrofitting the cooling towers to utilize a bleach solution instead of the chlorine.  When all of the cooling towers are retrofitted, chlorine will no longer be used on site in quantities over the RMP threshold.\n"
