      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention policy at Royster Clark of Armstrong Iowa involves, but not limited to technologies,procedures, and management pratices.  All applicable procedures of  the ANSI K-61.1-1989 revision of the \"safe requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" as adopted by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship(IDALS) are adhered to.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  This facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a capacity of 30,000 gallons of water. The storage tank, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is manned during the season and is operational  through normal business hours.  \n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"altermative\"release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of one vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The altermative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \"worst-case\"release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the entire tank, releasing the entire 131,325 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The offsite consequences were calculated using RMP Comp.  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with a \"F\" atmospheric stability class.  A rural topography was selected as typical.  The distance to the endpoint was 6.9 "

      "SummaryText": "miles.  It is estimated that 1500 people would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario assumed a hose breaks and leaks 26640 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using rural topography and RMP Comp for the toxic endpoint of 1.8 mile.  The popluation with in that area is estimated to be 30 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.\n\nRoyster Clark of Armstrong has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years.  Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nRoyster Clark has several key elements in it's accident prevention plan:\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations.\n2. Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring or transporting of product.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5. Annual inspections by IDALS fertilizer inspectors include safety equipment,tanks and handling equipment\n6. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
