This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland Fire Department and Midland LEPC which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nN&B Midland Site is a primarily chemical manufacturing, which also includes specialty products.\r\nThere are (2) covered processes, three (3) programs, and six (6) regulated substances present at N&B Midland Site.  \r\n\r\nThe regulated substances are listed below:\r\nRegulated Substances:\r\nEthyl chloride\r\nEthyl Ether (diethyl ether)\r\nHydrogen Chloride\r\nMethyl chloride\r\nMethyl Ether\r\nPropylene oxide\r\n\r\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection:\r\nThere is one (2) toxic worst case and one (2) flammable worst case reported.  For the toxic worst-case scenario, the selection was based upon the furthest endpoint distance and the greatest impacted receptors.  For the flammable worst-case scenario, the selection was based upon the furthest endpoint distance and since there are no impacted receptors other variables were considered such as maximum capacities, location/distance to the fence line, and predominant wind direction. There are six (6) total alternate cases, two of which are flammable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nN&B Midland Site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention"

Modifications to existing structures are also done in compliance with applicable company standards and governing agency requirements.  Several processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 19 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nN&B Midland Site maintains detailed records of safety information that, among other things, describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all covered processes.  Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information, including Safety Data Sheets for materials used on-site, equipment and engineering design specifications, and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\nN&B Midland Site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  For initial screening and risk evaluation, calculations of The Dow Chemical Fire and Explosion and Chemical Exposure Indices are performed, and a Reactive Chemical and Process Hazard Analysis is conducted.  These methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses that may include:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), Fault Tree Analysis and Safer Technology and Alternative Analysis (STAA).  A team of qualified personnel performs the studies along with experts in engineering and process operations.

Audits are conducted using an established schedule for the site.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nN&B Midland Site promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root causes leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  The facility also investigates minor and near-miss type of incidents as a preventive measure.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nN&B Midland Site operates on the premise that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues, to attend applicable reviews, and to recommend improvements.  Improvements are solicited and implemented as appropriate.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors:\r\nOn occasion, N&B Midland Site hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction, and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is carried out.

The plan documents all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is updated as necessary to reflect any pertinent changes within the processes at the facility that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe facility works with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the facility emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\nEmergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced in order to ensure that it is functioning properly at all times.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of the accidental release prevention program.
