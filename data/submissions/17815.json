      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe Gonzales Surface Water Treatment Plant (GSWTP) produces approximately 1.75 million gallons of potable water each day for the City of Gonzales.  The plant uses approximately 90 pounds/day of chlorine gas to purify the water.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists chlorine as a toxic substance that is potentially harmful to humans and the environment.  GSWTP stores 8000 pounds of chlorine, liquefied under pressure, in (4) 1-Ton Cylinders.  The EPA requires the plant to have a Risk Management Program (RMP) because there is more than 2500 pounds of chlorine in storage.  \n\nThe City of Gonzales, like the EPA, are committed to chemical safety and thus created a RMP.  This commitment starts with the City Manager and includes the Utilities Director and all of the Plant Operators.  The purpose of the RMP is to prevent any accidental releases of chlorine gas and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The City Manager of Gonzales is responsible for the implementation and integration of the RMP.\n\nThe RMP consists of the following:\n7 A worst case scenario giving the radius and population around the plant that could be exposed to high concentrations of chlorine gas.   \n7 Two alternative case scenarios that are more realistic than the worst case scenario. \n7 Five-year accident history detailing GSWTP's accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five years.  \n7 Management System for implementing and integrating the RMP.  \n7 Prevention Program detailing safety information, the hazard review process, operating procedures, training, equipment maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n7 Emergency Response Program detailing emergency response procedures and accident investigation and reporting.\n7 Planned Actions to Improve Safety at GSWTP.        \n                                                                                                                                                                       Worst Case S"

      "SummaryText": "cenario\n\nThe largest quantity of chlorine released is assumed to be 2000 pounds (a 1-Ton chlorine cylinder) in 10 minutes.  The toxic zone around the plant is 1.3 miles with an estimated population of 6600 (the entire population of the City of Gonzales).  The toxic zone is the area around the plant with an airborne concentration of chlorine gas above 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm), which is harmful to humans and environment. \n\nThe model used to generate the toxic zone is from EPA's regulations, 40 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) 68.22, and program entitled \"RMP Comp\".  The model parameters, stated in 40 CFR 68.22, are reasonable and consistent with GSWTP.  The model assumes the atmosphere to be very stable causing a chlorine release to remain relatively stagnant in the air.  \n                                                                                                                                                                  Alternative Case Scenario #1\n\nThe alternative case scenario is more likely to happen than the worst case scenario.  This scenario assumes 2000 pounds of chlorine (a 1-Ton chlorine cylinder) are released in 10 minutes.  The toxic zone around the plant is 0.3 miles with an estimated population of 500 (greater than the U.S. Census Bureau estimate).  \n\nThe model used is the same as in the worst case scenario. The model is consistent with the parameters given in 40 CFR 68.22 and in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants 40 CFR Part 68\".  The toxic zone is considerably less than that in the worst case scenario because the program (RMP Comp) assumes the atmospheric conditions to be more turbulent in the alternative case.  \n                                                                                                                                                                  Alternative Case Scenario #2\n\nThis scenario assumes that one of the valves is broken off the chlorine cylinder resulting in a 1\" diameter h"

These procedures include performing equipment inspections, consequences for deviations from the procedures, and safety precautions.  The operating procedures will be updated when there is a change in any of the procedures. \n\nTraining-includes reviewing all the employees training records, determining who needs specific training, providing training for those without proper training,  and providing refresher training.
