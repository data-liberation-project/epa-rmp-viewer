      "SummaryText": "hyde (37%) involves a release from a ruptured transfer hose between Formaldehyde Storage Tank T-8452 and the delivery Tanker Truck with a release of 185 lb. of Formaldehyde.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of Formaldehyde (37% solution) is 0.11 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Oleum (65%) (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] involves a release from a ruptured transfer hose between the Oleum Storage Tank T-8461 and the dekivery Tanker Truck with a release of 120 lbs. of Oleum.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 45.24 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.01000 mg/L of Oleum (65%) is 0.19 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) involves a release from a ruptured trandfer hose between Ammonia Storage Tank T-17 and the delivery Tanker Truck resulting in a release of 340 lbs. of Ammonia.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.
