      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at StanTrans, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is \"For-Hire Chemical and Petroleum Storage (Terminalling).\" This update to our Risk Management Plan is a predictive filing.  We may have up to 5 regulated substances present at our facility at any given time. These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, 1,3-Pentadiene, 1-Butene, Isoprene [1,3-Butadiene, 2-methyl-] and Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-]. \n\nStanTrans does not use or process these chemicals.  Rather, StanTrans provides storage services on a contract basis.  The only activities affecting the listed substances are tank storage and transfer of products to and from transport vessels (including rail cars, tank trucks, barges, and ships).\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Storage and Transfer. In this scenario 14910575 lb. of Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] is released. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form "

Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario. These mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the actual surface area of the pool resulting from the release, thereby reducing the actual emission rate.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] involves a release from Storage and Transfer. The scenario involves the release of 24051.00 lb. of propylene oxide due a transfer hose rupture. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 5.53 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L of Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] is 0.87 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Storage and Transfer. In this scenario 12676889 lb. of 1,3-Pentadiene is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 1.84 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Storage and Transfer. The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion. The scenario involves the release of 20448.00 lb. of 1,3-Pentadiene in five minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.14 miles.\n\n4. The General Accident"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nStanTrans, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What-If and HAZOP methods in combination. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/15/1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, StanTrans, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nStanTrans, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nStanTrans, Inc. carr"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at StanTrans, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 04/20/1999. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at StanTrans, Inc. The most recent review was performed on 12/31/1998. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nStanTrans, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The next compliance audit will be conducted prior to June 21, 2002.\n\nIncident Investigation\nStanTrans, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. StanTrans, Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.
