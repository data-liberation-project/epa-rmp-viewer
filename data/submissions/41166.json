Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJCI is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Corporate policy dictates that facilities continuously identify methods to provide the safest working environment possible to its employees and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safer technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the corporate policy and compliance/procedure manuals, which are available to all employees. This facility stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in written materials available at the facility. This facility's safety and environmental programs include monthly safety meetings of all employees. JCI has an environmental manual and a safety manual that cover general environmental and safety best practices and compliance topics. Each employee at this facility has access to the environmental and safety manuals that cover topics specific to this facility.  There are regularly scheduled safety and environmental audits conducted by facility management, and periodic safety and environmental audits of the facility conducted by JCI corporate personnel. This risk management program document has been prepared to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations as stated in 40 CFR Part 68 (Appendix A)\n\n2. The JCI Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary function of this facility is to protect public health by supplying chemicals including chlorine and sodium hypochlorite to disinfect bulk water systems. The primary operations conducted at this facility include the storage and distribution of inorganic chemicals. Chemicals are bought on site where they are temporarily stored prior to being transported to c"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe prevention programs described in this facility's Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigations) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls). All covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressures, flow, and level) within allowable limits. The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed allowable limits. This facility developed procedures and conducted training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits (safety and operability) to ensure the correct response to the alarms. Safeguards to prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facility's Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals.\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility compiled a five-year accident history (January 1, 1999 - Present) for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage as required by the RMP regulations. The five-year accident history allows the facility to explain to the community the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the on-site and off-site impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that these accidental releases will ever occur again. The inten"

Two accidental releases were identified.\n \n5. The Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility does not have its own written emergency response plan. Instead, the facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. These activities are coordinated through the Broward County HazMat.\n\nThe facility does though have a detailed Emergency Action Plan to cover minor incidents at the facility. The facility's Contingency Plan Manual covers these activities.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAs, incident investigations, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at this facility to verify designs and to identify potential hazards. Recommendations may be developed as a result of those studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed and corresponding action items are developed to implement each recommendation.\n\nJCI facility personnel reviewed the following documents to identify all action items that were formulated to reduce the risk (severity of likelihood) of an incident that could have plausibly resulted in an off-site consequence (i.e., the emergency response planning guideline level 2 [ERPG-2] developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association for toxic gases):\n\n*      Accident "
