Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Archbold, Ohio - Specialty Canning facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we have trained staff in emergency response and are completely coordinated with the Archbold Fire Department and the Fulton County LEPC. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility primarily produces canned vegetable (La Choy) and meat products (Chili / Stews / Vienna Sausage).  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our two (2) closed-loop refrigeration systems (Engine Room 1 & Engine Room 2).  In that these engine rooms are in close proximity and managed by onsite personnel as one system (PSM Program), for the purposes of this RMP we are considering both systems as one process. \n\nThe purpose of the refrigeration system(s) is to provide cold storage capabilities for perishable products.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n \n3.
