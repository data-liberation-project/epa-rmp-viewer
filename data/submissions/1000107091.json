      "SummaryText": "The City of Reading's Waste Water Treatment Plant has onsite at any given time up to twelve (12) one ton containers of liquid chlorine and up to six (6) one ton containers of sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency responsiblilities have been instituted which include: emergency automatic shut-off's for each chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinder, an air scrubber system capable of handling a worst case scenario leak and a multi-sensor leak detection system with multiple alarms.  Additionally we have updated our operating and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Protective safety equipment including Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) has been placed in strategic areas and personnel are trained on its use.  An onsite emergency response plan, procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event that a local emergency response is needed has also been implemented.Lastly, an Evacuation Procedure with periodic drills has been implemented.\r\n\r\n   The chlorine Worst Case Release Scenario as described in this program is the release of the entire contents of 6 one-ton liquid chlorine containers in ten (10) minutes, or 660 lb/min.  For the worst case release scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec. and an atmospheric stability class \"F\" was used.  Using a combination of local data and an approved modeling program, the distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 2.5 miles.\r\n\r\n   The sulfur dioxide Worst Case Release Scenario as described in this program is the release of the entire contents of 2 one-ton liquid sulfur dioxide containers in ten (10) minutes, or 220 lb/min.  For the worst case release scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec. and an atmospheric stability class \"F\" was used.  Using a combination of local data and an approved modeling program, the distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 1.3 miles."

A release rate of 0.16 lb/min., a wind speed of 3 meters/sec. and an atmospheric stability class \u00bfD\u00bf was used.  This data when modeled produced no off-site impacts.\r\n\r\n   The dispersion modeling for both scenarios was conducted using Landview&reg;6 and Marplot&reg;3.31and site specific information.\r\n\r\n   No reportable accidents as defined in the RMP*Submit 2004 software have occurred in the last ten years.  Procedures are in place to identify and record any future reportable accidents and/or incidents.\r\n\r\n   The City of Reading plans to continue updating the program as required and will review the program every five years or when on-site conditions change such as processes, quantities or other items causing a change in the distance to the Toxic Endpoint."
