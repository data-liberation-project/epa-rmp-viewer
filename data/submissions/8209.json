We store on\nsite approximately 5000 # of Hydrofluoric Acid in 55 gallon drum containers.  These drums are bright red and kept on a safety pallet designed to hold 55 gallons of material.  The drum color and safety pallet\ndesignation are different than all other products at the facility, this is to insure that this material is given special consideration.  The material is stored and received inside the main warehouse, it never travels outside the warehouse, therefore, any outside release is highly unlikely.  The regulated substance is stored on the concrete floor of the main warehouse which is approximately 40, 600 square feet.  A typical batch will usually call for no more than 1 pallet (4 drums) of material.    This minimizes the risk of transporting a large quantity of material.  This material is transported from one side of the warehouse to the other- a distance of approximately 70 yards.  The material is transported by forklift, on a safety pallet to the manufacturing/mixing area and never leaves the confines of the main warehouse.  This material is raised by forklift, onto the mezzanine level floor, approximately 14 ft high.  The material is pumped and/or poured directly from the drum to the mix kettle.  Empty drums are stored in a drum storage area outside the plant to be sent off for reclamation.  Any spill or release of product will be contained in the main warehouse facility.  Visual signs of a spill or leak (vapor cloud, acid smell) are known to all plant employees that work in the main warehouse.  Employees are trained in spill countermeasure procedures and emergency response procedures concerning this, and all products. Additional changes to improve safety and awareness surrounding this and other hazardous products are continous.  Training for hazardous materials, spill prevention, and process safety management are conducted annually.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst ca"

      "SummaryText": "se scenario for this toxic liquid is the total quantity of the largest vessel.  Hydrofluoric Acid is received and stored in 55 gallon containers.  The worst case scenario is calculated for that amount to be released.  Worst case would be the spill of an entire drum in the main warehouse.  This could occur when material is received and transported to the storage rack or when material is transported to the mix kettle for use.  At all times drum is stored on a safety pallet designed to hold 55 gallons of material.  Immediate measures will be taken if material is released.  Personnel are trained to observe signs of release and spill  countermeasure plans. No outside impact is expected (endpoint is within a 0.2 mile [1056 ft] radius of the facility).\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nAn alternative release could be a larger release than a single container worst case scenario.  A catastrophic release of a pallet of material 220 gallons (2500 #) inside the main warehouse would constitute such a release.   This could occur during transport to the manufacturing level when perhaps all drums would fall from a height of 14 ft and burst upon impact with the concrete floor below.  Immediate remediation measures would the be taken.   No outside impact is expected (endpoint is within a 0.1 mile [528 ft] radius of the facility).\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\nNo reportable releases in this time period."
