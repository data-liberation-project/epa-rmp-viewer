      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary of StanTrans, Inc. Risk Management Plan (RMP) 5-Year Update\n\nIntroduction\n\nStanTran's existing RMP is being updated for the 5-Year Anniversary Date filing that is due at the EPA RMP Reporting Center by June 21, 2004.  Each section of the RMP was evaluated against current terminal operation to determine what updates were necessary.  \n\nAll materials stored at the terminal during this reports timeframe (see StanTran, Inc. Tank Master List dated June 11, 2004) were compared to the RMP Chemical Toxicity and Flammability Tables (\u00bfRMP List\u00bf) from 40 CFR Parts 9 and 68 to see if they were RMP listed chemicals stored above threshold quantity.  Per StanTran\u00bfs June 2004 Master List, the only RMP regulated chemicals presently being stored at the terminal above threshold quantity are Butadiene and 1-Butene.  The 1999 RMP submittal considered these two chemicals as well as 1,3-Pentadiene (piperylene), Isoprene [1,3-Butadiene, 2-methyl-], and Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-].  The RMP was also updated after 1999 and prior to 2004 to include the handling of Toluene diisocyanate.  StanTrans operates as a \u00bfTerminal-for-Hire\u00bf and could store one or more of these chemicals at any given time.  Each time a new chemical is to be stored it will be compared to the RMP List to determine if an update to the RMP is necessary.\n\nVarious EPA publications were used in preparing this update including the \u00bfThe General Guidance for Risk Management Program\u00bf, \u00bfChanges to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) in 2004 [EPA 550-F-04-002]\u00bf, \u00bfA Checklist for Resubmitting Your Risk Management Plan (RMP) For Chemical Accident Prevention [EPA 550-F-04-001]\u00bf, and RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance.\n\n                                                                                                                       \n1.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activity is \"For-Hire Chemical and Petroleum Storage.\" This update to our Risk Management Plan is a predictive filing.  We may have up to 6 regulated substances present at our facility at any given time. These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, 1,3-Pentadiene, 1-Butene, Isoprene [1,3-Butadiene, 2-methyl-] Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-], and Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer)  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-].\n\nStanTrans does not use or process these chemicals.  Rather, StanTrans provides storage services on a contract basis.  The only activities affecting the listed substances are tank storage and transfer of products to and from transport vessels (including rail cars, tank trucks, barges, and ships).  The quantity of the chemical on-site for evaluation of the RMP threshold quantity and for preparing the consequence analyses is based on the maximum storage capacity of the tank where the chemical is stored or is likely to be stored.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nButadiene and 1-Butene (the two regulated materials stored in June 2004 above threshold quantity) have been added as alternative release scenarios for flammable substances. Toxic worst-case, toxic alternative, flammable worst-case, and flammable alternative scenarios for other chemicals provided in the 1999 RMP and subsequent reports were retained even though these chemicals are not presently on-site.  The new alternative cases of butadiene and 1-butene do not exceed the catastrophe potential of the existing"

The offsite consequence analyses (OCA) for all release scenarios were reviewed for accuracy and updated as necessary.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analyses (OCA), StanTrans used EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Storage and Transfer. In this scenario 14910575 lb. of Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] is released. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 769.96 minutes. Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario. These mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the actual surface area of the pool resulting from the release, thereby reducing the actual emission rate.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] involves a release from Storage and Transfer. The scenario involves the release of 24051.00 lb. of propylene oxide due a transfer hose rupture. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 5.53 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.59 mg/L of Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] is 0.87 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-] involves a release from Storage and Transfer. The scenario involves the release of 35,700.00 lb due to a transfer hose rupture. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0070 mg/L of Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-] is 0.21 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Storage and Transfer. In this scenario 12676889 lb. of 1,3-Pentadiene is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion. Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 1.84 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Storage and Transfer. The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion. The scenario involves the release of 20448.00 lb. of 1,3-Pentadiene in five minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.14 miles.\n\nThe second and third alternative release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from storage and/or transfer that result in a Vapor Cloud Fire.  In this type scenario the distance to the LFL is determined which represents the maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences.  The second scenario involves the release of 1,3-Butadiene gas over a 10 minute duration at a release rate of 3000 lb/min that results in a fire.   In an urban environment (industrial setting, ground obstructions), with a D weather stability class, and wind speed of 3.0 meter per second, the maximum distance to the lower flammability limit (LFL) is 0.1 miles.
