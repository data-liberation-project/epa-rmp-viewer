A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe\n\npractices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving\n\nhazardous chemicals. This site makes use of the Clayton County Emergency\n\nResponse Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia\n\nemergencies. The site has specific and written evacuation and reporting\n\nprocedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the\n\nenvironment in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\n1.2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 1361 Southern Road,\n\nMorrow, Georgia.\n\nThe facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for\n\nconsumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported\n\nand distributed from this site. The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOne fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce. Fresh\n\nExpress has developed a Risk Management Program in compliance with the\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's final Rule 40 CFR Part 68. The regulated\n\nsubstance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold\n\nquantity of 10,000 lbs.
