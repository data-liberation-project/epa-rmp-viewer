      "SummaryText": "\nINTRODUCTION:\nThe City of Cape Girardeau, Missouri (City) operates a 4.5-million gallon day, public water supply treatment plant, Cape Rock Treatment Plant (Plant). This Risk Management Plan (RMP) fulfills the requirements of the Clean Air Act's Section 112( r ) for the Plant. \n\nPLANT DESCRIPION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Plant uses one regulated substance, chlorine, for disinfection to make the treated water safe for human consumption.  A maximum of six (6) 2,000 pound chlorine cylinders are stored and used inside the chlorination room of the Plant.  The potential maximum chlorine storage of 12,000 pounds exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  This RMP addresses the storage, management, and use of the chlorine cylinders. \n\nThe Plant is located at 20 East Cape Rock Drive, Cape Girardeau, Missouri.  It is on a bluff overlooking the river.  The surrounding area is residential.  Alliance Water Resources operates the Plant for the City.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\nThe worst-case scenario for a chlorine release at the Plant was determined to be the complete discharge of a full 2,000-pound chlorine cylinder in 10 minutes.  This is in accordance with the definition provided in the United States Environmental Protection (EPA) guidance for RMP development.  The release would be inside the chlorine room but there will be no response to reduce the effect of the release.  The conditions of the scenario such as time, weather and windspeed are those given in EPA's  Off-Site Consequence Guidance.  The area of potential impact from the chlorine release was determined using RMP*Comp.  The modeling software developed by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the EPA for this determination.  \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst-case.  A more likely scenario for a chlorine release at the Plant that might have an offsite effect is the "

      "SummaryText": "leaking of a chlorine line from the chlorine cylinder or the supply regulator at the cylinder.  The release would be inside the chlorine room.  The largest release rate would be a complete break of the line right after the valve on the cylinder.  According to the American Water Works Association Reserch Foundation, the release rate would start at 10.5 pounds per hour, then slow  down as the pressure inside the cylinder was reduced.  Since EPA's RMP*Comp Model does not have provision for variable flows, the 10.5 pound per hour release rate was usd for the entire duration of the release.  To give the fire department time to respond to the release and shut off the valve, a release time of 2 hours was used.  \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe plant has operation, maintenance, and inspection procedures designed to review the chlorination system routinely.  Personnel receive significant training before being allowed to work on the chlorination systems. \n\nAt he beginning and end of the daily operating period, and as each cylinder is changed, the valves and piping are tested for leaks.  There are operating procedures for startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operations.  Personnel are trained routinely on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  \n\nThe chlorination room is equipped with chlorine detectors and alarms that would sound if a leak occurred.  Ventilation is provided in the chlorination room only when a worker is present. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nThe Plant has not had a chlorine release in the past 5 years. .\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIn an event of an emergency involving any release of chlorine at the Plant, the fire department will be called to handle the response. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nBecause of the past work, there are no planned changes to improve safety at this time."
