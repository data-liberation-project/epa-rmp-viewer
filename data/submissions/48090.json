The new facility will be very similar to the two (2) existing facilities located in Lansing, Illinois and Searcy, Arkansas. The manufacturing processes consist of thawing, mixing, cooking, packaging, maintenance, and shipping activities. The regulated stationary source at this facility is the ammonia refrigeration system, which contains anhydrous ammonia.  It is utilized at the facility as a refrigerant to cool the buildings and freezers. This substance is listed as a Regulated Toxic Substance under 40 CFR Part 68 and is present in quantities that exceed the threshold for Accidental Release Prevention. \r\n\r\nLand OFrosts commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by Land O?Frost?s installation of the latest technology in process controls and monitoring detection systems and the implementation of a Central Safety Steering Committee. The properties of ammonia that make it valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. \r\n\r\nLand OFrosts policy in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of ammonia is to contact local emergency agencies for assistance as well as necessary contractors needed to respond, clean up and restore facility functions to normal. Land OFrost adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nThe Madisonville facility com"

The Process Safety Management Plan is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, and employee participation. \r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management Program ensures that the process and the equipment in the process is designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards and that the process is operated according to good engineering practices. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled inspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment. Preventative maintenance and replacement policies for parts and equipment ensure that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a release incident. All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to ensure an uncontrolled release of anhydrous ammonia is prevented.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nThe facility is new, and therefore there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at Land OFrost.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n\r\nLand OFrosts maintains an Emergency Action Plan, in lieu of an Emergency Response Program. Their  policy is to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. Land O?Frost has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local authorities will be notified by Land O?Frost and the local authorities will decide on whether local areas will be evacuated.

      "SummaryText": "local authorities will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary. \r\n\r\nSince, the Land OFrost facility is included in the community emergency response plan and maintains appropriate mechanisms to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response, according to 40 CFR 68.90, the facility does not have to comply with 40 CFR 68.95 and does not have to develop an emergency response program. Additionally, under 29 CFR 1910.120(l)(1)(ii), employers who will evacuate their employees from the danger area when an emergency occurs, and who do not permit any of their employees to assist in handling the emergency, are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they provide an emergency action plan complying with 29 CFR 1910.38.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nLand OFrost is committed to continuous efforts to improve the safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia process by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment and the system. The anhydrous ammonia process is designed in accordance with good engineering practices. Periodic auditing of the Process Safety Management Prevention Program ensures that any system changes or modifications are evaluated and necessary safety precautions and or safety improvements are made before the process is placed into operation."
