It is the policy of PPOET Glenville to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws. \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPOET Glenville operates an ethanol fuel production plant located near Albert Lea, in Freeborn County, Minnesota. The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and process by-products known as Hi-Pro Dry Distillers Grain, Bran Pellets, Germ which are used as livestock feed and CO2 which is used in the beverage and food industries. The fuel ethanol production process requires the use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain 30 to 40 per cent pentane, an RMP regulated substance. The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human comsumption. The maximum amount of gasoline on-site is estimated to be 47000 gallons. The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is loacted in the facility's tank farm which include secondary containment.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nIn addition to identifying regulated chemicals at the POET Glenville facility, the U.S Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan program guidance requires companies to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at the facility (as unlikely as that might be) and an alternative, more realistic accident scenario.\n\nR$MP*Comp, a software tool developed by the U.S Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration was used to perform an off-site consequence analysis for the POET Glenville facility. The analysis addresses natural gasoline.\n\nThe worst case scenario for natural gasoline as "

The software mdeling program considered release of 122200 pounds of pentane over a 10 minute time period as a vapor cloud. The analysis projected off-site endpoints for release of pentane.\n\nThe alternate case analysis for natural gasoline also used RMP*Comp and considered a flange leak with a 100 pound release per minute for 10 minutes and a subsequent vapor cloud fire. The resulting endpoints for natural gasoline was off-site of the facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Program\n\nThrough completion of the RMP, Agra Resources Coop. (dba POET Biorefining Glenville) has complied with the EPA requirements according to 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information and operation/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, management of change and incident investigation are conducted as needed. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAgra Resourcees Coop has not had a natural gasoline accident that caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is the policy of Agra Resources Coop to notify the Glenville Fire Department and evacuate employees from the facility."
