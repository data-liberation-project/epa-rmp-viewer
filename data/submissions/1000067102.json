This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Gas Processors, Inc.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Hambone Gas Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), nitrogen (N2), natural gas liquids (NGLs) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. \n\n\n\nThe Hambone Gas Plant processes 9.5 MMSCFD and consists of the following; inlet gas compression, a condensate stabilizer unit, amine treating, a sulfa treat unit, ethylene glycol system, NGL recovery, as well as all other associated utilities such as fuel gas, methanol and instrument air. Waste water, condensate and NGLs are trucked from the site and sales gas is sent to pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Flammable Mixture.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. \n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Hambone Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing"

Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Hambone Gas Plant  has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.    Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n\n3.    High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\n4.    Continuous monitoring H2S detectors located at strategic points in the facility\n\n5.    On call personnel available 24 hours per day.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.    Berms around atmospheric tanks\n\n2.    Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels/tanks from rupturing\n\n3.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n4.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\n\n5.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.    Trained emergency response personnel\n\n2.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n\n3.    SPCC Plan\n\n4.    Fire extinguishers\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Hambone Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including "

      "SummaryText": "proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel and emergency response organizations in the changes. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Hambone Gas Plant is coordinated with the Conecuh County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Hambone Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. Gas Processors, Inc. operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Brooklyn Volunteer Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\n\n\nHambone Gas Plant has not had any accidents because it has not been completed as of the date of this RMP. Therefore, the facility has no accident history.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Hambone Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.\n\n\n\nRecord Keeping\n\n\n\nThe owner or operator of the Hambone Gas Plant should maintain this documentation supporting the implementation of the RMP for five years (40 CFR part 68.200).\n\n"
