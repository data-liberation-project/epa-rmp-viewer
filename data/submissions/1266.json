Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe Utilities Commission, City of New Smyrna Beach Water & Wastewater Department is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This comprehensive accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  This prevention policy addresses areas such as:\n7 Design of new facilities or modifications of existing processes.\n7 Installation of new process equipment.\n7 Continued review and improvement of SOP's (standard operating procedures).\n7 Continued review and improvement of maintenance procedures.\n7 Employee training associated with facilities/operational disciplines.\nIt is The Utilities Commission's policy to implement appropriate safety measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n                                          \n2. Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe Utilities Commission uses two (2) regulated toxic substances in processes at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  Chlorine is the only toxic substance that exceeds the maximum threshold quantity as established by the EPA and will be the regulated toxic substance described below.  The current maximum inventory maintained is five (5), one ton cylinders of Chlorine for a total of 10,000 lbs.  This inventory of Chlorine is utilized in the routine daily treatment operation for disinfection of domestic sewage.  This facility is staffed 24 hours/day with State Certified plant operators as required/defined by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.  This continuous shift staffing allows personnel to closely monitor all of the plant processes and respond to any alarms that may occur.\n   \n3. Offsite Release Scenarios:\nThe ALOHA Model was used to estimate the offsite consequences submitted for the RMP Program 3, worst case and alternate case scenarios.  This information was used to create the lookup tables that were utilize"

A chlorine temperature correction factor (1.0239) based on the highest daily maximum temperature for this facility was used to determine the maximum end point distance.\n\nAlternate Case Release: \nThis scenario assumes: Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 meters/second, temperature of 77 degrees F, and relative humidity of 50% which involves a 317 lb. total release from a one ton Chlorine cylinder at 10.5 lbs./min for a 60 min. duration resulting in a 0.48 mile or 2,516 feet distance to end point.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\nThe Utilities Commission, City of New Smyrna Beach Water & Wastewater Department's prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n7 High Level of training of operational staff.\n7 City Fire Department designated as first response team.\n7 Preventive maintenance program.\n7 The use of state-of-the-art processes and safety equipment.\n7 Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with operational staff participation.\n7 Use of hazard reviews of equipment and procedures.\n7 Incident Investigation program.\n7 Full time Safety Officer.\n7 City Fire Department & Utilities Commission employee joint training sessions.\nChemical-specific prevention steps include:\n7 On-site availability of a one ton container, emergency repair B Kit.\n7 Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) used by the operational staff during hazardous gas\n  supply connection/disconnection emergencies.\n7 Awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of each hazardous gas used at this facility. \n7 The use of vacuum gas feed equi"

Five-year Release History:\nNo accidental releases of hazardous gases have occurred at any of the City of New Smyrna Beach Utilities Commission's facilities in the past five years.\n                                                                                                                                            \n6. Emergency Response Program:\nThe Utilities Commission, City of New Smyrna Beach has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated and reviewed by the City of New Smyrna Beach Fire Department.  This program includes an emergency response decision and notification plan designating them as the first responder for any chemical releases or other emergencies at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  Routine joint training sessions have been held on-site with plant and fire rescue personnel simulating release scenarios and other related chemical emergencies. \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSeveral changes have resulted from the development and implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Most of these concerns were discovered while performing the process hazard assessment review and included:\n7 Improved signage practices.\n7 The installation of a wind direction indicators at the plant entrance and equipment/container storage\n  locations.\n7 Updating of maintenance/operation SOP's (standard operating procedures).\n7 Safe storage of hazardous gas containers.\n7 Reduction of hazardous gas inventories.\n7 Continued training on hazardous gas equipment and procedures."
