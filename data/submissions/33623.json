Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place.  The hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique is primarily used to perform these evaluations. It is conducted by a team of people with operating and engineering expertise to identify and evaluate process hazards and mitigation measures. \nPHA findings and recommendations are prioritized, recorded and tracked to resolution.  Production teams are responsible for addressing recommendations through procedural, hardware, software, and administrative control improvements.  The final resolution is documented and retained. \nTo ensure that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Refinery periodically updates and revalidates hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is permanently shut down.  \nOperating Procedures\nThe Refinery maintains written procedures; available electronically via an internal Valero Wilmington web, that addresses various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and revised consistent with changes made through the ?Management of Change Process? and are annually reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  \nIn addition, Operating Limit and Consequences of Deviation documents are maintained, which specify response to exceeding upper or lower limits of process or equipment parameters.\nTraining\nThe Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all process employee"
