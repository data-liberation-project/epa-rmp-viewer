In addition, pressure relief valves automatically engage in the event the system experiences a very high pressure situation.  In case of an ammonia leak, four ammonia sensing devices will provide an alarm locally and in the control room.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe storage of aqueous ammonia at the City of Pasadena Broadway Power Plant is governed by many safety features.  Much of the safety of the processes is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the Broadway Plant operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The aqueous ammonia system is checked by operators on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nThe City of Pasadena Power Plant facility maintains tight control of the aqueous ammonia systems through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there are three mechanisms at the facility to minimize the impact:  1) ammonia vapor detectors, 2) liquid sensor, and 3) associated alarms.  There are a total of four (4) vapor detectors located in the following locations at the Broadway Plant:  Bermed Storage Area, Feed Pump Skid, Vaporizer Area, and Catalyst Expansion Joint.  All ammonia sensors activate an audible alarm in the Control Room and display an alarm on the computer control system in the Control Room to alert the operator at 5 ppm. The control room is always manned.   \r\n\r\nOther automatic protections that are designed to mitigate or prevent a release of aqueous ammonia include: containment berms surrounding the aqueous ammonia tanks are d to hold the entire contents of the tanks, double walled piping from the pumps' discharge to the stacks, and valves that will automatically engage to relieve pressure or vacuum (negat"

During the removal process of the sight glass, the operator released the pressure too quickly which releases a small amount of residual aqueous ammonia liquid into the operator's face, mouth, and eyes.  The operator was wearing safety glasses and rubber gloves.  The operator was sent to a nearby clinic and was diagnosed with conjunctivitis (pink eye) due to ammonia exposure.  There were no lasting injuries or damage on-site or off-site.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe City of Pasadena Broadway Power Plant facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP/CalARP document, which is maintained at the facility:\r\n\r\n  1.) To save lives.\r\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.) To protect the environment.\r\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe City of Pasadena Power Plant facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated"

Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe City of Pasadena Broadway Power Plant facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia related emergency, it is the policy of the City of Pasadena Broadway Power Plant to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.

If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe City of Pasadena Broadway Power Plant facility is located at 85 E. State Street in Pasadena, California. The facility is located at Glenarm Street and Arroyo Parkway at the northern end of the 110 freeway.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas.     \r\n\r\nIn the aqueous ammonia process, the liquid aqueous ammonia is pulled from the tank through the ammonia shut off valve by two pumps.  It then travels through double walled piping, underground, to the first level of the Broadway Power Plant.  There it flows through a strainer manifold and then travels up to the fifth level where it flows through a back pressure regulator control valve, a flow control valve to the vaporizer and then the injection grid.  The catalyst bed provides the surface area for the SCR reactions to occur.\r\n \r\nThe ammonia shut off valve remains open based on several permissive conditions including, but not limited to boiler load, reactor temperature, ammonia storage tank level, and metering pump operation.  The aqueous ammonia is mixed with compressed air prior to entering the vaporizer where it is mixed with hot blower air and then fed to either the economizer superheat-side or the economizer reheat-side of the ammonia injection grid in the combustion exhaust stack.\r\n\r\nThe NOx in the flue gas reacts with ammonia in the SCR reactor catalyst layers to form harmless elemental nitrogen and water.  The elemental nitrogen and water remain in the flue gas as it passes through the stack to the atmosphere.  The SCR reactor is designed for a NOx reduction efficiency of 89.3% when firing natural gas.\r\n\r\nThe SCR system is equipped with various automatic process controls which ensure safe and efficient operation of the"
