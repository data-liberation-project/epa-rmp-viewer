      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u0096 HARMON CREEK PLANT\n\nMarkWest Liberty Midstream and Resources L.L.C. (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Harmon Creek Plant and a subsidiary of MPLX, L.P., has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Harmon Creek Plant processes raw gas from the field gathering system. The unprocessed gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates the condensate and free water from the natural gas stream. The gas enters one of two processing plants where it is dehydrated before entering a cryogenic process where it is cooled, and the heavy natural gas liquids (NGLs) are removed. The remaining natural gas is sent to a sales line off site via pipelines.  The NGLs are processed further in a Deethanizer train where it is split into ethane and propane plus streams.  The ethane and propane plus both leave the facility via a pipeline. \n\nThe products at the Harmon Creek Plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components.  The regulated flammable substances include the same methane through pentane components.  This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities, and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\nrequirements set forth in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable wor"

The worst case and alternative case radii to endpoint were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In evaluating the worst-case and alternative-case scenarios, there were no administrative controls or mitigation measures taken into account to reduce potential off-site impact. Populations within each radius were determined using the Missouri Census Data Center and Google Earth mapping.  Several vessels within the facility process were evaluated for their release scenarios. Results of the worst-case release scenarios indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. Details of the worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenario are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP Plan.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. This summary addresses each of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program since the process at the facility that is regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation is also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS\u0092s). This information is supplemented by do"

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and\ncontrolled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA). HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and m"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention. Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nMarkWest maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, startup after a turn around, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a re"

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. The operating procedures are centrally located and accessible to employees.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Harmon Creek Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for the employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations unless they provide written certification that they have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their specific duties and responsibilities. MarkWest employees at the Harmon Creek Plant will be trained in PSM/RMP requirements upon hire as part of their qualification to work in PSM/RMP processes. Operations employees will undergo refresher training at least every three years. A training attendance record will be kept for training activities and a verification of understanding will be conducted by a performance evaluation or through testing.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nMarkWest has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: training; written procedures; inspections and tests; correcting identified deficiencies; and applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe"

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRS)\n\nMarkWest conducts a PSSR for a new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The PSSR will be reviewed and appropriately updated during the management of change process. The PSSR will ensure that: modifications were installed as described; no other changes were made outside the original scope of work; operating procedures have been modified and communicated to operating and maintenance personnel; necessary tests have been completed prior to start-up; site safety, fire protection, and environmental issues have been addressed; the startup plan has been reviewed; pertinent drawing have been red-lined or updated to as-built requirements; vendor files have been updated; and training of affected personnel has been performed and documented. Ultimately, these reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure compliance with the RMP, MarkWest periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Team membership will include at least one person knowledgeable of the system being audited. One member of the team must be qualified to lead the audit and be familiar with the auditing protocol being administered. The Plant will maintain a listing of non-conformances identified during an audit and document closure of compliance audit action items. The two most recent audit reports will remain on file with the documentation of closed items.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nMarkWest promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident. The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions that are identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nMarkWest encourages employees to participate in the facets of process safety management and accident prevention.\nExamples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a PHA team. Employees will be provided with the information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nHOT WORK PERMIT\n\nMarkWest uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process. The hot work permit documents the fire prevention and protection requirements prior to beginning hot work operations. The permit indicates the days on whi"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of the hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Harmon Creek Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Harmon Creek Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
