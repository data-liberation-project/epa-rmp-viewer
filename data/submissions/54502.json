Introduction\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Nation Pizza Products, LP (Nation Pizza Products) facility located at 601 East Algonquin Road in Schaumburg, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u00b7 Introduction;\n\u00b7 Nation Pizza Products policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7 Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00b7 Hazard Assessment;\n\u00b7 Prevention Program;\n\u00b7 Five-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7 Emergency Response Plan; \n\u00b7 Emergency Communications;\n\u00b7 Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u00b7 Planned changes to improve safety; and\n\u00b7 Management Program\n\nII. Nation Pizza Products Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Nation Pizza Products; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Nation Pizza Products is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Nation Pizza Products\u00bf policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This updated risk management plan is being submitted to comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 requirements to submit a risk management plan, every five (5) years.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.

Facility Identification\nThe Nation Pizza Products facility is located at 601 East Algonquin Road in Schaumburg, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of custom and branded pizza and dough related products for food marketers and manufacturers, the food service industry, and retailers in the United States. \n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311412. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients, pizza, and dough products.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating pizza products. \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #1 is approximately 13,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system #1 is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, and a frigo blast freezer.  This system is a two-stage system with four (4) high stage compressors and two (2) booster compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure pumped liquid from the receiver, the holding freezer evaporators are fed from the intercooler at 32 psi, and the frigo blast freezer is feed pumped liquid at 30 psi from another intercooler.                                                    \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #2 is approximately 32,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system # 2 is used to cool production rooms, spiral freezers, a cheese freezer, a holding cooler, and a plate and frame glycol chiller.  It is a two-stage system with three (3) high stage compressors and two (2) booster c"
