The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations as required in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.  The goal of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The RMP regulations apply to facilities that handle, manufacture, use, or store toxic and flammable substances above specified threshold quantities. In addition to the RMP regulations, both the State of Washington and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, as defined in Washington Administrative Code (WAC), Chapter 296-67, and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively. As the PSM regulations contain similar requirements to the RMP requirements, Kelso's RMP/PSM was developed with consideration to both.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve the anhydrous ammonia handling system and practices at the facility. Foster Farms incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely eve"

Foster Farms will rely on community responders for medical assistance and public evacuation or protection in place, if necessary. \n\nThe Foster Farms facility is located at 1700 South 13th Avenue in Kelso, Washington.  The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses.  The facility is in an industrial park that is generally bordered by Interstate 5 on the northeast and the Kelso Airport on the southwest.  The Cowlitz River, residential, and commercial development are located northwest of the industrial park.\n\nThe facility was constructed in 1998 for Foster Farms.  Operations at the facility consist of the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products.  The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 17,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling for production areas, product, water chilling, and ice making.  A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Foster Farms reported no accidental releases at the facility within the past five years.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling "

      "SummaryText": "systems covered by the RMP/PSM.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Foster Farms facility due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"?the greatest amount held in a single vessel?released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThe largest ammonia vessel at Foster Farms, the high-pressure receiver, has a capacity greater than the quantity of ammonia contained in the system.  The normal charge for the ammonia refrigeration system is approximately 17,500 pounds. Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of 17,500 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the high-pressure receiver is required for this scenario to occur.  As required by the RMP regulations, pessimistic atmospheric conditions, very conservative chemical dispersion characteristics, and a toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm) ammonia vapor were assumed.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario is approximately 1.35 miles.  This distance is slightly less than previously reported due to the use of atmospheric data more representative of the site.  The SLAB Model was used for modeling the worst-case release scenario.  SLAB was first developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.  SLAB has been revised and updated by the USAF Engineering and Services Center and the American Petroleum Institute.  SLAB is commonly used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases.\n\nFoster Farms used the alternative release scenario described in the EPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998.

The evaluation used a release rate of 75.2 pounds per minute and average weather conditions.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is approximately 0.12 miles.  The release rate and predicted distance are slightly different than previously reported due to the use of atmospheric data more representative of the site.  The SLAB Model was used also for modeling the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control system that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in the system are connected to a diffusion panel.  Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels.  Further, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n? emergency shutdown systems\n? component specific safety shutdowns\n? an ammonia leak detection system is installed that will close ammonia supply valves if a leak is detected\n? pressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\n? all pressure relief valves discharge to a water filled tank where the ammonia is neu"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lock-out/tag-out program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility.  The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A preventive maintenance system is being developed to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.
