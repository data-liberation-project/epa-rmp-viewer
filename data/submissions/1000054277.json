The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials. Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis. In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases. \r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 22312 Railroad Avenue in San Joaquin, California (the \"facility\"). Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer. There are two aqueous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with capacities of approximately 9,200 gallons and 15,000 gallons. The two aqueous ammonia tanks are located within secondary containment. The contents of the tanks are used as a pH adjuster during onsite blending of nutrient chemicals. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and Federal Risk Management Program. The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce"

The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps. \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use. Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility. Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\r\nFive-Year Accident History \r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\r\n \r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Fresno County Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of ammonia. The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release. The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures. The emergency procedures contain the following key elements: \r\n\r\n1. Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases. \r\n2. Information on emergency health care. \r\n3. Emergency response training for employees. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.

Install electronic level sensors with overfill protection on the ammonia storage tanks. \r\n3. Periodically inspect pumps to ensure safe mechanical operating condition. \r\n4. Ensure the operating procedures address temporary operations, address emergency shutdown and operations, startup following a turnaround or after emergency shutdown, equipment inspections. \r\n5. Include documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures to aqueous ammonia in the emergency response program."
