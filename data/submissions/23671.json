      "SummaryText": "1.0 Accident release prevention and emergency response policies:\nThe AGA gas Inc. (AGA) facility located in Wayland, Michigan complies with all\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)\nregulations and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes as well as all local, state and\nfederal regulations applicable to storage of Liquified propane gas.  If an emergency or release of\npropane occurred the Leighton Township fire Department would be notified and respond to the\nemergency.  AGA also has an emergency response team that can be called to respond to a leak.\n\n2.0 Description of facility and regulated substance:\nThe AGA facility stores liquified propane gas in a 18,000 gallon steel above ground tank that is\nfilled to 85% of capacity.  The process includes the 18,000 gallon storage tank, piping, pump,\nfilling manifold, automatic emergency closure valves, fire monitor and cylinders of various sizes.\n\n3.0 Worst case release scenario:  The worst case release scenario for the facility considers the\npotential failure of one 18,000 gallon propane storage tank filled to 85% capacity (administrative\ncontrols) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Utilizing a computer based RMP*COMP version\n106 the methodology presented in USEPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis the distance to\nthe flammable endpoint (1 p.s.i. overpressure) was determined to be <0.3 miles.  The public\nreceptors affected under the worst case release scenario include commercial and one residential\nproperty.  Approximately 4 persons are within the residential population affected.\n\n4.0 Alternate release scenario:\nThe alternate release scenario considers the potential release of propane from a 100 pound\ncapacity storage cylinder leaking caused by a leaking cylinder valve resulting in a vapor cloud\nexplosion.  The release period was 60 minutes.  Utilizing RMP*COMP the distance to the\nflammable end point was determined to be <0.1 miles and there is no commercial or resident"

Pre start up safety audits are conducted as\nwell as process hazard reviews are completed every five years and an audit completed every three\nyears.  Monthly inspections are also completed of the installation.\n\n6.0 Five Year Accident History\nNot applicable as this is a new facility.\n\n7.0 Emergency Response Program:\nIn the event of an accidental release involving propane it is AGA's policy to immediately notify\nthe Leighton Township Fire Department who would respond to the emergency.  The facility has\nan Emergency Action Plan which all facility employees have been trained on (annually) and they\nhave continuous access to the plan.\n\n8.0 Planned changes to improve safety\nContinuous audits and inspections of the facility and propane installation."
