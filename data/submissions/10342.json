      "SummaryText": "The primary activities at Goodwill Industries of Southeastern WI. are packaging of various SCJohnson products.We package the Glade Spin-Fresh in both primary carton and the refill carton,in various scents.We also package OFF Mosquito Coils in both the Primary carton and also the refill cartons.We also package Zip-Loc bags in gallon and quart storage ,Zip-Loc bags in gallon and quart freezer.We also do alot of SCJohnson QDR (quality deficiency report )which is one of the reasons for the RMP submit. The QDR's could be for various quality issues misalinaged labels,no day codes, caps incorrectly tightened, wrong shipping cartons, and aerosols cans,etc.The aerosol is the reason for RMP submit, which will involve predictive filing.The process chemical are Butane,Isobutane(propane,2-methyl),and Propane. At times we will not have any aerosol cans on site. When we have aerosol cans on site the amount will be dependent on QDR's coming from SCJ. We will never have a total of more than 53,665 lbs. in the building at one time. Any release scenario WOULD NOT have an offsite impact.  Goodwill Industries has a sprinkler system, which is also monitored by ADT Security Services. If there ever were an incident ADT would contact the Racine Fire Department."
