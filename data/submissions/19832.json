The RMP  is\nrequired  under  the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency  (EPA)\nRisk   Management  Program  codified  in  40  Code   of   Federal\nRegulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Delayed coking operations  are\nconducted in Area 3.  Refining operations are primarily conducted\nin  Areas  1  and 2, which are on properties contiguous  to  each\nother  but not adjacent to Area 3.  A separate RMP submittal  has\nbeen prepared for Areas 1 and 2.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  RMP  program is to  identify  and  prevent\npotential  accidental releases of specific \"regulated substances\"\nthat  have  the  potential to cause harm to the  public  and  the\nenvironment.   \"Regulated  substances\"  are  hazardous  chemicals\nidentified  by  EPA.   Because  BRC  has  quantities  of  various\n\"regulated  substances\" above a threshold amount,  this  RMP  has\nbeen prepared.\n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\n     Section 1:  Accidental  Release  Prevention  and  Emergency\n                 Response Policies at BRC\n     Section 2:  Overview of Regulated Substances at BRC\n     Section 3:  Worst  Case  Release Scenarios and  Alternative\n                 Release Scenarios\n     Section 4:  BRC Accidental Release Prevention Program\n     Section 5:  Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\n     Section 6:  Emergency Response Program\n     \n\n\nSection   1.      Accidental  Release  Prevention  and  Emergency\nResponse Policies at BRC\n\nEquipment  at  the various BRC units must be designed,  operated,\nand  maintained  in  full  compliance  with  applicable  internal\nengineering  standards,  accepted  industry  codes,  or  i"

This\nmethodology  was  used because the RMP rule  set  forth  specific\ncriteria  that  must  be  followed for  modeling  the  worst-case\nscenarios.   The  worst  case  scenarios  must  incorporate  very\nconservative,  simplified assumptions about  the  nature  of  the\nreleases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\nThe  EPA has defined the worst-case release scenario as one  that\nresults in the greatest distance from the point of release  to  a\nspecified  \"endpoint\".  As defined by the rule, the endpoint  for\ntoxics   substances  is  a  specified  concentration,   and   for\nflammables  is  a  specified  overpressure  from  a  vapor  cloud\nexplosion (VCE).\n\nThe  worst-case scenario for a regulated toxic is one  where  the\ntotal quantity in the largest vessel or pipe is released over  10\nminutes,  resulting  in  acute  health  effects  associated  with\nairborne  exposure.   For a regulated flammable,  the  worst-case\nscenario  is one where the total quantity of regulated  flammable\nin  the  largest  vessel  or  pipe is  assumed  to  vaporize  and\ninstantaneously result in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nA  summary of the worst-case scenarios for BRC Area 3 is provided\nin  Table 2.  As required by the RMP rule, the results are  shown\nfor  one  vessel containing a toxic substance (ammonia)  and  one\nvessel  containing  flammables.

These scenarios are more realistic than  worst-\ncase  scenarios for assessing the potential hazards posed by  BRC\nprocess  units and developing emergency response plans.  Although\nthese  scenarios  may be unlikely to occur, they  are  physically\npossible and reasonably feasible.\n\nExcept  for one flammable scenario, EPA OCAG procedures were  not\nused  for  modeling  the  alternative  release  scenarios.   More\nflexibility  is  provided  for  in  characterizing  releases  and\nassessing the impacts for the alternative release scenarios.  BRC\nprimarily used the \"PHASTProfessional\" model by DNV Technica  for\nthe  ARS.   PHASTProfessional is an advanced consequence modeling\nprogram  that examines the progress of a potential incident  from\ninitial  release, through the formation of a cloud and/or  liquid\npool, and on to final dispersion and flammable/toxic effects.\n\nA  summary of the alternative release scenarios for BRC Area 3 is\nprovided  in  Table 3.
