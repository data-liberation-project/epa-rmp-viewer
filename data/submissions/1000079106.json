Senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but to also maintain safety and environmental programs to promote a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding communities. This is accomplished through the implementation of the EPA Risk Management Program and incorporating Emergency Response capabilities at the facility level.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nSeneca Foods in Montgomery uses ammonia to provide refrigeration for cold storage and food processing equipment. The refrigeration system at the facility consists of piping, valves, process equipment, and ammonia.  The closed system cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature (i.e. lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature).  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia and discharged to the atmosphere as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 11.7\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to approximately 145 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the following risk management regulations are implemented:\n\n\n\n1)     OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and \n\n2)     EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.

      "SummaryText": "arizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Seneca to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the Montgomery plant.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their job tasks in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Seneca's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nOutside contractors are used to audit the Seneca ammonia refrigeration safety performance and program implementation.  \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the Seneca Montgomery refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  \n\n\n\nThere is an ammonia detection system in place to alert operators of an ammonia-related incident. These sensors activate alarms and key shut-down tasks depending on their location and setpoints.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\""

On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history on the Hazard Assessment Verification Form (See Appendix C) on April 22, 2019, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this criteria in the past five years (April 2014 - April 2019). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSeneca Foods Montgomery has a trained emergency team and has coordinated the emergency plan with the Montgomery Fire Department as well as the Montgomery Police Department through an offsite emergency plan, onsite tours, drills, and discussions.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nWe are continuously reviewing and upgrading our safety, health, and environmental programs. The facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the employees. These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
