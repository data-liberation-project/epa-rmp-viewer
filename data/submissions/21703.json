This commitment   is  demonstrated  by  the   resources invested  in accident prevention, such as training personnel  and considering safety in  the  design, installation,  operation, and maintenance  of  our process.  Our  policy  is to implement  reasonable controls    to  prevent  foreseeable  releases   of\nregulated  substances. However, if a release  does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n The   Dollarhide  Gas  Plant,  located  35  miles southwest  of Andrews (Andrews County), Texas,  on Highway   128,  operates  a  process  to    produce\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids),  from  natural gas. The  Dollarhide  Gas Plant  has several regulated flammables,  such  as propane and butane. The Dollarhide Gas Plant  does not   use  and/or  process  any  regulated   toxic substances above threshold quantities.\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n The  WCS  associated with a release of  flammable substances in the Program Level 1 process  at  the gas   plant  is  a  vapor  cloud  explosion  (VCE) involving the full inventory of the product  surge tank  containing  natural gas  liquids  (flammable mixture). A written procedure is in place to limit the  tank  inventory to 100,000 lbs. (80%  of  the maximum  tank  capacity); therefore,  the  reduced inventory  is  assumed  to  release  and    ignite,\nresulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi  endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 mile, resulting in  no  offsite impact. Although we have  numerous controls  to prevent such releases and  to  manage their   consequences,  no   credit    for    passive\nmitigation  measures  was taken  into  account  in eval"

The following is a  summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because the process at the gas plant  that is   regulated  by  the  Environmental  Protection Agency's  (EPA's)  risk management  program  (RMP) regulation  is  also subject to  the  Occupational Safety   and    Health  Administration's   (OSHA's)\nprocess  safety  management (PSM)  standard,  this summary  addresses each of the OSHA  PSM  elements and  describes the management system in  place  to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n The Dollarhide Gas Plant encourages employees  to participate  in  all  facets  of  process   safety management  and accident prevention.  Examples  of employee  participation range  from  updating  and compiling   technical   documents   and    chemical\ninformation  to participating as  a  member  of  a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access  to all information created as part of  the gas  plant  accident prevention program.  Specific ways  that  employees  can  be  involved  in    the\naccident prevention program are documented  in  an employee participation plan that is maintained  at the   gas   plant  and  addresses  each    accident\nprevention program element. In addition,  the  gas plant  has a number of initiatives under way  that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both   process  and  personal  safety.  The  teams typically have members from various areas  of  the plant,    including    operations,    maintenance,\nengineering, and plant management.\nProcess Safety Information\n The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant keeps  a  variety  of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe  operation  of the process.

Specific departments  within  the gas  plant  are  assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date  process safety   information.  A  table  summarizing    the\nreference documents and their location is  readily available   as   part  of  the  written    employee\nparticipation  plan to help employees  locate  any necessary process safety information.\n Chemical-specific    information,      including\nexposure  hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in  material safety  data  sheets (MSDSs). This information  is supplemented   by   documents  that   specifically address  known  corrosion concerns and  any  known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing  of chemicals.  For  specific process areas,  the  gas plant  has  documented safety-related  limits  for specific  process  parameters (e.g.,  temperature, level,  composition)  in a Key  Process  Parameter Document.  The gas plant ensures that the  process is  maintained  within these limits using  process controls   and   monitoring  instruments,   highly trained    personnel,  and  protective   instrument\nsystems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n The  gas  plant also maintains numerous technical documents  that  provide  information  about    the\ndesign and construction of process equipment. This information  includes materials  of  construction, design  pressure  and  temperature  ratings,    and\nelectrical  rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained\npersonnel,            provides  a  basis  for  establishing\ninspection and maintenance activities, as well  as for    evaluating  proposed  process  and  facility\nchanges  to        ensure that safety  features  in  the\nprocess are not compromised.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant "

Within this program, the process is systematically examined  to  identify  hazards  and  ensure  that adequate  controls are in place  to  manage  these hazards.\n The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant  primarily  uses  the hazard  and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to  perform        these evaluations. HAZOP analysis  is\nrecognized  as  one  of the  most  systematic  and thorough    hazard   evaluation   techniques.    The\nanalyses are conducted using a team of people  who have  operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates  hazards  of  the  process  as  well  as accident  prevention and mitigation measures,  and the    team            makes    suggestions  for   additional\nprevention  and/or  mitigation measures  when  the team believes such measures are necessary.\n The  PHA  team  findings are forwarded  to  local management            for  resolution.  Implementation   of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings  is based  on a relative risk ranking assigned by  the PHA team.

The  basic  aspects of this program  include:  (1) conducting   training,  (2)   developing   written procedures, (3) performing inspections and  tests, (4)  correcting identified deficiencies,  and  (5) applying         quality   assurance    measures.     In\ncombination, these activities form a  system  that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n Maintenance personnel receive training on (1)  an overview  of  the process, (2) safety  and  health hazards,  (3)  applicable maintenance  procedures, (4)  emergency response plans, and (5)  applicable safe  work practices to help ensure that they  can perform  their  jobs  in a  safe  manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent   manner  and  provide  a   basis    for\ntraining.  Inspections and tests are performed  to help  ensure that equipment functions as  intended and  to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will  correct  the deficiency before  placing  the equipment  back into service (if possible),  or  a management of change team will review the  use  of the  equipment  and  determine  what  actions  are necessary  to  ensure the safe  operation  of  the equipment.\n Ano"

The following is a description  of existing  safety features applicable to prevention of  accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n The   accident   prevention  program    summarized\npreviously  is applied to the RMP-covered  process at  the Dollarhide Gas Plant. Collectively,  these prevention   program   activities   help   prevent potential accident scenarios that could be  caused by equipment failures and human errors.\nSpecialized Safety Features\n The  Dollarhide Gas Plant has safety features  on many  units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2)  quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce  the consequences   of  (mitigate)   a   release.    The\nfollowing types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n Release Detection\n?     Hydrocarbon  detectors with alarms  in  the\n    engine room.\n ?    H2S Monitors\n ?    Ultra Violet detection in engine room\n Release Containment/Control\n ?     Process relief valves that discharge  to  a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n?     Valves  to permit isolation of the  process\n    (manual or automated)\n?     Automated  shutdown  systems  for  specific\nprocess parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n?      Redundant  equipment  and  instrumentation\n (e.g.,  uninterruptible power supply for process\n    control system, backup firewater pump)\n  ?    Atmospheric relief devices.\n Release Mitigation\n?    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n ?    Deluge system for specific equipment\n?     Trained  personnel  in  emergency  response\n    procedures\n ?    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical\nprotective  clothing,  self-contained  breathing apparatus)\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n The  Dollarhide Gas Plant has an excellent record (no  incidents that resulted in onsite or  offsite effects)  of accident prevention over the  past  5 years.

The\nDollarhide   Gas   Plant   incorporates    quality assurance  measures into equipment  purchases  and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment  is suitable  for  its intended use  and  that  proper\nmaterials  and spare parts are used  when  repairs are made.\nSafe Work Practices\n The  Dollarhide Gas Plant has long-standing  safe work practices in place to help ensure worker  and process  safety.  Examples of  these  include  (1) control  of  the  entry/presence/exit  of  support personnel,  (2)  a  lockout/tagout  procedure   to ensure  isolation of energy sources for  equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure  for  safe removal  of  hazardous substances  before  process piping  or  equipment is opened, (4) a permit  and procedure  to  control spark-producing  activities (i.e.,  hot work), and (5) a permit and  procedure to  ensure that adequate precautions are in  place before   entry   into  a  confined  space.   These procedures  (and others), along with  training  of affected  personnel, form a system to help  ensure that  operations  and maintenance  activities  are performed safely.\nManagement of Change\n The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant has  a  comprehensive system  to manage changes to the covered  process. This system requires that changes to items such as process      equipment,    chemicals,    technology\n(including      process-operating     conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed  and authorized before being implemented. Changes  are reviewed to (1) ensure that  adequate controls  are in place to manage any  new  hazards and  (2)  verify that existing controls  have  not been  compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits,  and equipment information, as well as procedures,  are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating  and maintenance personnel are  provided an"

The  goal  of   each investigation  is  to  determine  the  facts    and\ndevelop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of   the  incident  or  a  similar  incident.  The investigation   team   documents   its    findings,\ndevelops  recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for   resolution.  Corrective  actions  taken   in response to the investigation team's findings  and recommendations  are  tracked   until   they    are\ncomplete. The final resolution of each finding  or recommendation    is    documented,    and    the\ninvestigation  results  are  reviewed   with    all\nemployees  (including contractors)  who  could  be affected  by  the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so  that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n \nCompliance Audits\n To  help  ensure  that  the  accident  prevention program  is  functioning properly, the  Dollarhide Gas  Plant  periodically  conducts  an  audit   to determine  whether  the procedures  and  practices required  by  the accident prevention program  are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at  least  every  3  years. Personnel  from  other Unocal  facilities  who are knowledgeable  in  the audit  process participate as audit team  members. The   audit  team  develops  findings    that    are\nforwarded  to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the  audit team's   findings  are  tracked  until  they    are\ncomplete. The final resolution of each finding  is documented, and the two most recent audit  reports are retained.\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n The  process  at  the Dollarhide  "

The program consists  of  procedures for    responding  to  a  release  of  a  regulated\nsubstance, including the possibility of a fire  or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all  aspects  of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation  plans and  accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response  agencies and  the  public  if a release occurs,  and  post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of  emergency response  equipment, as well as instructions  that address  the use of emergency response  equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures  as necessary  to  perform  their  specific  emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to  the gas plant process or other Dollarhide  Gas Plant facilities.\n The  overall emergency response program  for  the Dollarhide  Gas  Plant  is  coordinated  with  the Andrews  County,  Texas, local emergency  planning committee   (LEPC).  This  coordination    includes\nperiodic meetings of the committee, which includes local    emergency   response   officials,   local government      officials,      and    industry\nrepresentatives.  The  Dollarhide  Gas  Plant  has around-the-clock  communications  capability  with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency  response organizations   (e.g.,  fire   department).   This\nprovides  a  means of notifying the public  of  an incident,  if  necessary, as well as  facilitating quick  response  to an "
