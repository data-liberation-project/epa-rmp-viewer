In addition to other generating facilities, TEC owns and operates the F.J. Gannon Station located on Tampa's Port Sutton Road in Hillsborough County, Florida.\n\nTEC is re-powering the existing coal-fired Gannon Station.  The repowered station will be natural-gal fired and will be known as the Bayside Power Station (BPS).  BPS will be comprised of two combined-cycle units.  Unit 1 will consist of three General Electric Model PG7241(FA) combustion turbines, three Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) and one repowered steam turbine generator.  Unit 2 will consist of four General Electric Model PG7241(FA) combustion turbines, four Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) and one repowered steam turbine generator.  The repowered plant will have a nominal capacity of approximately 1750 MW (approximately 750 MW from Unit 1 and approximately 1000 MW from Unit 2).  Steam from Unit 1's three new combined-cycle units will re-power existing Gannon steam-electric turbine Unit No. 5, which has a nameplate rating of 239 MW.  Steam from Unit 2's four new combined-cycle units will re-power existing Gannon steam-electric turbine Unit No. 6, which has a nameplate rating of 414 MW.\n\nAll of the existing six coal-fired boilers at Gannon will be shut down before January 1, 2005.  The overall thermal efficiency of the plant is predicted to increase from approximately 30% to 55%.  It is estimated that the Bayside project will reduce actual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by more than 28,000 tons per year, particulate matter (PM/PM10) by more than 900 tons per year, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by more than 50,000 tons per year.
