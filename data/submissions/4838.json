      "SummaryText": "Hayes  Heat Treating, a division of C.I. Hayes Inc is a commercial heattreating and brazing company. Located in the city of Cranston,  Rhode Island.\n\n Hayes Heat Treating(HHT) utilizes anhydrous ammonia in it's processing of parts for it's customers.  The amount of material stored on site is in excess of 10,000 lbs.  HHT is an active participant in LEPC #8. We have not had any accidental releases of materials in the past five(5) years. Hayes has  participated in voluntary RMP audits conducted by the University of Rhode Island chemical engineering department.\n\nThese results have been sent to the Dept. of Enviromental Management. A list of recommendations based on the results of the audit has been developed and HHT is actively appling these recommendations in order to improve compliance with federal and state requirements.\n\nPresently, the Cranston Fire Department will be the responders in the event of an accidental release or accident on site. The  fire department and the Chairman of LEPC #8 have inspected  the facility and grounds in order to respond in an emergency in a more effective manner.\n\nHHT utilizes an annual inspection of all piping, valves and the ammonnia tank by the ammonia supplier. Additionally, HHT inspects the piping and tank on a weekly basis.\n\nHayes' primary goal is to provide a safe and clean enviroment for it's workers and the city. HHT participates in the LEPC #8 meetings as a concerned representative of industry in the local community."
