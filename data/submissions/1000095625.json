      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDel Mar Food Products conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\n\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\n\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Del Mar Food Products facility acts as a stationary source for regulated substances anhydrous ammonia and chlorine. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in their operations and chlorine is used to disinfect their well water to be used in produce processing. To see a location map and site plan of the stationary source, refer to sheet T0.0 in RMP Binder Chapter 8 - Appendix 8.1.\n\n\n\n2.1. Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage, freezer storage, product freezing, and water chilling operations. There are five separate ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility. These are System-A, \n\nSystem-B, System-C, System-D, and System-E. System-E is the largest system with"

Currently, System-D is offline and pumped out of all liquid ammonia. The total charge for all the refrigeration systems is approximately 28,134 lb. System E (Spinach and Sprout Processing) is the only refrigeration system (i.e., process) subject to EPA RMP Rule. System E has 13,000 lbs. ammonia which is more than EPA RMP Rule threshold limit of 10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration drawings are located in RMP Binder Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 - Refrigeration System Drawings. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found within the equipment layout drawings. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in RMP Binder Chapter 12 Appendix, describe equipment details.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are either single- or two-stage vapor compression cycles operating at one or two suction pressures. System A and E are two-stage systems, and System B and C are single stage refrigeration systems. In general, the process chemistries for these systems are shown in RMP Binder Chapter 8 Process Safety Information. The total refrigeration charge is completely sealed and pressurized within the system.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See RMP Binder Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe total quantity of ammonia currently at the site is "

All pressure vessels and the compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. All low side vessels that are connected directly to the suction of compressor is installed with high level float switches that shuts down compressor upon detection of high liquid level in the vessel. All cold storage rooms and the refrigeration machinery rooms are installed with ammonia sensors that triggers an alarm upon detection of ammonia vapor. Exhaust fans are installed in the engine rooms. System A ammonia detection system sends alarm to the First Alarm company, which calls facility refrigeration personnel, and triggers the visual alarm outside of the engine room. System B, C and E ammonia detectors triggers the visual alarms outside of the dedicated engine rooms.\n\n\n\n2.2. Chlorine\n\n\n\nChlorine is used to disinfect well water, which is then used as process water. The chlorine is stored in 150-lb. gas cylinders chained in a bin located outdoors next to the well shed. Only one cylinder is used at a time. The cylinder in use is secured separately with chain to a support system that is anchored to the ground. The cylinder in use is connected to the chlorine feed system which injects chlorine into the well pump discharge line that supplies the facility water. Once cylinders are empty, they are replaced and chained into another storage bin. The location of the chlorine system and a detailed P&ID can be found in RMP Binder Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1.\n\n\n\nDel Mar Food Products maintains one storage bin with full cylinders, where they will keep no more than eight (8) 150-lb cylinders at a time for a maximum charge of 1,200 lb. of chlorine. Therefore, the facility does not exceed either 2,500 lb. federal threshold of the EPA RMP Ru"

However, threshold quantity for chlorine in the CalARP regulations is 100 lb., therefore chlorine system at the facility is subject to CalARP RMP requirements only.\n\n\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials. Chlorine is detectable with measuring devices in concentrations as low as 0.2 ppm and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60 ppm. About 1000 ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system, and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. See RMP Binder Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for chlorine.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nDel Mar Food Products maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent future releases, see Chapter 14 - Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\n3.1. Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation of the refrigeration system. Maintenance is done by the qualified in-house technicians and the refrigeration contractors. They are also trained in emergency action procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the refrigeration machinery room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in engine rooms and cold rooms. There are local visual alarms outside of each system's engine room. In System A, Refrigeration Personnel will be notified if any detecto"

Chlorine\n\n\n\nChlorine injection system is located in a locked and fenced area and access is limited to certain personnel. Cylinders are stored in bins and strapped with chains. All cylinders are under a shade. Chlorine injection system works under vacuum created by well water going through venturi ejector. If the water supply to ejector stops or vacuum is lost due to tube rupture or for any other reason, the spring-loaded inlet valve immediately closes and isolates the gas supply.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to Del Mar Food Products personnel, no incident that meets the five-year accident reporting criteria (deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage) has been occurred in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Emergency Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Emergency Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency action plan is included in RMP Binder Chapter 20.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0.
