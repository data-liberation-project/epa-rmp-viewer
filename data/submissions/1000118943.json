      "SummaryText": "40 CFR 68.155 Introduction\n\nThe USEPA's RMP regulation, 40 CFR 68, was published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, and developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental release of highly toxic or flammable\nchemicals. The RMP regulation applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process per 40 CFR 68.115.\nThe USEPA has established three (3) tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts. These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2 and 3. Program 1 is defined by a process that has had no accidental release causing offsite impacts in the past five (5) years or the nearest public receptor is beyond the distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint based on the worst-case release scenario. Program 3 applies to a process that is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) or is not classified in any of the Program 3 NAICS codes defined in 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1). Program 2 applies to processes not defined by Program 1 or 3. Therefore, the C. C. Williams Wastewater Treatment Facility processes are subject to Program 2 requirements.\n\nThe Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) operates the C. C. Williams facility located at\n1600 Yeend Street in Mobile, Alabama. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for treated wastewater,\nwith the facility storing approximately twelve (12) one-ton cylinders containing chlorine under\nnormal operating conditions. In addition to chlorine cylinders, there are six (6) one-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide, used to remove free chlorine residuals from the treated wastewater, stored on-site. As stated above, chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater and sulfur dioxide is used for the dechlorination of the wastewater effluent after chlorination and before discharge.\nThe C. C. Williams facility utilizes more than the threshold quantity of c"

The initial RMP was submitted by June 21, 1999. A five (5) year update was\nmade by Malcolm Pirnie in January 2005 updating the offsite consequence analyses determining\nwhether the parameters and assumptions used are still valid. To comply with the five (5) year update requirement in 2010, 2016, and 2021 Goodwyn Mills Cawood (GMC) reviewed the offsite consequence analyses to determine whether the parameters assumptions used are still valid and to make any necessary changes to update the RMP. In 2024 Jacobs and the Operations staff the CC Williams Facility reviewed and updated the plan.\n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe C. C. Williams facility has established procedures to ensure the integrity of the chlorination and dechlorination systems, and minimize the potential for releases. Standard protocols have been established for items such as systems operations, maintenance, training, and incident investigation. To ensure the safety of the C. C. Williams facility chlorination, the facility relies on the commitment and team effort of its employees and suppliers.\nThe C. C. Williams facility has a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of thirty (30) employees on duty at any given time, which are trained on safe operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems. Daily inspections of the areas storing and/or using chlorine and sulfur dioxide are conducted by the facility employees. The area that stores the containers is fully enclosed and is equipped with a caustic scrubber for control of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release. The caustic scrubber system is equipped with detectors that will automatically activate the scrubber system if a chlorine or sulfur dioxide concentration of three (3) parts per million or greater is present. In addition, MAWSS has installed emergency chlorine and sulfur dioxide"

The system also contains an emergency \"panic button\" located outside of the storage area to allow for operator-initiated emergency shut-off.

Williams facility will be responded to by the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency (MCEMA), whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the facility. The MCEMA would dispatch experienced HAZMAT personnel trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\nThe C. C. Williams facility stores and handles chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and is a stationary source potentially subject to 40 CFR 68. The facility has four (4) one-ton chlorine cylinders and two (2) one ton sulfur dioxide cylinders connected to the proportional feed system at all times. A header pipe supplies chlorine to the inlet side of the chlorine contact chamber. A chlorine solution is also delivered to the splitter box of the primary settling basins, a spray system to control foam near the influent and effluent of the primary biological reactors and at the intermediate pumping station. The delivery of a chlorine solution to various locations within the treatment process is to provide a more stable treatment process and guard against upsets. Similarly, a header pipe supplies sulfur dioxide only to the outlet (discharge) side of the Chlorine Contact Chamber. In addition to the two (2) sulfur dioxide cylinders and four (4) chlorine cylinders connected to the feed system(s), up to four (4) additional sulfur dioxide cylinders and eight (8) additional chlorine cylinders are stored inside the building, and are either full and waiting to be used or empty and waiting to be shipped.\n\nGaseous chlorine and/or sulf"

The chlorine solution is injected into the treated\nwastewater at the beginning of the chlorine contact chamber and the sulfur dioxide is injected at\nthe end of the chlorine contact chamber. The wastewater effluent is then discharged into Mobile\nRiver.\n\n68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Steps\n\nWorst-case and alternative case release scenarios were conducted as required for the Prevention\nProgram 2 process. Emergency response activities have been coordinated with local responders\nwhich are also required for the Prevention Program 2 process. Lastly, a program and document\nmanagement system is in place. The Prevention Program 2 process allows streamlined prevention program requirements; however, implementation of the following elements are required:\n safety information,\nhazard review,\noperating procedures,\ntraining,\n maintenance,\n compliance audits, and\nincident investigations.\n\nIn 2010, GMC, with the assistance of C. C. Williams facility management and staff, conducted a\ncompliance audit and a hazard review of the chlorine system using the \"What-If\" analysis. The\nresults of the audit and hazard review identified recommended changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the chlorine system. The results of the audit and the hazard review, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. In 2016 and 2021, this \"What If\" analysis was reviewed to ensure the findings were still valid.\n\n68.155(d) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe C. C.
