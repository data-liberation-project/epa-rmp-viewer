      "SummaryText": "This document was developed to comply with the EPA's Risk management Program II, under Section 112 \u00ae of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 CFR 68.  The disinfection process (i. e. chlorination system) is covered under this regulation at the Jefferson Parish Bridge City Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nTo meet the regulation requirements, this submission contains information on the chlorination system.\n\nThis RMP is intended to inform the public of the Bridge City WWTP's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and surrounding community.\n\nHazard Assessment\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario for the chlorination system, as well as a five year accident history for the same.  The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level the Bridge City WWTP falls.  The Bridge City WWTP is included in Risk Management Program II.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario is defined as a one ton (2,000 lb) cylinder of of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 mile duration.  This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA RMP Comp model.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 1.3 miles at the 3 ppm concnetration specified by EPA.  It should be noted that at this concnetration, a person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries.   \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) of chlorine was also modeled using RMP Comp.  An estimation of approximately 348 pounds of chlorine gas released was derived from the scenario of a vacuum regulator check unit failure.  The toxic endpoint for the ARS was determined to be 0.30 miles by RMP Comp.\n\nNo accidents have occurred, or been reported in the last five (5) years."
