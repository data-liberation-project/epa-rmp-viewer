The facility manufactures liquid Phosphate and Nitrogen based fertilizers and industrial grade Nitric Acid and Phosphoric Acid.  The Applicable NAICS codes are 325311 and 325312. The regulated substances on site that are above the threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine and oleum.  The Geismar Complex is subject to the requirements of Program 3 as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.12 due to the applicability of the NAICS code. The facility is also subject to the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) (ARS), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been performed for all the listed toxic chemicals at the facility.  The EPA RMP Comp program was used to perform the offsite consequence analysis for the facility.  The reported worst case scenarios are the toxic chemicals that could result in the release of the largest quantity of chemical and has the greatest distance to the endpoint.  An ARS was reported for each substance above the regulated threshold.  The scenarios were modeled for releases that are more probable than the worst case scenario. The scenarios reported in the RMP are presented in the following paragraphs. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe objective of the accident prevention program is to develop a proactive approach to the identification, evaluation, and prevention of chemical releases whic"

The knowledge, education, experience, and skills of selected employees is used to enhance the process hazard analysis (PHA), standard operating procedure\u00bfs (SOP\u00bfs), operator training, and the incident investigation element of these programs.

This information has been made available to all employees, including contractors, in PCS Nitrogen\u00bfs Geismar complex.  A detailed Process Safety Information plan has been developed to help employees locate these documents when needed.

Depending upon the complexity of the process system being analyzed, a variety of methodologies can be used.  PCS Nitrogen chose the \u00bfHAZOP\u00bf (Hazard and Operability Study) and \u00bfWhat if\u00bf processes.  PCS conducts a PHA on any process involving an OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substances.  The scope of each PHA includes: 1) hazards of the process, 2) identification of any previous accident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, 3) Engineering and administrative controls, 4) Consequences of failure of controls, 5) facility location, 6) human factors, 7) qualitative evaluation of the effects on all work place employees, 8) risk ranking matrix, 9) Environmental impact, 10) RMP review. The PHA team will write the analysis findings and all suggestions are be considered by management based on risk ranking. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nPCS has developed operating procedures that provide operating instructions for each part of the process from the introduction of raw material to the shipment of finished product.  The operating procedures give detailed step by step operating instructions for each part of the process during: 1) Initial startup, 2) Normal operation, 3) Temporary operation, 4) Emergency shutdown, 5) Emergency operation, 6) Normal shutdown, and 7) start-up following turnaround or emergency shutdown.   \n\nTraining Plan\n\nPCS has developed a training plan that provides a guide for the training of each employee in job related and job specific responsibilities.  Each new employee is given a comprehensive orientation-training program and a basic job specific training covering their job duties and responsibilities as they relate to both normal and"

This program outlines the entrance requirements a contractor, sales person, visitor, consultant, vendor or service company must abide by in order to perform work at the facility.  \n\nPre-Start up Review\n\nPCS conducts a pre-start up review prior to the introduction of any OSHA defined highly hazardous chemical and/or RMP regulated substance to ensure that new process facilities or modifications to original equipment, controls or safety interfaces of a covered process or covered system do not create a hazard to the facility personnel, civilian population surrounding the facility or the environment.  The review is also intended to ensure that hazards identified in the PHA have been properly addressed by design or procedural changes. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe mechanical integrity program establishes and implements the maintenance and inspection programs to ensure the mechanical integrity and reliability of fixed equipment, plant piping, rotating equipment, relief devices, instrumentation and electrical equipment within the covered processes.  The maintenance and inspection program includes and applies to pressure vessels, non or low pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping and piping components, heat exchangers, pumps, compressors, heaters, pressure safety relief valves, emergency shutdown devices, controls, electrical equipment and instrumentation.

The requirements of each of the permits can be found in the PCS Nitrogen Safety Manual section 11.0.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThis process ensures that all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than \u00bfreplacement in kind\u00bf are identified and are reviewed by qualified personnel prior to their implementation.  Except in emergencies, such changes are approved in writing prior to their implementation.  This review process ensures that additional risk are not introduced, all changes are documented, existing procedures are updated, new procedures are written as required, all process safety information is updated, and that all employees that are affected by the change are properly trained. \n\nProcess Incident Investigation\n\nThe objectives of the Process Incident Investigation management system are to: 1) Carefully analyze and document the root cause(s) of the more significant problems that are encountered.  2) Identify, track and implement the corrective actions required to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of the more significant incidents and  3) Track and trend the root cause data from these incidents to identify system problems that when corrected, can lead to dramatic improvements in performance by eliminating whole classes of problems.  \n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nPCS has implemented an Emergency Management Plan (EMP) to assure the best possible prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery in the event of an emergency.

These are as follows:\n\n1. On March 24, 2008, 2,467.5 pounds of Oleum was released from a 1 - 2\" split in the suction piping associated with the storage tank.  During this incident, one contract worker was taken to the hospital due to inhaltion of fumes.  A shelter in place was activated for the facility.  The contract worker was given a breathing treatment and released.\n\n2.  On October 7, 2004, 652 pounds of ammonia was a mechanical failure of an ammonia pump seal.  Iberville parish emergency response committee intiated a shelter in place of 840 locations within the parish.  There were no injuries reported in the community or in the facility.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the PCS Nitrogen plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP and PSM covered processes at this facility.

The EMP works in conjunction with numerous other plans including Hazardous Materials Response (HAZMAT), Hazard Communications (HAZCOM) and various site-specific plans.  The core elements of the EMP are training of personnel, roles and responsibilities, emergency action levels, emergency operations center, exercises and drills, and notification procedures.
