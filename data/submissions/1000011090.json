      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nWe at Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation (FSC) have a long-standing commitment to operating all of our processes in a manner that is safe for our workers, the community, and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and integrating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  An important part of our approach to process safety management is a risk management program (RMP) that helps us (a) manage the risks associated with using hazardous chemicals at our facility and (b) comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions: Risk Management Regulation (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at FSC.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule.\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule. \n\n\u00c2\u00b7 A prevention program to help safely maintain and operate any process that contains a sufficient quantity of RMP-listed regulated substances such that the process is covered by the RMP rule - see Section 3 of this executive summary\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 5 of this executive summary\n\nHowever, the risk management program is but one part of FSC's comprehensive safety program within which we have developed and implemented multiple levels of safeguards against accidental releases and the injuries and damage that cou"

Before using a hazardous chemical, we always consider less hazardous alternatives.  When we must use a hazardous chemical, we consider the potential for this chemical to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Preventing releases of hazardous chemicals.  When a hazardous chemical is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government codes, standards, and good practices are closely adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Limiting damage from a potential release.  Process safety is integrated into all FSC activities, with the intention of preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  However, we have trained our workforce to quickly recognize accidental releases and have organized and trained an emergency response team to quickly assess the severity of a release, to respond to stop/mitigate the release. We work closely with the Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency and the City of South Portland Fire Department to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact a release may have on our workers and the community.  \n\nOur overall safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This executive summary is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We take reasonable steps to identify potential release scenarios and to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals.  These"

We provide basic emergency training to all onsite personnel and extensive training on emergency response to our emergency response team which is organized and trained in accordance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120.  Thus, all onsite personnel have been provided with the training necessary for them to address emergency situations and execute emergency response actions as appropriate.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances Onsite\n\nFSC has one process, the integrated circuit manufacturing process, which uses three RMP-listed regulated substances, each of which is in an inventory greater than the respective threshold quantity specified in the RMP rule.  These three regulated substances are hydrogen (H2), a flammable gas; hydrogen chloride (HCL), a toxic gas; and trichlorosilane (TCS), a flammable liquid.\n\nFSC's RMP covered process consists of (1) bulk chemical delivery systems for HCL and TCS that are designed, installed, owned, operated, and maintained by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APCI), (2) a bulk chemical delivery system for H2 that is designed, installed, owned, operated, and maintained by Linde Group (Linde), and (3) processing equipment installed, owned, operated, and maintained by FSC.  \n\nTo help ensure full compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, FSC personnel provided oversight and were involved as appropriate in many APCI and Linde activities during the design and installation of the bulk chemical delivery systems, and will continue to provide oversight and work with APCI and Linde personnel as they operate and mai"

As appropriate, APCI and Linde personnel will follow FSC's procedures for activities such as (1) using other contractors onsite, (2) following safe work practices, (3) managing changes, (4) investigating onsite incidents, and (5) responding to emergencies.  FSC also plans to assess APCI's and Linde's PSM programs as a part of our future PSM/RMP compliance audits.   \n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe have always believed that employee and process safety are our highest priorities and we've integrated this belief into the ways that we do business on a daily basis.  When we increased the onsite inventories of H2, HCL, and TCS and exceeded the threshold quantities specified by OSHA's PSM regulation and EPA's RMP rule, FSC's safety and process safety programs had been upgraded and were in full compliance with both of these regulations.  Although the prevention program requirements of the RMP rule are nearly identical to those of the PSM regulation, the following sections of this executive summary briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.  Our accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n3.1. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n3.1.1 Process safety information.  FSC has established a PSM Filing System that resides in our online \"Documentum\" system.  The PSM Filing System contains all RMP-required records by either (1) containing an electronic version of the record, (2) referencing the location within the facility where the printed record exists, or (3) providing an electronic link to the record.  The PSI documentation in our PSM Filing System includes (but is not limited to) information about (a) the chemicals in our covered process, (b) the technology of our covered process (e.g., process chemistry, safe limits and the consequences of exceeding the limits, maximum chemical inventories), and (c) the equipment in our co"

We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n3.1.2. Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update the process hazard analyses performed for our covered process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  To perform a process hazard analysis, a multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Each team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The teams systematically address the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. Each team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to the appropriate personnel and necessary actions are taken to enhance the safety of the process.  Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n3.1.3. Operating procedures.  Our process engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures/specifications to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely and properly performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Steps for safely conducting activities\n\u00c2\u00b7 Applicable process operating information, such as safe operating limits and the consequences of process deviations\n\u00c2\u00b7 Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous chemical occurs\n\n3.1.4.

Written testing, observation, and/or demonstration are performed as appropriate to verify that employees understand the training material, and records of this training and the means used to verify understanding are maintained.\n\n3.1.5. Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our covered process.\n\n3.1.6. Management of change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that changes do not adversely affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with another valve of identical specifications) must be approved through the management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are informed/trained on the changes.\n\n3.1.7. Pre-startup safety review.  We recognize that a new or newly modified process is historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of any new or modified process before placing it into service to"

Compliance audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is performing thorough assessments on a regular basis.  We plan to audit our covered process at least every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  To conduct an audit, we will assemble a team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our covered process.  The team will evaluate whether our prevention program satisfies the requirements of the PSM and RMP regulations and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of an audit will be documented, recommendations will be resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\n3.1.9. Incident investigation.  We investigate all incidents that have or could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident potentially having such effects.  When an incident is reported, we assemble an investigation team and initiate the investigation as soon as possible, and at least within 48 hours of the incident. Investigation results are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n3.1.10. Employee participation.

We believe involving our workers greatly improves our efforts and helps to ensure that their safety concerns are addressed.  We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities for the covered process.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program, and have easy access to all PSM and RMP-related records.\n\n3.1.11. Hot work permits.  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with those requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the designated FSC employee reviews the completed form and the work area before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation.\n\n3.1.12. Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  Generally, training of contract personnel is accomplished by (1) explaining to the contract employer the hazards of the covered process, our safe work practices, and the applicable provisions of our emergency response procedures then (2) relying on the contract employer to provide training, verify understanding of the training, and document the training for each of their employees before the employee begins work in our facility.  On the occasions when the contract employer does not provide this training, FSC personnel will provide the training directly to contract employees, verify understanding, and create and maintain the training records.  FSC also performs periodic evaluations to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their duties under the RMP rule.\n\nIt is a"
