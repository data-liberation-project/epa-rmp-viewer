      "SummaryText": "The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as mandatory technical and safety training for all facility personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. It is the policy of LCRA to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Winchester Power Park (WPP), located in Fayette County, Texas, consists of four simple cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbines.  These turbines will be used primarily during peak electricity demand. This remote peaking facility will normally be unoccupied and will be operated by employees located at LCRA?s Lost Pines Power Park. As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the four gas-fired combustion turbines, aqueous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams. The ammonia concentration used in this process is less than 20 percent, which is below the threshold concentration in ? 68.130. However, the site also includes an ammonia based inlet air chilling system to improve turbine efficiency. The chiller will have a potential storage capacity above the threshold quantity of substances under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Administrative controls will limit the actual storage of anydrous ammonia.  A summary of the Program 2 Prevention Program is provided below.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Winchester Power Park is subject to EPA's RMP rule codified at 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart C Program 2 Prevention Program. The accidental release prevention program at Winchester includes:\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\nThe WPP has compiled and maintains safety information related to anhydrous ammonia.  These technical documents ensure that the process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe "

These documents include Material Safety Data Sheets, storage capacity in individual vessels, safe upper and lower operating limits, codes and standards used to design and build the chiller, and process equipment knowledge. This information is updated when changes are made to processes.\n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\nThe WPP has a comprehensive program to ensure that the hazards associated with the regulated process are systematically identified and controlled. This review includes operational processes and opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error that could cause an ammonia release and safeguards that will control the hazards or prevent the malfunction or error. In addition, ammonia sensors, alarms, and strobe lights are installed at key locations on the chiller to detect and report leaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe WPP maintains operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including; initial startup, routine startup and shutdown, emergency shutdown, emergency operation, routine operation, and temporary operation. The procedures also detail safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operation. The procedures are readily available to all operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified on a recurring basis.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nOperations and maintenance personnel assigned to work at the WPP are located at the Lost Pines Power Park and visit the facility periodically to check its operation.  These personnel are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia delivery, storage, operation of the ammonia chiller, and the procedures to safely operate the process. Wholesale Power Services has a separate training group specifically tasked with identifying employee training requirements, development of training program objectives, maintaining training documentation and scheduling refresher training.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nProcedures for maintaining the mechanical inte"

Maintenance procedures follow a schedule that matches the manufacturer?s recommendation or as operating experience indicates is necessary.  Maintenance personnel also receive training in the process hazards and how to correct unsafe conditions.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe risk management plan will be reviewed and certified to ensure that employees are implementing it properly.  Written records of audit findings are kept on file for at least five years.  An audit checklist has been prepared listing elements of the chiller system and documentation to be inspected, the action taken, and the date each audit finding was resolved. Safety and operations personnel knowledgeable of the chiller process will be part of the audit team assigned to walk through the facility and check relevant items.  The checklist will include the following:\n\n\n\nUp-to-date MSDS available to workers\n\nTanks, piping, pressure relief valves, compressors, emergency shut-off valves, gauges, pumps, and hoses\n\nTraining records\n\nProcedure manuals\n\nSafety equipment\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWPP will promptly investigate all incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the catastrophic release of ammonia. The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contractors as appropriate.  The investigation will be summarized in a written report, presented to plant management, and retained on site for at least five years.  The report will include incident findings, recommendations and actions taken in response to the investigation."
