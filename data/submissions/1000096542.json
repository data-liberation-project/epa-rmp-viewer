THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n\n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\n\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \n\nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \n\nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \n\nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n\n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n1.2.1.    Chemicals-Specific Operating Safety Information\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES OF THE FACILITY INCLUDE: THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LISTED ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE STORAGE AND INCINERATION PLANT SPECIFIC OPERATION PROGRAM.  THESE INCLUDE:\n\n1.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the Chemicals process. \n\nCOMPLETION OF A PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW PRIOR TO STARTUP OF THE MODIFIED CHEMICALS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   \n\nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHEMICAL RELEASES AS OUTLINED BELOW UNDER BOTH OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. \n\nSPECIFIC TRAINING IN THE PROPERTY HAZARDS, HANDLING REQUIREMENTS, AND LEAK REPAIR FOR CHEMICALS IS REQUIRED. \n\nFINALLY, THE DETAILS OF BOTH FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN ARE KEY TO THE SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEMICALS SYSTEM.\n\n1.2.3.    Facility Design\n\nTHE CONTAINERIZED CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE AREA IS LOCATED IN AN OPEN AIR AREA WAREHOUSE.  THE WAREHOUSE STORAGE AREA AND CONTROL ROOM ARE EQUIPPED WITH NATURAL AND FORCED VENTILATION SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY.  ALL BULK CHEMICAL TANKS ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS OPEN AREAS.  EACH TANK IS PADDED WITH NITROGEN TO INERT THE VAPOR SPACE.  EACH TANK IS LOCATED WITHIN SPILL CONTAINMENT.  THE SPECIAL HANDLING BUILDING HAS A FIRE MONITORS AND ALARMS.  THERE ARE FIRE DETECTORS AND EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS IN THE DETACHED STORAGE BUILDINGS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE OXIDIZER AND WATER REACTIVE CHEMICALS.",

              "Description": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCLEAN HARBORS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON BOTH OSHA'S PSM PROGRAM AND EPA'S RMP LEVEL 3 PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n\n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\n\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \n\nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \n\nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \n\nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n\n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n1.2.1.    Chemicals-Specific Operating Safety Information\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES OF THE FACILITY INCLUDE: THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LISTED ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE STORAGE AND INCINERATION PLANT SPECIFIC OPERATION PROGRAM.  THESE INCLUDE:\n\n1.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the Chemicals process. \n\nCOMPLETION OF A PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW PRIOR TO STARTUP OF THE MODIFIED CHEMICALS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   \n\nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHEMICAL RELEASES AS OUTLINED BELOW UNDER BOTH OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. \n\nSPECIFIC TRAINING IN THE PROPERTY HAZARDS, HANDLING REQUIREMENTS, AND LEAK REPAIR FOR CHEMICALS IS REQUIRED. \n\nFINALLY, THE DETAILS OF BOTH FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN ARE KEY TO THE SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEMICALS SYSTEM.\n\n1.2.3.    Facility Design\n\nTHE CONTAINERIZED CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE AREA IS LOCATED IN AN OPEN AIR AREA WAREHOUSE.  THE WAREHOUSE STORAGE AREA AND CONTROL ROOM ARE EQUIPPED WITH NATURAL AND FORCED VENTILATION SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY.  ALL BULK CHEMICAL TANKS ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS OPEN AREAS.  EACH TANK IS PADDED WITH NITROGEN TO INERT THE VAPOR SPACE.  EACH TANK IS LOCATED WITHIN SPILL CONTAINMENT.  THE SPECIAL HANDLING BUILDING HAS A FIRE MONITORS AND ALARMS.  THERE ARE FIRE DETECTORS AND EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS IN THE DETACHED STORAGE BUILDINGS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE OXIDIZER AND WATER REACTIVE CHEMICALS.\n\n",

              "Description": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCLEAN HARBORS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON BOTH OSHA'S PSM PROGRAM AND EPA'S RMP LEVEL 3 PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n\n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\n\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \n\nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \n\nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \n\nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n\n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n1.2.1.    Chemicals-Specific Operating Safety Information\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES OF THE FACILITY INCLUDE: THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LISTED ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE STORAGE AND INCINERATION PLANT SPECIFIC OPERATION PROGRAM.  THESE INCLUDE:\n\n1.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the Chemicals process. \n\nCOMPLETION OF A PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW PRIOR TO STARTUP OF THE MODIFIED CHEMICALS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   \n\nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHEMICAL RELEASES AS OUTLINED BELOW UNDER BOTH OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. \n\nSPECIFIC TRAINING IN THE PROPERTY HAZARDS, HANDLING REQUIREMENTS, AND LEAK REPAIR FOR CHEMICALS IS REQUIRED. \n\nFINALLY, THE DETAILS OF BOTH FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN ARE KEY TO THE SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEMICALS SYSTEM.\n\n1.2.3.    Facility Design\n\nTHE CONTAINERIZED CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE AREA IS LOCATED IN AN OPEN AIR AREA WAREHOUSE.  THE WAREHOUSE STORAGE AREA AND CONTROL ROOM ARE EQUIPPED WITH NATURAL AND FORCED VENTILATION SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY.  ALL BULK CHEMICAL TANKS ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS OPEN AREAS.  EACH TANK IS PADDED WITH NITROGEN TO INERT THE VAPOR SPACE.  EACH TANK IS LOCATED WITHIN SPILL CONTAINMENT.  THE SPECIAL HANDLING BUILDING HAS A FIRE MONITORS AND ALARMS.  THERE ARE FIRE DETECTORS AND EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS IN THE DETACHED STORAGE BUILDINGS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE OXIDIZER AND WATER REACTIVE CHEMICALS.\n\n",

              "Description": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCLEAN HARBORS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON BOTH OSHA'S PSM PROGRAM AND EPA'S RMP LEVEL 3 PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n\n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\n\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \n\nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \n\nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \n\nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n\n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n1.2.1.

              "Description": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCLEAN HARBORS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON BOTH OSHA'S PSM PROGRAM AND EPA'S RMP LEVEL 3 PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n\n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\n\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \n\nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \n\nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \n\nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n\n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n1.2.1.    Chemicals-Specific Operating Safety Information\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES OF THE FACILITY INCLUDE: THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LISTED ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE STORAGE AND INCINERATION PLANT SPECIFIC OPERATION PROGRAM.  THESE INCLUDE:\n\n1.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the Chemicals process. \n\nCOMPLETION OF A PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW PRIOR TO STARTUP OF THE MODIFIED CHEMICALS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   \n\nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHEMICAL RELEASES AS OUTLINED BELOW UNDER BOTH OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. \n\nSPECIFIC TRAINING IN THE PROPERTY HAZARDS, HANDLING REQUIREMENTS, AND LEAK REPAIR FOR CHEMICALS IS REQUIRED. \n\nFINALLY, THE DETAILS OF BOTH FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN ARE KEY TO THE SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEMICALS SYSTEM.\n\n1.2.3.    Facility Design\n\nTHE CONTAINERIZED CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE AREA IS LOCATED IN AN OPEN AIR AREA WAREHOUSE.  THE WAREHOUSE STORAGE AREA AND CONTROL ROOM ARE EQUIPPED WITH NATURAL AND FORCED VENTILATION SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY.  ALL BULK CHEMICAL TANKS ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS OPEN AREAS.  EACH TANK IS PADDED WITH NITROGEN TO INERT THE VAPOR SPACE.  EACH TANK IS LOCATED WITHIN SPILL CONTAINMENT.  THE SPECIAL HANDLING BUILDING HAS A FIRE MONITORS AND ALARMS.  THERE ARE FIRE DETECTORS AND EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS IN THE DETACHED STORAGE BUILDINGS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE OXIDIZER AND WATER REACTIVE CHEMICALS.\n\n",

              "Description": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCLEAN HARBORS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON BOTH OSHA'S PSM PROGRAM AND EPA'S RMP LEVEL 3 PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n\n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\n\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \n\nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \n\nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \n\nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n\n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n1.2.1.    Chemicals-Specific Operating Safety Information\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES OF THE FACILITY INCLUDE: THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LISTED ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE STORAGE AND INCINERATION PLANT SPECIFIC OPERATION PROGRAM.  THESE INCLUDE:\n\n1.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the Chemicals process. \n\nCOMPLETION OF A PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW PRIOR TO STARTUP OF THE MODIFIED CHEMICALS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   \n\nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHEMICAL RELEASES AS OUTLINED BELOW UNDER BOTH OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. \n\nSPECIFIC TRAINING IN THE PROPERTY HAZARDS, HANDLING REQUIREMENTS, AND LEAK REPAIR FOR CHEMICALS IS REQUIRED. \n\nFINALLY, THE DETAILS OF BOTH FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN ARE KEY TO THE SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEMICALS SYSTEM.\n\n1.2.3.    Facility Design\n\nTHE CONTAINERIZED CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE AREA IS LOCATED IN AN OPEN AIR AREA WAREHOUSE.  THE WAREHOUSE STORAGE AREA AND CONTROL ROOM ARE EQUIPPED WITH NATURAL AND FORCED VENTILATION SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY.  ALL BULK CHEMICAL TANKS ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS OPEN AREAS.  EACH TANK IS PADDED WITH NITROGEN TO INERT THE VAPOR SPACE.  EACH TANK IS LOCATED WITHIN SPILL CONTAINMENT.  THE SPECIAL HANDLING BUILDING HAS A FIRE MONITORS AND ALARMS.  THERE ARE FIRE DETECTORS AND EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS IN THE DETACHED STORAGE BUILDINGS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE OXIDIZER AND WATER REACTIVE CHEMICALS.\n\n",

              "Description": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nCLEAN HARBORS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON BOTH OSHAA?S PSM PROGRAM AND EPA'S RMP LEVEL 3 PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n1.2.1.    Chemicals-Specific Operating Safety Information\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES OF THE FACILITY INCLUDE: THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LISTED ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE STORAGE AND INCINERATION PLANT SPECIFIC OPERATION PROGRAM.  THESE INCLUDE:\n1.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the Chemicals process. \nCOMPLETION OF A PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW PRIOR TO STARTUP OF THE MODIFIED CHEMICALS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   \nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHEMICAL RELEASES AS OUTLINED BELOW UNDER BOTH OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. \nSPECIFIC TRAINING IN THE PROPERTY HAZARDS, HANDLING REQUIREMENTS, AND LEAK REPAIR FOR CHEMICALS IS REQUIRED. \nFINALLY, THE DETAILS OF BOTH FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN ARE KEY TO THE SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEMICALS SYSTEM.\n1.2.3.    Facility Design\nTHE CONTAINERIZED CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE AREA IS LOCATED IN AN OPEN AIR AREA WAREHOUSE.  THE WAREHOUSE STORAGE AREA AND CONTROL ROOM ARE EQUIPPED WITH NATURAL AND FORCED VENTILATION SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY.  ALL BULK CHEMICAL TANKS ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS OPEN AREAS.  EACH TANK IS PADDED WITH NITROGEN TO INERT THE VAPOR SPACE.  EACH TANK IS LOCATED WITHIN SPILL CONTAINMENT.  THE SPECIAL HANDLING BUILDING HAS A FIRE MONITORS AND ALARMS.  THERE ARE FIRE DETECTORS AND EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS IN THE DETACHED STORAGE BUILDINGS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE OXIDIZER AND WATER REACTIVE CHEMICALS.\n",

              "Description": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nCLEAN HARBORS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON BOTH OSHAA?S PSM PROGRAM AND EPA'S RMP LEVEL 3 PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n1.2.1.    Chemicals-Specific Operating Safety Information\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES OF THE FACILITY INCLUDE: THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LISTED ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE STORAGE AND INCINERATION PLANT SPECIFIC OPERATION PROGRAM.  THESE INCLUDE:\n1.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the Chemicals process. \nCOMPLETION OF A PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW PRIOR TO STARTUP OF THE MODIFIED CHEMICALS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   \nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHEMICAL RELEASES AS OUTLINED BELOW UNDER BOTH OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. \nSPECIFIC TRAINING IN THE PROPERTY HAZARDS, HANDLING REQUIREMENTS, AND LEAK REPAIR FOR CHEMICALS IS REQUIRED. \nFINALLY, THE DETAILS OF BOTH FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN ARE KEY TO THE SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEMICALS SYSTEM.\n1.2.3.    Facility Design\nTHE CONTAINERIZED CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE AREA IS LOCATED IN AN OPEN AIR AREA WAREHOUSE.  THE WAREHOUSE STORAGE AREA AND CONTROL ROOM ARE EQUIPPED WITH NATURAL AND FORCED VENTILATION SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY.  ALL BULK CHEMICAL TANKS ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS OPEN AREAS.  EACH TANK IS PADDED WITH NITROGEN TO INERT THE VAPOR SPACE.  EACH TANK IS LOCATED WITHIN SPILL CONTAINMENT.  THE SPECIAL HANDLING BUILDING HAS A FIRE MONITORS AND ALARMS.  THERE ARE FIRE DETECTORS AND EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS IN THE DETACHED STORAGE BUILDINGS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE OXIDIZER AND WATER REACTIVE CHEMICALS.\n",

              "Description": "1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCLEAN HARBORS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON BOTH OSHAA?S PSM PROGRAM AND EPA'S RMP LEVEL 3 PREVENTION PROGRAM.  THE PSM PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVELY USED SINCE 1992.  THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THE PROGRAM.  THE FIRST IS THE PLANT WIDE PROGRAM.  THE SECOND IS THE CHEMICALS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS WITHIN THE SITE PROGRAM.  CLEAN HARBOS HAS A WELL TRAINED EMPLOYEE FIRE BRIGADE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE (HAZMAT) TEAM, CONFINED SPACE RESCUE TEAM, AND MEDICAL FIRST AID TEAM.  WE CAN USE THE CITY OF EL DORADO'S FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR FIRE FIGHTING BACK-UP. \n\n1.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\nTHE FACILITY-WIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LISTED BELOW:\n\nCLEAN HARBORS HAS DETAILED PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION ON EACH OF ITS OPERATIONS THIS INCLUDES MSDS AS WELL AS WASTE PROFILES, EQUIPMENT MANUALS, P&IDS, ETC. \n\nDETAILED OPERATING PROCEDURES ARE KEPT IN A DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE SYSTEM, QSI.  QSI IS INTEGRAL INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE FOR ALL OPERATIONS ON SITE.  TRAINING IS THE BACKBONE OF EMPLOYEE KNOWLEDGE, JOB OPERATIONS AND IS ONGOING IN EACH AREA.  EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EMPHASIZES AWARENESS OF THE HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC PROPERTIES OF ALL CHEMICALS USED, OR HANDLED. \n\nMAINTENANCE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ARE USED FOR ALL OPERATIONS MAKING MECHANICAL INTEGRITY A PART OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ACCIDENTS ENSURE LEARNING FROM EACH EVENT AS WELL AS CORRECT THE ROOT CAUSE(S) OF THE INCIDENT. \n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS.  EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAFETY COMMITTEE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS; PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS TEAMS, PROCEDURE WRITING AND SAFETY CHECK PROGRAM.  ALL PSI IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES. \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY INCLUDING:  1) HOT WORK PERMITS, 2) LOCK-OUT TAG-OUT PERMITS, 3) VESSEL ENTRY PERMITS, 4) SITE SECURITY, AND 5) BREAKING INTO CHEMICAL LINES PROCEDURES. \n\nCONTRACTORS MUST MEET CLEAN HARBORS HIGH SAFETY AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF SELECTION AND ONGOING EVALUATIONS.  IN ADDITION, CLEAN HARBORS DEMANDS TRAINING OF CONTRACTORS TO THE FACILITY'S STANDARDS. \n\n1.2.    CHEMICALS SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n1.2.1.    Chemicals-Specific Operating Safety Information\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION FEATURES OF THE FACILITY INCLUDE: THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LISTED ABOVE AND THOSE OF THE STORAGE AND INCINERATION PLANT SPECIFIC OPERATION PROGRAM.  THESE INCLUDE:\n\n1.2.2.    Specific procedures for the management of the Chemicals process. \n\nCOMPLETION OF A PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW PRIOR TO STARTUP OF THE MODIFIED CHEMICALS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED.   \n\nSPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR CHEMICAL RELEASES AS OUTLINED BELOW UNDER BOTH OPERATING PROCEDURES AND IN THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  SEE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. \n\nSPECIFIC TRAINING IN THE PROPERTY HAZARDS, HANDLING REQUIREMENTS, AND LEAK REPAIR FOR CHEMICALS IS REQUIRED. \n\nFINALLY, THE DETAILS OF BOTH FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN ARE KEY TO THE SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEMICALS SYSTEM.\n\n1.2.3.    Facility Design\n\nTHE CONTAINERIZED CHEMICAL WASTE STORAGE AREA IS LOCATED IN AN OPEN AIR AREA WAREHOUSE.  THE WAREHOUSE STORAGE AREA AND CONTROL ROOM ARE EQUIPPED WITH NATURAL AND FORCED VENTILATION SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY.  ALL BULK CHEMICAL TANKS ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS OPEN AREAS.  EACH TANK IS PADDED WITH NITROGEN TO INERT THE VAPOR SPACE.  EACH TANK IS LOCATED WITHIN SPILL CONTAINMENT.  THE SPECIAL HANDLING BUILDING HAS A FIRE MONITORS AND ALARMS.  THERE ARE FIRE DETECTORS AND EXTINGUISHING SYSTEMS IN THE DETACHED STORAGE BUILDINGS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE OXIDIZER AND WATER REACTIVE CHEMICALS.\n\n",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION \n\nClean Harbors operates a hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility in an industrial area east of El Dorado.  The address is 309 American Circle, El Dorado, Union County, Arkansas.  The general commercial function of the facility is to thermally treat (incinerate) hazardous and non-regulated materials and render the incinerator residues acceptable for disposal at regulated Subtitle C landfills.  The facility also acts as a transfer station for wastes not amenable to thermal treatment.\n\nClean Harbors facility is operated by the Clean Harbor Staff.  The Facility has quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold, because of the highly variable nature of the chemicals received, Clean Harbors will use predictive filing for the RMP.  Clean Harbors has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to this Facility.  Clean Harbors facility operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n\n1.1.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS \n\nClean Harbors has a management system in place which is lead by the Vice President of Environmental Compliance as well as the Vice President of Health and Safety,  who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the Facility.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the Facility's RMP Process Safety Information.\n\n1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 \n\nClean Harbors maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  This program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-Pevention elements that are like the elements of the in-place OSHA PSM program.  RMP also has unique elements as: a management system, off-site hazards assessment, and RMP Plan submittal.  \n\n1.3.    STATIO"

Clean Harbors also employs contractors and consultants for specialized tasks.\n\nThe site is owned and operated by Clean Harbors El Dorado LLC.  The facility receives hazardous wastes in many forms and containers. The facility receives small containerized lab packs, 55 gallon drums, and totes.  The facility also receives bulk chemicals in over the road trailer vans as well as rail tankers and solids in roll off containers.\n\nThe boundaries of the RMP chemical process areas include eight processes;\n\n1.)    201&204 Drum Pumping and storage of containerized materials,\n\n2.)    Bulk liquid receiving, storage, and feed to the incinerator system,\n\n3.)    Direct Burn of both tankers and cylinders to the incinerator system, and\n\n4.)    Incinerator staging and feed system includes direct drum drops, auger shredders and direct drum pumping to the incineration system.\n\n5.)    Railcar loading for Unit 44\n\n6.)    Solid Management for Unit 44\n\n7.)    Direct Burn Bay for Unit 44\n\n8.)    All incinerator\n\nThe boundary of the RMP process ends as the waste materials combust within the rotary kiln and the secondary combustion chamber.\n\nEvery chemical received, stored, transferred and incinerated on site goes through at least two of the above processes.  Several chemicals can be processed through each of the four processes.  These processes are detailed in the Piping and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) and simplified block flow diagrams which are part of the Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the Facilities RMP Process Safety Information.\n\n1.3.1.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\nClean Harbors receives thousands of chemicals and waste streams.  Therefore, Clean Harbors is using predictive filing for regulated substances that may exceed the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  Clean Harbors has a waste approval and acceptance program that screens every waste before i"

The predictive filing inventory lists 38 RMP chemicals.  Of these, 17are flammable and 21 are toxic.  Prior to acceptance of another RMP listed chemicals above its threshold quantity, a revised RMP Plan will be submitted.  The following table of RMP chemicals includes their maximum intended inventory based on predictive filing. \n\n\n\n \n\nTABLE OF CHEMICALS AND MAXIMUM EXPECTED INVENTORY (see attachment in RMP binder)\n\n \n\n\n\n2.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the potential effects a release could have on the public and environment.  For toxic chemicals, the distance to the endpoint concentration the gas could travel was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of Chemicals was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment was conducted for each flammable and each toxic chemical.  Based on the results, two scenarios, a \"worst case\" flammable and a \"worst case\" toxic events were chosen.  Also, alternative case scenario's were conducted for each of the 38 chemicals.\n\nThe offsite consequence analyses conducted included two worst chemical release case scenarios.  The first is a worst case flammable release.  The second is a worst case toxic release scenario.  Both scenarios are defined by EPA, which states that the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released within 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure. Clean Harbors also conducted offsite consequence analysis for alternative case scenarios.  These were based on plant experience and our recent and past process hazards analysis.  \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using RMP Comp to determine the distance traveled by the chemicals released before the concentration decreases to the toxic endpo"

The toxic endpoint defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined.  To estimate the population potentially affected, USGS Topo Map, Google Earth and 2020 US census data were used.  \n\n2.1.    WORST CASE   \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case toxic scenario was performed using site specific data, EPA assumptions and criteria contained in EPA's RMP Comp Program.\n\nResults and figures of the worst case scenarios are included in the RMP report maintained onsite.\n\nDispersion modeling for the worst case flammable scenario was performed using site specific data, EPA assumptions and criteria contained in the EPA's RMP Comp Program. No offsite impacts were found within the worst case endpoint.\n\n2.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a vessel, tank or pipe system.  This failure was defined by plant experience and during the recent Process Hazards Analysis. Modeling using the EPA, RMP Comp and EPA's guidance was used. The toxic endpoint distances were determined using the following site specific variables for each of the 36 chemicals. These variables are listed in the process safety information. The residential population that would be impacted by this release is recorded in the process safety information. Receptors in this area were identified as residences, schools, recreational areas, etc.\n\n3.
