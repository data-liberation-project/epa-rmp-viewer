      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nReliant Energy Bighorn, LLC, operates the Bighorn Electric Generating Station, a nominal 580-megawatt power plant located in Primm, Nevada.  The Bighorn Electric Generating Station uses aqueous ammonia (29 percent solution) as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  As the company responsible for Bighorn Electric Generating Station, Reliant Energy Bighorn, LLC takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as it takes controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, some of the steps taken to ensure a safely operating plant, and how chemical emergencies are handled. \n\nThis document complies with Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) regulations found in the Nevada Administrative Code 459.952 to 459.95528, and the federal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.  The following provides a brief summary of the key components of the Nevada CAPP and federal RMP for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Bighorn Electric Generating Station.\n\nThe scope of this CAPP/RMP is based on discussions held with the Administering Agency (AA), the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) Bureau of Waste Management to ensure that state requirements are incorporated.  With input from the AA, the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system was identified as the only process at the Bighorn Electric Generating Station that triggers the CAPP/RMP requirements.  This process was determined to be covered by CAPP Tier B, Program Level 1 and federal RMP Program Level 1 requirements.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Bighorn Electric Generating Station accidental release prevention policy involves a"

      "SummaryText": "will consist of two Westinghouse 501FD combustion gas turbines equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction Systems (SCR) units for the control of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions. \n\nThe facility will store a 29 percent solution of aqueous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under CAPP/RMP regulations.  This aqueous ammonia storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 20,000 lbs in the CAPP/RMP regulations.  The aqueous ammonia process is categorized as a Program 1 process.  The aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Bighorn Electric Generating Station is comprised of a single storage tank, pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer where the aqueous ammonia is atomized to concentrations below 20 percent.  The tank is 30,000 gallons in volume and is equipped with pressure relief valves, temperature, pressure, and level indicators.  \n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable RMP/CAPP threshold quantities.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis was conducted using the SLAB model. SLAB is a computer based dispersion model, developed by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, which simulates the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air as well as neutrally buoyant releases. The worst-case release scenario was developed assuming that the entire contents of the aqueous ammonia storage tank are released through a failed tank or pipe into the secondary containment dike that is large enough to contain the entire volume.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions, 1.5 m/s wind speed and a stable (Pasquill F) atmospheric stability class, the ammonia cloud could travel 0.07 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.\n\nSummary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Bighorn Electric Generating Station is currently under construction.  There have been no accidental releases from the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Bighorn Electric Generating Station in th"
