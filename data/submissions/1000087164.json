      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nShamrock Foods Company strives to operate its ammonia refrigeration system without negative incidents that will affect its operation and surrounding community. The company will achieve this by ensuring the system design is by relevant standards and codes, and operated and maintained by competent service professionals or company personnel.\n\n\n\nTo help prevent and mitigate the results of negative incidents Shamrock implemented results of mechanical integrity audits, process hazard analysis, local fire department involvement, and installation by a licensed contractor. The Shamrock site incorporated specific emergency response actions into emergency action plans to account for the ammonia refrigeration system. The company referenced the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for developing actions in case of a negative incident, and documented emergency response actions on the exterior of the ammonia refrigeration building, within the process safety management program, and within emergency response checklists.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES USED\n\nShamrock Foods Company occupies a warehouse type building for cold storage of dairy related products. Shamrock uses an ammonia refrigeration system to maintain a cold dock, cooler, and freezer for receiving, storing, and shipping the food products.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system operates with approximately 17,000 pounds of ammonia, anhydrous. If a system operates at greater than 10,000 pounds, a company is responsible for developing a Process Safety Management program under OSHA and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These programs and plans help a company manage their risk of exposure to internal employees and the community.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system and does not consume or emit ammonia. The process is such t"

An ammonia refrigeration system will not have air emissions or water discharges from the process when the system is operated and maintained appropriately. \n\n\n\nGENERAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system received updates in accordance with current codes and standards in 2020. The local fire department conducted an inspection of the facility during the 2020. In 2018 the facility updated process and system safeguards (emergency ventilation) to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. A professional engineer specializing in ammonia refrigeration systems completed ultrasonic testing on the dump trap/oil pots and a refrigeration contractor performed a mechanical integrity review on the ammonia refrigeration system in 2017.\n\n\n\nThe company updated the ammonia refrigeration system in 2018 by removing piping and equipment that no longer served a purpose for the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe company utilizes two continuous/emergency flow ventilation fans. Which are capable of providing adequate continuous and emergency ventilation in compliance with the 2012 International Mechanical Code (IMC) and ANSI/IIAR-2 requirements.\n\n\n\nProcess equipment operates within design limits and is in good clean condition.  There is not excessive dirt, scale, or ice built up around the system. The company secured equipment so it does not exhibit excessive vibration.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls such as a Process Safety Management Program and Operating Procedures are in place to help prevent and mitigate releases. OSHA defines required Process Safety Management information and includes items like:\n\n-    Gathering and communicating process chemical information\n\n-    Documenting process technology information\n\n-    Documenting process equipment information\n\n-    Conducting process hazard analysis\n\n-    Ensuring and maintaining mechanical integrity of the system\n\n-    Develop"

The local fire engine company has not communicated any response actions that they provided. Shamrock is not aware of additional factual data regarding any previous incidents.\n\n\n\nShamrock made improvements to the ammonia refrigeration system. The company has no incidents to report since they assumed ownership.\n\n\n\nELEMENTS OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe key elements to the company's emergency response program are:\n\n-    Emergency instructions, phone numbers, and direct contacts posted on the exterior of the ammonia refrigeration building.\n\n-    Emergency Phone List incorporated into the PSM program listing Shamrock emergency contacts, service contractor contacts, utility contacts, and local \n\n        hospitals and occupational healthcare centers.\n\n-    Emergency Response Checklists describing evacuation and dealing with several common emergency events.\n\n-    The company designed the ammonia refrigeration system to shut down in the event that the ammonia detection system activates, and the system will activate \n\n        emergency exhaust, and notify the local fire department.\n\n\n\nELEMENTS OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nShamrock implemented several upgrades to the ammonia refrigeration system in 2018.
