      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company facility located in Taft, California is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Release [40 CFR 68] because its Acrolein production, storage and loading process contains more than the threshold quantities of acrolein (CAS No. 107-02-8) and propylene (CAS No. 115-07-1). Acrolein is a toxic and flammable substance which is a liquid at ambient temperatures.  Propylene is a flammable substance which is a gas at ambient conditions, but is carefully stored under pressure as a liquid at the Taft Manufacturing Company.\n\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company uses air, propylene, and steam to produce specification-grade acrolein.  The raw materials are feed into a reactor with a catalyst that converts the propylene to acrolein.  The acrolein is separated from the other reactant by-products and residues in a series of quench columns, a stripper, and two distillation columns.  The finished product acrolein is collected in three 1,000 gallon process tanks and ultimately transferred into and stored in dedicated ISO-containers on flatbed railcars for repackaging.\n\n\n\nA maximum inventory of 260,000 lbs. of propylene can be on site at any one time with up to 130,000 lbs. of propylene per railcar storage vessel. The process generates approximately 700 lbs./hr. of acrolein, with up to 30,000 lbs. present in a single ISO-container and a total of twelve (12) ISO - containers on site.\n\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company utilizes standard operating procedures, training, administrative and engineering controls, and other safety practices to assure that acrolein and propylene are handled in a safe manner. Details of the facility's extensive prevention program are summarized in Section 3.0.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Facilities\n\nWe at the Taft Manufacturing Company are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a "

It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release and can call on assistance from the Kern County Fire Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses the manufacturing and transfer of acrolein, a chemical used in oilfield and agricultural applications, into bulk storage containers and then into transfer and shipping/dispenser containers.  We also rework and service the containers.  The acrolein is used as a pesticide and algaecide for crop protection and a sulfide scavenger, biocide, and corrosion inhibitor in oil field applications. \n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA as well as the requirements of Ca. Code of Regulations , Title 19, Public Safety, Div. 2, Off. Of Emergence Service, Chapter 4.5 Ca. Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information- The Taft Manufacturing Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses - Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to"
