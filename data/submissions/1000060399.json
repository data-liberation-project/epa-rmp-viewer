      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company facility located in Taft, California is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Release [40 CFR 68] because its Acrolein production, storage and loading process contains more than the threshold quantities of acrolein (CAS No. 107-02-8) and propylene (CAS No. 115-07-1). Acrolein is a toxic and flammable substance which is a liquid at ambient temperatures.  Propylene is a flammable substance which is a gas at ambient conditions, but is carefully stored under pressure as a liquid at the Taft Manufacturing Company.\n\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company uses air, propylene, and steam to produce specification-grade acrolein.  The raw materials are feed into a reactor with a catalyst that converts the propylene to acrolein.  The acrolein is separated from the other reactant by-products and residues in a series of quench columns, a stripper, and two distillation columns.  The finished product acrolein is collected in three 1,000 gallon process tanks and ultimately transferred into and stored in dedicated ISO-containers on flatbed railcars for repackaging.\n\n\n\nA maximum inventory of 260,000 lbs. of propylene can be on site at any one time with up to 130,000 lbs. of propylene per railcar storage vessel. The process generates approximately 700 lbs./hr. of acrolein, with up to 30,000 lbs. present in a single ISO-container and a total of twelve (12) ISO - containers on site.\n\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company utilizes standard operating procedures, training, administrative and engineering controls, and other safety practices to assure that acrolein and propylene are handled in a safe manner. Details of the facility's extensive prevention program are summarized in Section 3.0.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Facilities\n\nWe at the Taft Manufacturing Company are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a "

It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release and can call on assistance from the Kern County Fire Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses the manufacturing and transfer of acrolein, a chemical used in oilfield and agricultural applications, into bulk storage containers and then into transfer and shipping/dispenser containers.  We also rework and service the containers.  The acrolein is used as a pesticide and algaecide for crop protection and a sulfide scavenger, biocide, and corrosion inhibitor in oil field applications. \n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA as well as the requirements of Ca. Code of Regulations , Title 19, Public Safety, Div. 2, Off. Of Emergence Service, Chapter 4.5 Ca. Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information- The Taft Manufacturing Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses - Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP, WHAT-IF, and CHECKLIST methods.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, plant operations, and/or maintenance.  Employees are involved in making suggestions to improve the safety and environmental operation of their work environment.  The analyses are reviewed and revalidated at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Taft Manufacturing Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address normal operations, including startup, shutdown, and emergency operations.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining- The Taft Manufacturing Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity- The Taft Manufacturing Company carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  The Taft Manufacturing Company also participates in a quarterly leak detection and repair program.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - Written procedures are in place at the Taft Manufacturing Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

The completed management of change form shall be approved by management before any changed is put to service.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Taft Manufacturing Company.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits- The Baker Hughes Corporation supports the Taft Manufacturing Company by conducting internal audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits of RMP covered processes are conducted at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are initiated in a safe and prompt manner.  In addition Process Safety Management audits are conducted every 3 years.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation- The Taft Manufacturing Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation- The Taft Manufacturing Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention requires a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Taft Manufacturing Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and safety data sheet (SDS) of all chemicals on-site is made available upon request. \n\nIn addition to the activities outlined above, we recognize the hazard to operations represented to many operations in California by earthquakes by conducting periodic documented structural integrity inspections of equipment used in acrolein storage and transfer as well as all other piping systems, coupling, and valves on site.  All piping and transfer systems were constructed in compliance state and federal codes and are so maintained.  \n\n\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company has had good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.
