Affected employees are trained regularly in handling hazardous substances, operating safe equipment and in emergency response actions.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nSince this operation was installed in 2003, there has not been an incident or accident associated with this system.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Action:\r\nThe facility has developed and implemented a detailed Contingency and Emergency Response Program which includes emergency and incident notification reporting, emergency health care, emergency response actions, training requirements, and incident prevention program.  The facility's Contingency Plan has been coordinated with the Rockland Fire Department, our LEPC.  Copies of the plan have been submitted to the Rockland Fire Department, Rockland Police Department, Rockland Board of Health, Rockland Town Administrator, Fire Departments of surrounding towns, local hospital and emergency care giver and MA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).\r\n\r\nSafety Improvements:\r\nITW Polymers Sealants NA believes that the processes storing and using the regulated substances are operated and maintained in a safe manner.  Improving safety is an on-going practice and is continously addressed by management, the personnel and the EHS Department. ITW Polymers Sealants NA plans to take all necessary, realistic, technically and economically feasible actions to improve safety."

RMP default data was selected and the EPA's RMP*COMP software was used for determining the impact distance.  The two scenarios were shown to have off-site impacts.\r\nBoth scenarios are extremely unlikely to actually occur.  The tanks are designed to withstand a maximum pressure of 250 psi, but are operated at much lower pressures (5-70 psi).  Also the existing safety practices at the facility will help minimize any incidents, the tanks will be regularly inspected and tested for mechanical integrity (according to manufacturer's recommendations).  Rockland, Massachusetts is not a known area for earthquakes or tornado activity.  More detail about the safety systems is provided in the submission.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario:\r\nThe following alternative release scenarios (ARS) were evaluated for this process based on EPA guidance:\r\nTransfer hose releases dues to splits or sudden hose uncoupling\r\nVessel overfilling and spill, or venting through relief valves or rupture disks\r\nITW Polymers Sealants NA believes these scenarios are more likely than the worst case scenario, though still highly unlikely due to the specification of the equipment and on-going safety practices.  Similar to the WCS, the maximum fill capacity of each tank (85%) was considered, as well as  the secondary containment dike for the isopentane.  The total contents were assumed to be released during these scenarios.  RMP default  meteorological data was selected, and the EPA's RMP*COMP software was used for determining off-site impact.  \r\n\r\nAccident Prevention Program:\r\nITW Polymers Sealants NA has developed and implemented a Contingency and Emergency Response Program which addresses the processes using hazardous substances.  Safe operating procedures are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary.  All process equipment is inspec"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description:\r\nITW Polymers Sealants North America operates an adhesive manufacturing facility located in Rockland, Massachusetts.  The facility building houses manufacturing, office and warehouse space.  Other structures on the side include 13 above ground solvent storage tanks, 3 above ground propellant tanks, all associated piping, and a gas house. The processes which trigger applicability to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) are the 3 above ground flammable propellant storage tanks associated with the pressurized container filling operation.  The vicinity of the area is light commercial/industrial area.\r\n\r\nMajor change since last submission - Corporate ITW grouped several ITW units into one division, ITW Polymers Sealants North America.  All operations at the Rockland remain the same, the change was in name only.  ITW TACC is now known as ITW Polymers Sealants North America.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances:\r\nBased on a comprehensive review, ITW Polymers Sealants North America has identified the following substances regulated by the US EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP):  1) Flammable Mixture (propane/isobutane), 2) Dimethyl Ether (DME), and 3) Isopentane. The provisions of the RMP therefore apply to the processes using these regulated substances.  The flammable mixture (isobutane/propane blend), DME and isopentane are used in manufacturing pressurized spray adhesives and are stored in aboveground, horizontal tanks with capacities of 9,200 gallons, 9,200 gallons and 6,000 gallons, respectively.  Controls on the tanks allow for maximum filling to 85% of capacity.\r\n\r\nThese three substances are also regulated under Process Safety Management (PSM).  ITW Polymers Sealants NA has a combined RMP/PSM pogram.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\r\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) was based on the catastrophic rupture of either of the largest vessels in each process, the DME propellant storage tank and the Flammable Mixture propellant storage tank  As per the RMP, the entire"
