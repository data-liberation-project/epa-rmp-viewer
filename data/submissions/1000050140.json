Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nWe at the Premier Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  It is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass Carrot processing and storage.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  Substance one is Chlorine (Gas), which is used for water treatment in our plant.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine (Gas) at our facility is 20,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \r\n\r\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP calculation program.\r\n\r\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility has been upgraded and improved in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Informatio"
