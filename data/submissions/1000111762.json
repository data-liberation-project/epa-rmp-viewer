The Facility Policy\n             The management and employees of Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental chemical releases.  The facility has a safety program in place and prevention check-lists to deter any possible equipment failures.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work closely with the local authorities and the local fire department to mitigate any release and to reduce the impact to the local people and environment.\n\n2.)   The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n             Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. is primarily a retail business for the sale of pesticides, fertilizers, and seeds to the farmer.  The plant also buys grain from the farmer and stores and/or sells grain to other terminals.\n             Anhydrous Ammonia is the regulated substance handled at Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc.  It is received by truck, stored, and sold to farmers for crop production nutrients.\n             The maximum quantity stored of anhydrous ammonia at Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. would be 372,000 pounds.  This would be stored in the two inter-connected 12,000 gallon storage tanks, two 500 gallon applicators, and fifty-eight  nurse tanks at an administrative filling limit of 85% of design capacity.  This maximum amount would generally apply during the season from May through June.  The quantity stored during the rest of the year could vary from 0 to the maximum of 210,000 pounds, depending upon inventory availability, early fill programs, or product pricing.\n\n3.)   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n             Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. follows, to the best of their knowledge, the safety and storage requirements"
