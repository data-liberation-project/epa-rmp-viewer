There are three one-ton caontainers of CL2 and SO2 at this location. There is only a single one-ton container in use  of CL2 and SO2 at any given time. The other containers are on standy-by, or are backup containers only. The supply is automatically switched over to the stand-by tank when the operating take becomes empty.\n\nWhen a container is emptied another container is ordered. This is offloaded by the vendor to the location by use of a hoist and rail system. The container is then placed on backup status until needed. \n\nThere are two fulltime operators that are responsible for daily inspectons of this facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nAccidental release preventions is accomplished by careful attention to unloading containers, installing regulators, and connecting to the injection system. The emergency response will be repair ( or contact vendor for repair) any source of release, alert the local emergency response teams, and evacuate adjacent receptors as required. \n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\nThe safety procedures in force at the sites are working as demonstrated by the fact there has been no release of CL2 or SO2 at this site within the last five years."
