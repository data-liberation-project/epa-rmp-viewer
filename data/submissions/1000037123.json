The facility is in a light industrial area on the south by south west side of town.  The latitude is 32 47' 46'' and longitude -97 13' 48''.  The facility has an NAICS code of 42269 which identifies it as a chemical distributor and as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.10(b)(2) is a Program 2 facility.  The facility has approximately twenty two employees with as many as sixteen being on the site at any given time.  The city has an approximate population 7,801 based on the 2010 consensus.  Within 0.4 miles east northeast of the facility is a mass transit train station.  This transient population can add an additional 500 to 750 between the hours of 0530 to 0900 hours in the morning and 1600 to 1830 hours in the evening.  The rail line runs approximately 0.01 miles to the North of the facility.  Highway 121 is approximately 0.05 miles to the north of the facility and has heavy traffic during rush hour.  To the north and to the northwest lies a dense residential area approximately 0.12 miles from the facility. Industrial businesses are located to the east and to the south east of the facility.  The industrial park is the second largest in Tarrant County.  Day time population of the industrial park can range from 250 to 1,000 employees depending on occupancy and time of day.  During the evening hours these businesses are closed and the population is <10 depending on security guards hired by the independent businesses.\r\nThe facility is approximately 35,000 square feet of warehouse storage space located on 2.3 acres. The property is secured by an eight foot chain link fence on three of the four sides of the property.  One toxic chemical was identified under EPA's CAA 112 (r), 40 CFR Part 68.130 tables 1 and 2. Using 40 CFR Part 68.130 tables 3 and 4, no flammable chemicals as described by the type and/or reportable quantity were identified"

Facility continuing education programs provide employees with, but not limited to, mitigation response roles, chemical identification, evacuation procedures, hazardous release communication system, and facility security.  These efforts ensure that all facility employees will respond in a unified and coordinated response effort in the event of a chemical release.  The facility is within the Richland Hills, TX, fire department (RHFD) jurisdiction.  Additionally, RHFD is a member of an eight city combined hazmat response team.  The hazmat truck and hazmat coordinator are stationed at the North Richland Hills, TX, fire department (NRHFD).  Local response time is <3 minutes.  The unified hazmat response team response time is <8 minutes.  The hazmat team has the equipment and personal training to conduct basic air and water sampling, mitigate active leaks, conduct shelter in place and/or evacuate business and/or residence, and dike, dam, and/or divert the release.  Vapor and/or fire suppression could also be provided by the utilization of a 100 foot aerial ladder with two water nozzles and a 75 foot aerial ladder with a water nozzle.  Additional assistance can be requested from the Environmental Protection Agency Region 6 (EPAR6) located in Dallas, TX, and/or Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Emergency Response Regional Team stationed in Ft. Worth, TX. Regularly scheduled fire department building inspections ensure the facility is in compliance with local fire code requirements.\r\nThe facility is inspected yearly by the local fire department for national and local fire code enforcement.

Facility employees participate in mock exercises to maintain skills necessary to mitigate and manage any potential releases at the facility.  Employees are also required to participate in a variety of on-line or class room safety training courses to minimize accidents and work related injuries.  Employees participate in yearly reviews of hazards communication program training and site security programs.  These programs address procedures for illegal entry into the facility, notification process in the event of an accidental or man-made release, and basic mitigation procedures for nuisance spills.\r\nThe facility EHS manager conducts spot inspections to ensure regulatory compliance.   Compliance issues are brought to the attention of the EHS and facility manager and addressed in a timely manner.  Regulatory guidance is also provided to the facility in matters of regulatory reporting, waste management, and any potential training that would better prepare employees for an emergency response by web based email consultation services.  The facility voluntarily provides reporting documents to the EPA, TCEQ, DEA, and DHS.  The facility is also a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors and currently complies with NACD's recommendations of good chemical stewardship."
