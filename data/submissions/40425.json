This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\nresponse efforts with the Lakefield Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\nexpertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in two 18,000-gallon tanks, three 1,450-gallon nurse tanks, sixteen 1,140-gallon\nnurse tanks, and twenty-four 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Lakefield, Minnesota (Figure\n1).  The maximum amount stored is 70,201.5 gallons (361,256.9 pounds) at  85% standard maximum\nstorage capacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel\nat our facility contains 78,733.8 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3.
