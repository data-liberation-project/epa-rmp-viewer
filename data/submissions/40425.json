Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Co-op Ag Center in Lakefield, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\nresponse efforts with the Lakefield Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\nexpertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in two 18,000-gallon tanks, three 1,450-gallon nurse tanks, sixteen 1,140-gallon\nnurse tanks, and twenty-four 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Lakefield, Minnesota (Figure\n1).  The maximum amount stored is 70,201.5 gallons (361,256.9 pounds) at  85% standard maximum\nstorage capacity including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel\nat our facility contains 78,733.8 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3.

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\nmanner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nCo-op Ag Center maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered\nprocesses are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nCo-op Ag Center has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCo-op Ag Center conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\noperation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in\nmaintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Co-op Ag Center to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\nof the modification and of"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\nequipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCo-op Ag Center conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's\nprovisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCo-op Ag Center truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team\neffort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information\nresulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nCo-op Ag Center has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. \nDue to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this\nperiod.\n\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\nCo-op Ag Center maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of\nhazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and\nmedical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Co-op Ag Center will\ncontact local emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A).
