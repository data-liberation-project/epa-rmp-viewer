Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Dow Chemical, Allyn's Point Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. However, if a release were to occur, our employees are trained in emergency response to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  In addition, our emergency response plan is coordinated with Gales Ferry, CT Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Plastics Manufacturing..  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] and Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-].  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  1,3-Butadiene is used for manufacturing liquid latex emulsion polymer.  Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] is used for for manufacturing ABS plastic pellets.  Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] is used for manufacturing of polystyrene foam housing insulation.                                   \n\nThe maximum inventory of 1,3-Butadiene at our facility is 1050000.00 lb. while Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] and Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-] are present at our facility in quantities of 641000.00 lb. and 220000.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.

For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] and ALOHA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Magnum.  In this scenario 176,000 lb. of Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] is spilled.  The toxic liquid spill is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The ALOHA model limits the duration of the release to 60 minutes.  86853 lb. of Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] is estimated to evaporate over 60 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 2.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] involves a release from Magnum.  The scenario involves the spill of 465000 lb. of Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile]. Passive mitigation controls such as a dike are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of limiting the surface area of the spill to 3036 square feet.  The ALOHA model limits the duration of the release to 60 minutes.  4108 lb. of Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] is estimated to evaporate over 60 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/L of Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] is 0.5 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Latex.  In this scenario 1050000 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explos"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally accepted good design practices and engineering standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDow Chemical, Allyn's Point Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes, including material safety data sheets, equipment specifications, and reactive chemicals tests.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  Methodologies used to carry out these analyses are Checklist, HAZOP, Dow Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazard Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 06/22/1998.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safel"

Five-year Accident History\nDow Chemical, Allyn's Point Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, we have had only one accidental release as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances during this period.\n\nThere has been only one accidental release of a regulated substance from our facility within the last 5 years.  This release took place on 04/05/1999 and involved 9200 lb. of Hydrogen chloride (anhydrous) [Hydrochloric acid] and 9600 lb. of Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (conc. 50% or greater) [Hydrofluoric acid].  We do not store these hazardous substances on our site.  The hazardous substances were combustion products from a fire that consumed extruded polystyrene foam insulation stored at our site.  The fire was caused by a brush fire that spread from land bordering our site.  No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident.  There was no damage to property offsite.  As a precaution, the community emergency response of shelter-in-place was initiated.  Onsite, there were no deaths or injuries.  There was some onsite property damage.  \n\n\n6.
