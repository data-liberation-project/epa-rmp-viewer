      "SummaryText": "Carlisle Regional Distribution Center\nA Risk management Plan Has been implemented at the Carlisle facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility is located at 597 Alexander Spring Rd., Carlisle, PA  17013 (Cumberland County).The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products, packaged in aerosol cans for retail sale, and manufactured by the site owner, Unilever Co. The operator at the site is Exel, Inc., a subsidiary of Deutshe Post Ag, Bonn, Germany.\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations. Specifically the components consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends.The maximum projected quantities (cases) of aerosol products stored in the warehouse and product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process.\n \nThe worst case scenario performed, based on EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance indicates that the distance to the 1psi overpressure endpoint will not extend beyond warehouse property. No offsite receptors are impacted. There have also been no prior accidents at the facility resulting in any offsite environmental impacts. \nEmergency response activities at the Carlisle facility are coordinated with the Cumberland County LEPC and the Union Fire Company of Carlisle."
