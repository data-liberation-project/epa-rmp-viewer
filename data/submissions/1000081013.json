      "SummaryText": "Platte Chemical Company is a toll manufacturer of liquid crop protection chemicals.  The company is part of United Agri Products.  The Greenville, MS facility formulates and packages emulsifiable concentrates and liquid suspension concentrates.  These formulations include insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides.\n\n\n\nPlatte Chemicals is subject to the Risk Managment Planning requirements due to the quantity of Isoproplyamine onsite.  \n\n\n\nThe Platte Chemical Company has a documented emergency response plan which includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of events including fire, release, and inclement weather.  The plan describes actions which result in safe response for company employees as well as notification of the surrounding community.  A copy of the plan has been given to the Washington County LEPC and the Greenville Fire Department.\n\n\n\nDuring the past 5 years there have been no RMP-defined accidental at the Greenville location.  The RMP includes one flammable worst case scenario and one flammable alternative for each chemical.  The worst case scenario is catastrophic failure of a full tank of a chemical resulting in fire.  A more likely scenairo for a chemical is a hole in the tank.  \n\n\n\nThe Platte Chemical Company employs all of the techniques for a comprehensive prevention and response program including process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity, operating procedures, management of change, contractor and visitor programs, and  employee training and participation programs.  \n\n\n\n"
