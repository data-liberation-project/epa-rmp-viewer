The ICP addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, Valero Linden has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  We work with the local fire department and emergency responders to ensure the proper execution of our plan.  The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe Valero Linden facility has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction and process safety requirements.  Valero Linden will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety at the facility.  The 2012 PHA listed reccomendations for the covered processes.

      "SummaryText": "This Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Valero Renewable Fuels Company, LLC (Valero Linden) dry mill ethanol production facility located in Linden, Indiana.  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.   The Valero Linden ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, and denaturant (natural gasoline), a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantities.   This RMP submittal is for the 5-year resubmission period.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\nValero Linden is committed to protecting the environment and operating facilities in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public.  Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases.  Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance, inspections and testing of the equipment (e.g., shutoffs, alarms, probes, mechanical integrity, etc.), and the training of our personnel, Valero Linden has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.  \r\n\r\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.) as well as any potentially affected neighbors."
