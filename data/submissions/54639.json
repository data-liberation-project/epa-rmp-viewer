With input from the CUPA, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) aqueous ammonia storage and handling system has been identified as the only process at the facility which triggers the CalARP RMP requirements.  This process was determined to be covered by Prevention Program 2 requirements.\n\nOn March 31, 2004, the amendment to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) under the Clean Air Act Section 112 \u00ae (7) was signed. The amendment:\n\n* Requires a correction to reportable information on chemical accidents be added to the RMP within six (6) months of the date of the accident;\n\n* Requires that changes to emergency contact information be corrected within one (1) month;\n\n* Removes the requirement to include a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the RMP executive summary; and\n\n* Adds three (3) RMP data elements.\n\nEPA also amended the RMP*Submit format to expand the list of possible accident causes to include uncontrolled chemical reactions.  As part of this rulemaking, EPA also clarified that the five (5) year deadline for updating RMPs that were originally filed early (i.e., submitted before June 21, 1999), is June 21, 2004, with subsequent updates due every five (5) years thereafter.  This amendment became effective on April 9, 2004 when it was published in the Federal Register.  \n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of RRI E"

To achieve this end, RRI strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \n\nRRI implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\nThe Mandalay Generating Station is located at 393 North Harbor Boulevard in Oxnard, California at the western margin of the Oxnard Plain adjacent to the Pacific Ocean and approximately 60 miles west of Los Angeles, California (coordinates 34\u00b0 12\u00bf 26\u00bf north, 119\u00b0 15\u00bf 4\u00bf west).  The elevation of the facility is approximately 15 feet above sea level.  The nearest earthquake fault zones are the Malibu Coast-Santa Monica-Hollywood-Raymond Fault Zone 22 miles southeast of the site; the Oak Ridge Fault 3 miles north of the site; and the Ventura Fault 5 miles north of the site.\n\nThe station is located between a residential zone to the south (Oxnard Shores) and McGrath State Beach to the north. The main area covers approximately 60 acres and is bounded Harbor Boulevard on the east and by the Pacific Ocean on the west.  Appendix A contains site location/vicinity and overview maps.\n\nThe Mandalay Generating Station consists of two gas-fired steam turbine units, each rated at 215 MW (1990 mmBTU/hr), and one 130 MW (2510 mmBTU/hr) gas turbine peaking unit.

Management system components for this facility include:\n\n* Identification of the qualified person/position with responsibility for coordinating the RMP\n\n* Organizational chart showing the positions with tasks involving the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system\n\n* Roles and responsibilities of positions at the facility\n\n\n1.8  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFollowing two (2) safety improvements made in 2004 (gas detection alarm upgrades, extra seismic restraints on pipes), there were no current action items identified during the 2009 Hazard Review \u00bfwhat-if\u00bf scenarios analysis.\n\nRRI enforces continuous improvements to safety and health and tracks training to ensure commitment to safe working practices and the protection of the employees and the environment.  RRI works closely with the CUPA to ensure that all requirements are addressed.\n1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPursuant to the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.1 through 68.220 and Chapter 6.95, Article 2 of the California Health & Safety Code \u00a7"

      "SummaryText": "25531 through \u00a725543.3, this federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) is implemented as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this RMP is based on the guidance of the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), the city of Oxnard Fire Department, to ensure that all contemporary issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.  With input from the CUPA, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) aqueous ammonia storage and handling system has been identified as the only process at the facility which triggers the CalARP RMP requirements.  This process was determined to be covered by Prevention Program 2 requirements.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2004, the amendment to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) under the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r) (7) was signed. The amendment:\r\n\r\n* Requires a correction to reportable information on chemical accidents be added to the RMP within six (6) months of the date of the accident;\r\n\r\n* Requires that changes to emergency contact information be corrected within one (1) month;\r\n\r\n* Removes the requirement to include a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the RMP executive summary; and\r\n\r\n* Adds three (3) RMP data elements.\r\n\r\nEPA also amended the RMP*Submit format to expand the list of possible accident causes to include uncontrolled chemical reactions.  As part of this rulemaking, EPA also clarified that the five (5) year deadline for updating RMPs that were originally filed early (i.e., submitted before June 21, 1999), is June 21, 2004, with subsequent updates due every five (5) years thereafter.  This amendment became effective on April 9, 2004 when it was published in the Federal Register.  \r\n\r\n\r\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of RRI Energy (RRI) that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any harm that may occur as a result of its operations.
