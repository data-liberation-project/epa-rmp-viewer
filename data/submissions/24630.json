By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\n\nPolicies\n\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n* We produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\n* We assist our customers to use our products safely and in environmentally sound manner.  We provide\n   them with information on correct handlng of our products.\n* We minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation,  \n   marketing and use of our products.\n* Economic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\n* An important contribution to \"Sustainable Development\" is our involvement in the \"Responsible Care\" \n   initiative worldwide.

Our goals are to promote and \n   strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Beaumont Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and \nprocedures.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Beaumont Site produces several brands of trade name herbicides.  These include Banvel(R), Clarity(R), Distinct(R), and Frontier(R), as well as a variety of other formulations, which are used in the farm sector to enhance growth, to eliminate weeds, and to improve the yield in general.  Chlorine, dimethylamine, methyl chloride, and methyl chloroformate are used  to produce some of these products.\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n* Toxic gas release of chlorine with off-site impacts resulting from rupture of a chlorine railcar.\n\n* Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of dimethylamine from a railcar with off-site impacts.\n\n\nAlternative\n\n* Vessel leak of chlorine with minimal off-site impact.  Active mitigation that is available but not accounted \n   for in determining the off-site impact includes firewater sprays to limit gas evolution as well as a flow-\n   limiting valve.\n\n* Vessel leak of methyl chloride with no off-site impact.  Passive mitigation considered is a dike and active \n   mitigation includes a foam sprinkler system.\n\n* Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of dimethylamine with minimal off-site impact.  Active \n   mitigation consists of diluting anhydrous dimethylamine with water upon receiving it, which drastically\n   reduces its flammability.\n\n*  A pipe leak of methyl chloroformate with minimal off-site impact.

Extensive efforts have been made to avoid situations that could provide the conditions which could lead to the release of any chemical used on site.  These efforts include (1)  HAZOP or Zurich analysis of all new or modified systems, (2)  Pre-startup safety reviews, and (3)  Specific operating procedures for normal conditions as well as emergency situations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the local emergency planning commission.  The site is a member of the Sabine Area Chiefs Association, which is a mutual aid group, and assists the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission.  The site maintains a complete fire fighting facility manned by volunteer employees who receive extensive training.
