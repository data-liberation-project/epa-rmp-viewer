We are proud of our safety record and strive to ensure that we design and operate our facility so that hazards are minimized and risks controlled.\n\nWe use a refrigeration process to maintain appropriate temperatures at critical control points in our operation.  Anhydrous ammonia, the refrigerant in this process, is regulated under 40CFR part 68.  We have specific programs and practices in place for controlling this process to ensure that a harmful release of this substance does not occur.  These programs and practices include:\n\n- Following recognized good engineering practices in the design, installation and operation of our refrigeration equipment and ensuring this equipment meets OSHA standards and ASME codes.\n- Continually assessing hazards and safeguards in our process so we can minimize risks.\n- Using release prevention practices that have been recognized as effective by Federal and State experts.\n- Maintaining preparedness and contingency plans for responding to any emergency that may occur and coordinating these plans with local response agencies.\n\nUsing methods and guidelines approved by OSHA and EPA, we have determined that the worst-case release of ammonia from our refrigeration process is represented by a release of approximately 7,700 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia from the Receiver located inside our buildings.  Although very unlikely to occur, we have determined, using techniques and parameters specified by EPA, that such a release could affect a portion of a circular area having a radius of 0.8 miles surrounding our site.  This area includes neighboring industrial sites and residences with a total population of 310 people (1990 US Census) and a portion of a State Wildlife Management Area.  Under controlled operating conditions, this distance"

      "SummaryText": " is reduced to 0.5 miles radius, which includes a population of 130 people. \n\nOur release prevention program focuses on preventing hazardous releases of anhydrous ammonia.  We use equipment and follow management practices that are consistent with recognized good engineering practices and meet OSHA regulations and national standard, such as ASME and ASTM specifications.  Our Refrigeration Process is a completely closed system so a release of ammonia is very unlikely.  If such a release were to occur, monitoring devices would immediately alert us so that quick action can be taken to minimize the impact.  These and other activities are part of our Emergency Contingency Plan that is coordinated with the Caroline County LEPC and/or local Fire Department.\n\nOur policy is to continually seek ways to improve the safety of our operations and our Federalsburg facility has been designed to include the latest in safety and environmental protection advancements used by our similar facilities throughout the USA.  As evidence of this commitment, we completed a process hazard analysis in October 2001 and are actively resolving recommendations from that analysis.  Full reviews and updates of our ?Process Safety and Risk Management Program? and ?Emergency Response Plan? were completed in October and all changes are in place and operating as planned.  Operating procedures are being updated and will be completed by the end of November 2001.  We will continue to monitor all operations to identify ways to continue to improve and maintain our leadership in environmental, health and safety practices."
