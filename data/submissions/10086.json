The Facility Policy\n\n  The owners, management, and employees of Speltz Elevator are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of propane. If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of propane.\n\n   Propane gas is recieved and stored for business use.\n\n   The maximum quantity of propane gas stored would be 13,000 pounds in our 3-1000 gallon storage tanks and 1-500 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n 3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 1000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent capacity (3600 pounds) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion causing a 1 psi overpressure. According to EPA lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is .17 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario for propane would be the failure of one 1000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent resulting in two-thirds of a vapor cloud explosion causing a 1 psi overpressure.  According to EPA lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is (factor of .67 X .17 miles = .11 miles) .11 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n   For propane, NFPA-58 rules.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History.\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that:\n        have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property d"

A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standards, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n b. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n c. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific propane safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
