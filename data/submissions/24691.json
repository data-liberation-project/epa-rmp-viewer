Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n   2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to repackage and distribute chlorine and to distribute sulfur dioxide to water treatment facilities and general industry.  We also manufacture sodium hypochlorite (bleach) as a byproduct of the chlorine packaging process.  Chlorine is received by rail car and sulfur dioxide is received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (no packaging of sulfur dioxide is done at this facility).  Chlorine from rail cars is used to fill DOT approved containers.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 580,000 pounds.  Average inventory is much less.\n\n\n   3. The worst-case release scenario and the al"

The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n   5. Five-year accident history\n\nWithin the past five years, this facility has had one accident that qualifies to be reported as part of the Risk Management Plan.  This accident resulted in minor injuries to two employees.  There was no on site property damage or known off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n   6. The emergency response program\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We have discussed this program with our employees and facility neighbors as well the Hillsborough County Incident Team, the City of Tampa Incident Team, and the Hillsborough County Fire Department.  \n\n\n   7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed before 1960.  We continue to participate in the Chlorine Institute and National Association of Chemical Distributors programs, and continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Process guidelines."
