      "SummaryText": "The City of Ridgeland is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and health.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes procedures for the operation, maintenace , emergency reaponse, and employee training associated with the regulated process at this facilty.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible release of regulated substances and adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.    The City of Ridgeland operates a water supply well located on School Street in Ridgeland, Mississippi.  The City utilizes two one-ton cylinders of chlorine to disinfect wate prior to distribution of water to end users.  The worst-case scenario for the School Stret water well involves the catastrophic release of a full on-ton chlorine cylinder.  The potentenial radious of impact was estimated by RMP Comp to be approximatly 1.3 miles.  The likelihood of this type of realease is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario evaluated for the School Street water well involves the release of chlorine from a disconnected tranfer hose.  The potential radius of impact was estimated by RMP*Comp to be approximately 0.1 miles.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases resulting in signifcant onsite or off-site impacts have occurred.  In the event of an accidnetal release of chlorine from the site, the City of Ridgeland Fire Department would be notified.  The Fire Department has the personnel and equipement to mitigate such situations."
