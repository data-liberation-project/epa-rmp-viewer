      "SummaryText": "Delta Trading, LC in January of 2004.  The facility is currently configured as an Liquefied Petroleum Gasoline (\"LPG\") / crude oil blending and transfer facility. The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189 and Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program. This is an RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 facility.  Currently, the facility is not fully operational, but is continuing to follow the existing plan as set up by the previous owner, Coastal Petroleum.  The prevention program is described below.  (Please be advised that Delta will modify the plan as processes are modified or become operational).  Delta will incorporate the new notification requirements regarding spill notifications within six months and emergency contact information within one month of changes.\n\nDelta Trading has a commitment to employees and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of covered processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe prevention program is based th Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA's) Process Safety Managemetn (PSM) standard. The PSM standard includes the following areas: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits. Planned changes to improve safety have "

      "SummaryText": "been established based on compliance with the Process Safety Management audits and revalidation of the Process Hazard Analysis. Training includes employee responsibilities in the Process Safety Management program, Emergency Response, Hot Work Permit Procedure, Code of Safe Work Practices, and Operating Procedures.\n\nThe facility is designed to store, load and unload natural gasoline and crude products. The storage tanks have various capacities ranging from 37,000 gallons to 105,000 gallons. The tanks are administratively controlled to hold liquefied petroleum gasoline at 90% maximum capacity; therefore the worst-case flammable scenario is based on a 94,500-gallon release.\n\nDelta Trading maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The facility has a Hazardous Materials Business Response Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department - Certified Unified Program Agency. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area. The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, and after due dilegence upon transfer of ownership, this facility has not had an accidental release.\n \nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards. Delta is committed to operations which are safe for employees and the surrounding community."
