      "SummaryText": "TXU Energy Services is a TXU Company which is committed to providing quality utility services to industry while maintaining the highest standards of safety for both employees and the public.  The system described in this submittal is a refrigeration system utilized in the production of corn dogs by Sara Lee Foods, a subsidiary of Sara Lee Corporation.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the chemical of concern.  It is used as the refrigerant in the system which refrigerates the raw materials used in the corn dog manufacturing and freezes the final product.  A total of 80,000 pounds of ammonia is recirculated and/or stored in the system.  The design and construction of the system is in accordance with the applicable guidelines and recommendations of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is continuously monitored and inspected by personnel who are qualified and trained in accordance with the requirements of the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association.  These operators continuously monitor the system for any indication of leaks or equipment problems using a process control system and permanent, continuous ammonia detectors capable of distinguishing the presence of ammonia in the atmosphere down to a few parts per million.  In addition, the system is visually inspected via a walk-through checklist once every four (4) hours, twenty-four (24) hours per day.  Any indication of deviation from process set points or leaks would result in the immediate isolation of the problem from the remainder of the system for prompt repair.  Design, maintenance, repair, and operation of the system are conducted in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Haza"

      "SummaryText": "rdous Chemicals).  In the event that a leak should occur in the system in spite of precautions taken, the system is equipped with ammonia detectors which are located at strategic points throughout the facility.  These ammonia detectors will sound an alarm and alert the operators upon detecting an ammonia level in the air greater than thirty-five (35) parts per million, which is well below the OSHA Permissible Exposure Level of fifty (50) parts per million.  \n\nThe facility has experienced one reportable release of ammonia in the past five years.  This was a release of approximately 85 lbs on August 6, 1999.  No injuries occurred as a result of this release, but employees were briefly evacuated due to ammonia odor in the production area.\n\nTXU Energy Services has implemented an Emergency Response Plan to be followed in the event of an accident or release.  This Emergency Response Plan describes the notification protocol to be used in the event of an ammonia release and the response action to be taken to contain or stop the release.  The notifications in the event of a sudden release of over 100 lbs of ammonia would include the local fire department, the Tarrant County Local Emergency Planning Committee, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the National Response Center.  The fire department and the Tarrant County Local Emergency Planning Committee have been provided with copies of the facility Emergency Response Plan.  The local fire department has been to the site for a review of the facility, ammonia refrigeration system, and response procedures."
