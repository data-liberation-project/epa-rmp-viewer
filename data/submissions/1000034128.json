Safety relief valves, bypass flow valves, check valves, gas detection around pressurized bullet tanks and truck loading area and remote access emergency shutdown devices are in place at the facility.  The facility is manned continuously and monitored via SCADA on a 24 hours/day, 7days/week, 365 days/year basis by SCADA operators located at the Marathon Kenedy Office.  Employees have received hands-on fire extinguisher training along with function specific training as required by OSHA.  New employees receive classroom instruction as well as one-on-one training with experienced employees prior to being allowed to operate any equipment.  The facility is equipped with a flare system that prevents atmospheric release of product.  Marathon has a Safe Work Permitting program and Lockout/Tagout procedures which are strictly enforced.  Marathon's Safe Work Permitting program covers various tasks (e.g., hot work, confined space entry, vehicle access to restricted areas, high H2S situations, and any other hazardous work that requires additional planning and/or monitoring).  Marathon has an established event management process that requires reporting of events regardless of severity.  The process concludes with implementation of corrective and preventative measures.  This facility conducts periodic Process Hazard Analysis studies.",

      "SummaryText": "Natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility via pipeline from several Central Production Facilities.  The natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility through a pig trap and a multi-finger slug catcher.  Gas from the slug catcher is compressed by one of four single staged flow-through compressors, dehydrated by one of two glycol dehydration units then sent to multiple sales points via two sales scrubbers.  The liquids from the slug catcher are routed to the liquids side of the process where any water is separated from the liquids.  The liquids flow through a caustic wash system to remove H2S, and a carbon filtration unit to treat the color (if needed) for pipeline quality purposes. The resulting LNG is then stored in pressurized bullet tanks prior to exiting the facility via pipeline (the normal operation mode after June 2013), or by truck (used during periods of pipeline shutdowns) to a third party gas plant for further processing.  LNG is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Because LNG is pressurized flammable gas, it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent fire/explosion risks and reduce health threats to our workers and neighbors.
