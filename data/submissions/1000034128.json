      "SummaryText": "Natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility via pipeline from several Central Production Facilities.  The natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility through a pig trap and a multi-finger slug catcher.  Gas from the slug catcher is compressed by one of four single staged flow-through compressors, dehydrated by one of two glycol dehydration units then sent to multiple sales points via two sales scrubbers.  The liquids from the slug catcher are routed to the liquids side of the process where any water is separated from the liquids.  The liquids flow through a caustic wash system to remove H2S, and a carbon filtration unit to treat the color (if needed) for pipeline quality purposes. The resulting LNG is then stored in pressurized bullet tanks prior to exiting the facility via pipeline (the normal operation mode after June 2013), or by truck (used during periods of pipeline shutdowns) to a third party gas plant for further processing.  LNG is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Because LNG is pressurized flammable gas, it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent fire/explosion risks and reduce health threats to our workers and neighbors.  Marathon has implemented various health and safety programs and processes and will strictly adhere to all Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations.   \r\n\r\nSafety depends on:\t\t\r\n(a) The manner in which we handle this product\t\t\r\n(b) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility\t\t\r\n(c) Operating and maintenance procedures, and \t\t\r\n(d) Employee training\t\r\n\r\nMarathon Eagle Ford Asset Team's emergency response program details employee responsibilities, actions and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and the LEPC to notify potentially affected neighbors. \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to:\t\t\t\t\r\n(a) Receive and store Liquified Petroleum Gas from surrounding production wells;\t\t\t\t\r\n(b) Remove excess water and contaminants\t\t\t\t\r\n(c) Transf"
