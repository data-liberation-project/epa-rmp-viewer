Follow all Authority policies and plans pertaining to safety.\n\n\n\n\nAppomattox River Water Authority\n\nBrief History\nThe Appomattox River Water Authority was created by the General Assembly in 1962 under the Water & Sewer Authorities Act to provide an adequate water supply to its members.  Membership is made up of the City of Petersburg, the City or Colonial Heights, Chesterfield County, Dinwiddie County and Prince George County.  \n \n$8.5 million of revenue bonds were sold in October, 1964 to build a Treatment Plant, water lines, dam and reservoir.  Construction started in 1966 and was completed in 1968 for the 22 MGD facilities.  In October 1983 the Authority issued $12.5 million of Revenue Bonds to expand the Plant to 46 MGD and the work was completed in late 1985. $2.2 million of Revenue Bonds were issued in 1991 to fund two sludge lagoons.  In 1997 the Authority built a $2.5 million chloramine addition to the plant with its own funds.  Only a portion of the 1983 Bonds remain outstanding.\n\nFacilities\n1.  Land - Approximately 6,000 acres were purchased.  3,100 acres was flooded for Lake Chesdin, 2,700 acres is a flooding area surrounding the lake and approximately 200 acres makes up the treatment plant complex and immediate area.\n\n2.  Dam & Reservoir - The Brasfield Dam impounds the Appomattox River to form Lake Chesdin.  The lake stores approximately 12 billion gallons of water.  The dam is 55 feet at the highest point, 1250 feet long and has an 800 foot long spillway.\n\n3.  Filter plant - The filter plant complex houses the Authority's Administrative, Laboratory, Operational and Maintenance departments.  The plant itself is capable of 46 MGD of treatment capacity, has 6.5 million gallons of storage capacity and can pump up to 46 MGD to its members.\n\n4.  Pipe lines - The Authority owns and maintains approximately thirteen miles of 42\", 30\", 24\" and 16\" transmission lines.\n\n"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n1980 to 1998 - None\n\nJune 22, 1998 - two employees, one from maintenance and an asstistant operator, were changing  chlorine cylinders. They purged the pig tails and cut off the manifold valves. The two changing the cylinders were called away for a problem.  The Assistant then cut the two stand-by cylinders into service by opening the manifold and cylinder valves and they left.  A short time later the assistant and the operator returned to complete the cylinder change out. The assistant cracked the pig tail nut at the cylinder and heard a leak.  He quickly tightened the nut.  The operator tried it with the same result.  The operator decided to purge the line again.  He opened the mainfold vavle for the cylinder and assumed the other cylinders were not open.  Since they were open, he had charged the pig tail with chlorine in stead of purging the line.  When he cracked the pig tail nut again the pig tail \"blew off\" and a chlorine leak occured.  The leak amounted to 740 pounds of chlorine and an evacuation of the plant.\n\nJuly 23, 1998 to June 1, 1999 - None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARWA - Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Authority's personnel are trained to respond to small leaks of chlorine, ammonia or propane.\nSevere leaks will be handled by the Chesterfield Emergency Response Team by calling 911.\n\nEmployees are trained annually on eleven safety programs and records are kept of the tarining. Approximately one safety area is reviewed monthly.   The annual chlorine safety, respirator training, emergency action plans, personal protective equipment and risk management plans all effect the Authority's ability to handle emergencies.  \n\nARWA - Planned Changes to Safety\n\nThe Authority's safety plans are reviewed annually and approp"
