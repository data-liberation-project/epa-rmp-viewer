The terminal processes this product by heating it to +40 \u00b0F and loading it onto transport trucks for shipment out.

Ultraviolet flame detectors monitor the plant to detect fires.  The plant is attended by at least two operators at all times.  They log field operating data at two-hour intervals and monitor plant equipment using the following monitoring and control systems:\r\n\r\n*The main control panel located in the central control room displays pressures, temperatures, valve positions, and flow rates and provides for remote operation and manual or automatic shutdown of valves and equipment.\r\n\r\n*The emergency control panel also located in the central control room displays readings of combustible vapor detectors and fire detectors.
