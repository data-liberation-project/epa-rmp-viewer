      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility:\n\nAir Products ECD relies on numerous programs to ensure early identification of and proper response to potential emergencies, including: \n\n     Training and drills in emergency preparedness, hazardous materials training, disaster response \n     and control, first-aid, and fire-and-rescue techniques; \n\n     Frequent auditing of all preparedness programs, safety training and education; and\n\n     Regular review, follow-up, and maintenance of all company operations and equipment.  \n\nOur facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, participate in joint emergency drills, and gain familiarity with our operations.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAir Products facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Air Products makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations, including a very active Community Advisory Panel, which meets at least quarterly.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility provides high purity chemicals to the semi-conductor industry.  The regulated process involves storage, blending, repackaging and shipment of the covered substances.  The regulated substances are hydrochloric acid (37 wt.%) and ammonium hydroxide (29 wt.%).  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.airproducts.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic su"

Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved modeling methods, the worst-case release scenario for hydrochloric acid could potentially affect offsite receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  Diked containment was considered as a passive mitigation measure in the worst-case analysis for hydrochloric acid.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  The USEPA requires that the results of the alternative-case release scenario analysis be reported for each toxic present.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenarios for hydrochloric acid and for ammonium hydroxide do not impact offsite public receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or active mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distances reported.  Diked containment was considered as a passive mitigation measure in the alternative-case analysis for hydrochloric acid.  The passive mitigation measure considered in the alternative-case analyses for ammonium hydroxide is storage in an enclosed building.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.

      "SummaryText": "s maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can readily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history. \n\nWe have never had a release of hydrochloric acid (37 wt.%) or ammonium hydroxide (29 wt.%) that has resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact.   \n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to offensively respond and neutralize any release of a hazardous substance.  Our employees regularly undergo extensive training in emergency response actions and methods.  Our facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, gain familiarity with our operations, and participate in joint emergency drills.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.\n  \nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facilities continually evaluate and implement employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from hazard reviews.  We make changes to improve reliability and safety based on information developed within our organization and industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement, process re-design, and formulation substitution.  Air Products is committed to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care Initiative Management Code on Process Safety, and is ISO 14001 certified."
