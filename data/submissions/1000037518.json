The detection will activate the alarm system to notify the plant operators, shut down the ventilation system, and activate the scrubber systems. \r\n\r\nWest Hickman Waste Water Treatment Plant has a comprehensive and thorough emergency response plan. In the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak or spill, all personnel are trained to immediately proceed with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Notify Plant Operations Supervisor Senior and then the Solids Process Supervisor.\r\n\r\n2. Plant Operations, Solids Process Supervisor, or their designee along with Plant Operator on duty will investigate the leak and determine if the leak is minor or major (based on gas levels in ppm established in the facility's emergency plan). \r\n3. Minor leak - Plant Operator on duty and Supervisor or designee to repair.\r\n\r\n4. Major leak - initiate chlorine evacuation plan and notify response agencies.\r\n\r\nLFUCG conducts awareness training for newly hired employees on the safety and safe practices related to working around the covered process areas.  Training for operators, maintenance personnel, and other staff who have specific job duties and responsibilities in the covered process areas is conducted periodically according to an established training program for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  Employees involved in the covered processes are given new training based on management of changes required by process, procedure, or other changes that would affect the processes.  All operating employees have been given extensive training in operating procedures, maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and evacuation procedures.\r\n\r\nAs required, LFUCG has conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA) of processes based on process changes; and has conducted a formal compliance audit (CA) of the RMP program.  The PHA and the CA teams were facilitated by a person knowledgeable in the PH"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\nWest Hickman Waste Water Treatment Plant\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the intent of Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government - Division of Water Quality (LFUCG) as the operator of this facility to protect its employees as well as the community from the dangers that are associated with hazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this goal at the West Hickman Waste Water Treatment Plant; LFUCG has implemented specific controls, policies, and procedures to prevent and/or to minimize the risk to the community. LFUCG has implemented the elements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the corresponding Process Safety Management Program (PSM) to prevent and minimize the impact of the accidental release of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP for West Hickman Wastewater Treatment Plant has been prepared in accordance with EPA Risk Management program guidelines (40 CFR 68) and is designed specifically for the West Hickman location. The West Hickman Waste Water Treatment Plant is located in Nicholasville, Kentucky, 645 West Hickman Plant Road and is operated by the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government - Division of Water Quality. \r\n\r\nThe primary function of this facility is the treatment of wastewater, in doing so Chlorine is used for disinfection purposes and Sulfur Dioxide is used for the neutralization of chlorine in plant effluent. The probability of a release at this facility is classified as low. The enclosed Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide building with alarmed detection systems will notify plant staff if a leak should occur. The air scrubber systems start automatically if a leak is detected. These systems will greatly reduce the risk of a release from reaching the outside atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe maximum  chlorine stored at this site is 14 one ton cylinders.  The maximum sulfur dioxide stored at this site is 12 one ton cylinders.  Based on the quantity of regulated chemicals in each covered process the facility is subject to Program"

      "SummaryText": "3 of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations at 40 CFR 68 and also subject to the Process Safety Management Standards (PSM) at 29 CFR 1910.120.\r\n\r\nThe last major change to the covered processes for the chlorine or sulfur dioxide processes occurred in 2001 when the pressure delivery system of chlorine and sulfur dioxide was replaced by an individual cylinder vacuum regulator system.  The risk of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release from the system piping was significantly reduced when this process change was implemented due to the fact that the individual regulators upon loss of vacuum will immediately close the gas cylinder.  This action results in the system shutting itself down if there is a process piping or delivery system malfunction.\r\n\r\nIf a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak occurred, LFUCG Division of Water Quality employees and the LFUCG Fire Department are well prepared and trained to respond to the situation. LFUCG employees are trained in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide. They are also trained on initial startup procedures, normal operating procedures, temporary operating procedures, emergency operating procedures, emergency shutdown procedures, normal shutdown procedures, and startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown procedure.\r\n\r\nThe following agencies are available to respond to a chemical release at the West Hickman Wastewater Plant: Lexington Fire Department, Fayette Division of Emergency Management, and Jessamine County Fire Department. Other responding agencies are: State Fire Marshall's Office, Commonwealth Emergency Response Commission (CERC), Kentucky DES Area Coordinator, Kentucky Department for Natural Environmental Protection, and Chemtrac.  The primary response agency to a chemical release at this site is the Lexington Fire Department.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and process buildings are designed to contain a release and minimize release to the atmosphere.
