Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nProcedures and practices are established to help ensure covered process equipment is maintained in a safe and reliable condition, to include: pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems. The basic aspects of this program include: training, written procedures, inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and the applicable safe work practices necessary to perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures confirm work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to verify equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or appropriate personnel/teams will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to verify the continued safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance.

Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Freeport Terminal facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used for the safe and reliable operation of facility processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific teams/groups within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining current and up to date process safety information. Process safety information documents are readily available for review and use (e.g. during unit process hazard analysis, etc.). The facility Management of Change (MOC) process is utilized to maintain process safety information current and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition) in the unit specific Process Safety Information (PSI). The respective teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and instrumented protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, etc.).\r\n\r\nNumerous technical documents are also maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to help ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. Meetings are held monthly with facility contractors and plant personnel to promote effective information sharing and to ensure site and work requirements are adequately communicated.\r\n\r\nG. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\r\n\r\nAs required by the OSHA PSM standard and in accordance with the EPA RMP Accident Prevention Program requirements, the Freeport Terminal facility conducts PSSRs for any new facility or when existing facilities/processes are modified and requires a change in the process safety information. The intent of the PSSR is to confirm various features are in place prior to placing the equipment in service, such as: proper hazard reviews, procedures, personnel training, and equipment is constructed and installed per design. The PSSR review team uses checklist type questions to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that Accident Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented. The PSSR process is an integral part of the overall facility Management of Change / Pre-Startup Safety Review process. As indicated below under the Management of Change element, an MOC Subcommittee has been established and meets on a routine basis to monitor the facility MOC/PSSR process, conduct training and education on the process, conduct audits of completed MOCs, and to update the MOC/PS"

Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date.\r\n\r\nE. Training\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, a comprehensive training program is maintained consisting of various job/certification models for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nF. Contractors\r\n\r\nThe Freeport Terminal facility uses contractors as part of its regular work force and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nA formal PHA process is established to help ensure that potential process-related hazards are identified and controlled. PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations. Additional PHA tools and methodologies (e.g., Layers of Protection Analysis, What-If, etc.) are utilized based on need and appropriateness for the process under review. The PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise.\r\n\r\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate priority attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the facility formal corrective action tracking database.\r\n\r\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Freeport Terminal facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nJ. Management of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are developed to manage changes to covered processes. These procedures require that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and changes to facilities that may affect a covered process, are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Hazard reviews are conducted to verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated as necessary to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. An MOC Subcommittee has been established and meets on a routine basis to monitor the facility MOC/PSSR process, conduct training and education on the process, conduct audits of completed MOCs, and to update the MOC/PSSR program and procedure as needed.\r\n\r\nK. Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Freeport Terminal facility utilizes a well-established, formal incident reporting and investigation process to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, chemical release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs, and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release should occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nII.\tDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Freeport Terminal Midstream C5+ Storage & Loading facility is designed to receive, store, and export C5+ hydrocarbons.  The C5+ system is designed to receive 40,000 bbl/day of C5+ product on a continuous basis from the Sweeny NGL Fractionation 1 facility located at the Sweeny Refinery, and to load parcels as large as 300,000 bbl onto tankers at a rate of 15,000 bbl/hr from still tanks.  The C5+ Storage & Loading process utilizes the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant, offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics:  There are no RMP covered Toxics over the threshold quantity for this process.\r\n\r\nFlammables:  Butane; isoPentane; Pentane.\r\n\r\nIII.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the Risk Management Plan rule is the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment to examine and communicate potential offsite impacts of releases of regulated hazardous substances. Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario. The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance"

The ARS represents a more credible, but still potentially significant, accidental release of a regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS. However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may not have been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case alternate release scenarios. In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, certain information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. were considered.\r\n\r\nNote: For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios are not shown in the Executive Summary.\r\n\r\nIV.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place for the Freeport Terminal C5+ Storage & Loading facility.
