      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nSuperior Pipeline Co. (SPC) owns and operates the natural gas treating and dehydration plant in Red Oak, Oklahoma. The plant is primarily designed to remove CO2 from incoming natural gas via amine treatment.  The plant also removes trace amounts of H2S and water vapor from natural gas via physical separation and dehydration.  Section 112(r ) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Panola plant because it handles a process flammable (methane).  The natural gas entering the plant is approximately 96% methane.  Methane exists in excess of threshold quantities within the process vessels and piping of the facility.  SPC management is aware of potential hazards posed by handling process flammables.  Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases and train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release. \n\nThe accidental release and emergency response policies are detailed in the facility Emergency Response plan.  SPC has considered the impact of a \"worst case\" accident.  In this case, the \u00bfworst case\u00bf would be a total release of all methane being processed at the facility, resulting in the instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which ignites and explodes. Using the EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp software version 1.07, the potential radius of impact, due to the explosion, was calculated to extend 0.2 miles.  Global positioning system (GPS) was utilized to estimate public receptors within a 1 mile radius.  It was determined that the worst case event would affect nearby structures, and there would be offsite consequences of such an explosion.  This event is highly un-likely, however a consideration of the 0.2 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.  SPC has reported zero accidents at the Panola plant in the past five years.  \n\nSPC is implementing safety programs and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Operation, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures are being"

In addition, SPC has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Wilburton Fire Department, Panola Volunteer Fire Department, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. Panola Plant personnel and responders will be required to participate in facility-specific training.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of risks associated with natural gas treatment facility.  We stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community.\n\n\n2.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\nThe required elements of hazard assessment are as follows:\n\u00a768.25 Worst-case release scenario analysis\n\u00a768.28 Alternative release scenario analysis\n\u00a768.30 Defining offsite impacts - population\n\u00a768.33 Defining offsite impacts - environment\n\u00a768.36 Review and update\n\u00a768.39 Documentation\n\u00a768.42 Five-year accident history\n\n2.1 Input Parameters (Applicability) \u00bf \u00a768.20 - \u00a768.22\n\nFor the Panola gas treatment system, the process piping is where the worst-case release quantity is expected to reside.   According to the June 2007 analyses (Attachment 1), the estimated gas volume held in process equipment at the facility was 4,728.98 cubic feet.  The estimated volume for the process piping was based on approximately 10% of the equipment/vessel volumes, yielding 472.90 cubic feet and a total plant volume of 5,201.88 cubic feet.  Back pressure valves will not allow the plant operating pressure to exceed 850 psi.  Utilizing ideal gas law equations, the calculated density of methane at 850 psi and 150 degrees F is approximately 2.12 lb/cubic ft.   Therefore the amount of process methane is 11,027.99 lb which exceeds the 10,000 lb methane threshold for RMP applicability.  Methane is the only regulated substance at the facility.\n\nPer \u00a768.25(e), because the regulated flammable substance is a gas at ambient temperature and is handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, we"

Don Love, Ph.D, P.E. facilitated the effort.  Dr. Love has over 50 years of experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated.  \nSPC has established a system to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations.  SPC also assures that the recommendations are being resolved in a timely manner and that the resolutions are documented.  SPC has developed a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed.  SPC has communicated the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\nThe process hazard analysis will be updated and revalidated every 5 years, in accordance with CFR 1910.119(e), to assure consistency with the current process.  All MOC (Management of Change) items will be reviewed at the time of the re-evaluation to ensure all changes to the process are evaluated for hazards and hazard controls.
