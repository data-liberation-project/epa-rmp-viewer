Emergency response actions are coordinated with local emergency response agencies annually.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCrystal Creamery Modesto performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in June 2022 and generated a list of recommendations to improve safety and mitigate potential releases. Crystal Creamery Modesto will address PHA recommendations within the 2 \u00bd-year time frame set forth in the January 1, 2015, CalARP requirements. These changes to improve safety include:\n\n\u0095\tAssess ammonia detection system and emergency shutdown requirements to IIAR 9 for both the A Side and B Side ammonia refrigeration systems. \n\u0095\tUpdate access to computerized system controls for operators.\n\u0095\tRestrict unauthorized personnel from accessing engine rooms.\n\u0095\tDevelop operating procedures for the pump down of equipment.\n\nCrystal Creamery Modesto recognizes that the CalARP/RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia hand"

The Crystal Creamery Modesto ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components upon deviations from normal operating conditions. Further, the pressure relief vales of the A Side and B Side refrigeration processes are equipped with pressure relief valves that discharge to a water-filled diffusion tank. \n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n\u0095\tCentral computer monitoring and control system;\n\u0095\tEmergency shutdown systems;\n\u0095\tComponent specific safety shutdowns that are independent of the central computer control system;\n\u0095\tFire alarms and sprinkler system; and\n\u0095\tAmmonia leak detection systems in the engine rooms and process areas with ammonia equipment;\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nCalARP regulations require a review"
