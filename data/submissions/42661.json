The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties.  BWC also has delayed coking operations in Area 3, which is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for Area 3.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific regulated substances that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  Regulated substances are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA.  BWC  has quantities of various regulated substances above the threshold amounts.  \n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at BWC\nSection 3: Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\nSection 4: BWC Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSection 5: Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSection 1:\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\n\nEquipment at the various units must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

Process Safety Information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, limits for specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information, was compiled for each process unit.\n\nPSI is used in process unit hazard analyses, inspection, maintenance, and training activities.  This information is kept current by management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are discussed further in this section.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazards Analysis\n\nBWC conducts process hazards analyses (PHAs) to ensure that hazards associated with process units are identified and controlled.  Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage those hazards.  SBR has used the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery's primary process hazards analysis technique.  Some of the revalidation has been done using the what if and risk matrix methodologies.  Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate"

      "SummaryText": "significantly from the original design safety features, SBR updates and revalidates the hazard analyses every five years.  \n\nAs part of the technical studies, BWC conducted a seismic review of the refinery.  The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company.  The objective of seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substance having off-site consequence would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nBWC has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.  The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.\n\nThese procedures are used as references by experienced operators and for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the management of change process and through annual certification.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nBWC's general policy requires operating personnel to be trained in the safe operation of facilities, handling process upsets, emergency response, and personal safety.  Employees who understand the process and how to safely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents.  \n\nRefresher training for all operations and maintenance employees in Safety, Health, and Environmental subjects and operating procedures (as appropriate) is provided at varying intervals, depending upon requirements. \n\n4.5  Management of Change\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) review is required for modifications to facilities or changes to p"

      "SummaryText": "5.\tFive-Year Accidental Release Summary\n\nBWC compiled a five-year accident history for accidental releases from covered processes in Areas 1 and 2 that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  The compilation of this information satisfies the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implementing regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68).\n\nThe five-year accident history provides an explanation of the factors that caused the accident, the on- and off-site impacts of the accident, and the changes made by SBR to minimize the likelihood that these accidents will occur again.\n\nBWC reviewed all incident, emergency release, and equipment breakdown reports from June 1998 through May 2002 to identify accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes that involved the impacts described above.   One incident involving a regulated substance from a covered process was identified:  a gas release involving a regulated toxic substance that resulted in an injury to an employee.  SBR substituted the regulated toxic substance with a more inherently safe substance throughout the refinery as a result of the incident.\n\nSection 6.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nBWC has established a comprehensive Emergency Response Program.  The purpose of the program is to protect workers, the public, and the environment from harm due to refinery emergencies.  The program includes procedures to provide for comprehensive emergency response through the following:\n\n* First aid and medical treatment\n* Emergency incidents, including fire, potential fire, hazardous materials releases, and natural disasters such as floods, winds, earthquake and electrical storms\n* Emergency evacuation and rescue\n* Notification of local, state and federal emergency response agencies and the public if an incident occ"
