If an accidental release should occur the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Barton county LEPC, and /or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the enviroment.\n\n\n\n2 Facility Information. The primary activity at the facility is the operation of the family farm,but we do sell anhydrous ammonia to a few neighbor farmers as a service to them since the local fertilizer plant quit selling anhydrous.\n\n\n\n3 Accidental release Prevention Program. The facility follows the provisions of Missouri State regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n4 Five year Accident History.there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five years.No death,injury,property damage at our facility, nor to our knowledge has there been any off site accidental releases. We have handled NH3 for over 35 years without incident or injury and plan to continue safely in the years ahead.\n\n\n\n5 Emergency Response Program. We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major accidental release.If a large release takes place the planned response is to evacuate the area and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers\n\n\n\n6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process.Periodic evaluations are performed to access the condition of our facility. There are no specific safety reccomendations regarding our storage and use of anhydrous ammonia to be implemented at this time. We our proud of our accident free safety record and want to carry on that tradition and continue to be a good neighbor."
