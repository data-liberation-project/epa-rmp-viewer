This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.   It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass water treatment.  We have one (1) regulated substance present at our facilities.  These substances include Chlorine Gas.  Chlorine Gas is used for the treatment and disinfectant of raw water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The General accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-specific prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the entire necessary step to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.  The following section briefly describes the element of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLee County WSC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficient.  Any finding related to the hazards analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lee County WSC maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as "
