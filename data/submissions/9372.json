Our accidental release policy involves a unified approach that integrates technology, procedures and management practices.The Emergency Response Policy involves preparation of plans tailored to our facility and the emergency response services available in the community and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response program requirements.\nThe W.A.Oeffler-Norwood Water Treatment Plant is located in the Norland area of North West Dade County, a largely residential area, with three schools in close proximity. The chlorination facility is located in the North West corner of the property.This facility normally contains six to eight  ton cylinders of liquid chlorine, five wall mounted chlorinators, two sets of scales with dials, two inline chlorine leak detectors, and leak repair safety equipment. Directly outside the facility is two independant breathing apparatus. The operators visit the site daily during normal hourly plant inspections.\nOur general accidental release program is based on some of the follwing key elements :\n                      *  Continuous high level training of the Operators\n                      *  Preventative maintenance program\n                      *  Use of state of the art process safety equipment\n                      *  Effective operation and handling procedures, written with the participation of the Operators\n                      *  Continuous evaluation of the safety equipment and procedures\n                      *  Chemical specific training on the self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) which can\n                          be worn during connections/ disconnections of cylinders\n                      *  Yearly MSDS awareness reevaluation of hazzardous properties of toxic materials\nThe W.A.Oeffler-Norwood Water Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five years.\nThe facility has an emergen"
