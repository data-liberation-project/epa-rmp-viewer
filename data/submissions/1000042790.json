      "SummaryText": "Smithfield Packing, Inc. is located at 3660 North Parkway, Cumming, GA, 30040.  The facility processes meat products for human consumption.  Products include pre-cooked sausage patties, links and crumbles for the food service industry. The SIC code for the operation is 2013; the NAICS code is 311612.  The facility has approximately 143 full time employees (management, administrative, plant and drivers) and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year.  The facility operates three production shifts and a sanitation shift.  Facility personnel are distributed between shifts.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The refrigeration system inventory exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced a significant release incident as defined by 40 CFR 68.28 within the last five years.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This serves as the prevention plan required by RMP.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety "

The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours during business/production hours.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the affected portions of the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors that are triggered by the presence of ammonia in the compressor area and refrigerated spaces. The ammonia detectors will trigger a visual/audible alarm if the ammonia level exceeds the detector setpoints.\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department or outside contractors, as necessary, to respond to emergencies involving ammonia. In an effort to improve the safety of our facility, we have expanded our staffing in the refiigeration area to improve coverage of the ammonia system.  Additionally, enhanced training on hazardous materials will take place in calendar year 2013.  The facility will coordinate with the local responders as to the training; possibly including training with the agency.  The facility has an excellent record and has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or "

Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia, in the event they should occur.\n\n\n\nThe facility has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia, inclduing public officials.  A release of 100 pounds or more must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.  The Fire Department will be provided with a copy of the facility's Emergency Action Plan, upon request.  The First aid and medical treatment of anyone effected by Ammonia is contained in the Emergency Action Plan. \n\n\n\nThe facility will make changes to the system and train as necessary to resolve items noted during the Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audit, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, and Mechanical Integrity inspections to improve the safety of the system. Changes will be placed on an action list, evaluated, and implemented in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nThe Smithfield Packing Co. and Farmland Foods merged and form SMithfield Farmland Corp. on April 28, 2014.
