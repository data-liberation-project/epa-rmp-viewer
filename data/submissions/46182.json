      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIntroduction:\nThe City of Sunnyvale's Water Pollution Control Plant (SWPCP) uses chemicals such as chlorine and sulfur dioxide to disinfect treated wastewater to provide water safe for discharge to the environment and for recycled water for uses such as landscaping irrigation. Storing large quantities of these chemicals can be a hazard if they are not handled properly. We take our safety obligations for storing and using hazardous chemicals as seriously as we take providing reliable wastewater treatment.  This Summary describes the steps we take to prevent an accidental chemical release, to ensure we have a safely operated plant, and how we respond to an emergency.  To date, we have an excellent record in preventing accidental releases. Please feel free to contact Lorrie Gervin, Environmental Division Manager at (408) 730-7260 if you have questions.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nThe SWPCP implements programs to comply with other accidental release prevention regulations including California's OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  In the SWPCP Priorities Policy developed by management, Safety is listed at the number one priority and is not to be compromised for any other issue.  All employees are to ensure that both employees and the community are safe at all times from any harm related to operations at the SWPCP.  Compliance is the next priority in the SWPCP Priorities Policy and should be planned for as we plan for safety, so that there is never a need to make a choice between the two.  Compliance at the SWPCP means meeting the obligations to various federal, state, and local agencies, as well as protecting the environment and providing an important service to our customers and the citizens of Sunnyvale.\n\nThe SWPCP has written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) established for all plant processes related to PSM and RMP requirements.

      "SummaryText": "r training programs for plant processes are in use for new operators.  The SWPCP has a Safety Committee consisting of representatives from each section within the Plant that meets on a monthly basis to discuss safety issues and plant operations.  Each SWPCP section has bi-weekly staff safety training meetings to provide training on pertinent operations and plans, with many of the training sessions related to chlorine and sulfur dioxide process safety.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\nThe SWPCP is located at 1444 Borregas Avenue in Sunnyvale, near the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay. SWPCP treats wastewater from the City of Sunnyvale, a small section of the City of Cupertino, and a portion of the Moffett Field Naval Air Station, located in Sunnyvale.  The plant has a treatment capacity of 29.5 million gallons per day; average flow is currently 14-16 million gallons per day. Plant processes include preliminary treatment to remove large solids and grit, primary sedimentation to remove settlable solids, oxidation ponds as secondary treatment, biological treatment to convert ammonia to nitrates, flocculation and coagulation for algae removal, filtration to remove suspended solids, disinfection to inactivate disease-causing organisms, and dechlorination of treated water prior to discharge to render chlorine harmless in the final effluent.  The SWPCP is a 24-hour per day/7-day per week operation.  A Senior Operator is always on duty at the facility and will initiate established emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release or other emergency situation.\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are regulated substances under the RMP and CalARP rules. These are stored in one-ton cylinders and exceed the RMP and Cal ARP threshold quantities. The facility also produces methane gas in its digesters which is used to power influent pump engines and for the co-generation of electricity in two 800 kW generato"

Calculations maintained at the SWPCP demonstrate that the amount of digester gas stored does not exceed the CalARP rule threshold. In addition, based on 2004 revisions to the RMP rule, methane that is used as fuel at a wastewater treatment plant is no longer covered in the RMP program by EPA.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention\nChlorine is added to the wastewater prior to discharge to kill disease-causing organisms.  Sulfur dioxide is used after disinfection is completed to convert chlorine to chloride, which is harmless to fish and other aquatic life in the receiving water.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored, transported, and applied in physically separate, but similar systems. The SWPCP's Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management Plan are based on the following key elements:\n- Management system, levels of responsibilities, and team member roles;\n- Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors;\n- A preventive maintenance and work order tracking program using Capital Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) computer programs;\n- A completed process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operations and maintenance staff participation and review;\n- Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment;\n- Use of accurate and effective operating procedures with participation of operations and maintenance staff for review and revision, as required;\n- High level of training of operators and maintenance staff; and\n- Incident investigation, inspection and auditing programs using qualified staff.\n\nProduct Delivery and Storage\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are delivered to the facility on flatbed trucks.

Once inside the SWPCP, all chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are immediately unloaded and placed inside storage buildings where they are safety-secured.  The containers are never left outside or unattended.  After the cylinders are secured in the storage buildings, an intruder alarm system is activated.  The intruder alarm system is active when SWPCP staff are not working in the storage buildings.\n\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information\nComprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazards, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance.  This information was compiled from numerous sources prior to conducting the Process Hazard Analysis.  It includes MSDS sheets, chlorine and sulfur dioxide background information, and chlorine and sulfur dioxide reaction chemistry.\n\nEquipment safety information has been compiled on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, including maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, safe upper and lower pressures, and codes and standards used to design build, and operate the processes.  SWPCP also has procedures in place to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.   \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nPlant staff, engineering, and administrative staff conducted an initial, detailed PHA in December 1993.  A revalidation of the PHA was conducted in December 1999 by a team of maintenance, operations, engineering, and administrative staff using the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) method and \"What If\" methods as per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. Another revalidation using the HAZOP and \"What if\" methodologies was completed in January 2003 using a similar team make-up.   Both revalidations were led by a consultin"

The piping and chlorine evaporator/sulfonator corrosion inspection actions are scheduled for completion by March 31, 2005 and are discussed in the \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\" section below.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe SWPCP maintains current, accurate, written operating procedures that include clear instruction for the operation of chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  Operating procedures are incorporated into operation and maintenance training programs.  Step-by-step written operating instructions were developed for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems that include procedures for process start up, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operations.  The SWPCP Safety Committee reviews and updates procedures, as needed.  Also, procedures are developed and put in place whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Operating procedures are developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on-line or the start-up for a changed process.\nOperations and Maintenance Training Program\nEach SWPCP employee presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes is trained in an overview of the process and detailed, applicable operating and maintenance procedures.  The SWPCP training program provides information to help employees understand the nature and cause of problems arising from operations involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and increases awareness of employees with respect to process hazards.

Employees must follow the requirements of the Welding, Brazing, Soldering, Cutting, and Related Hot Work SOP and a Hot Work Permit must be issued by a department supervisor before any hot work is performed outside of the designated welding booth.  Copies of all permits issued for the previous two years are kept on site.\n\nManagement of Change and Pre-startup Safety Reviews\nThe SWPCP has a process in place to implement changes or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This systems allows employees to identify and review safety hazards, provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data, evaluate the proposed change to confirm that it would not compromise system safety, and establish training requirements before implementation.  The SWPCP ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new process at the plant or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  All proposed process changes must be submitted in writing and include all schematics, diagrams, and specifications for review by Operations, Maintenance, and Management divisions and the plant-wide Safety Committee before plant management authorizes proposed changes.\n\nInternal Complianc"

Chlorine evaporators and sulfonators have a quarterly rotation.  This was found to meet the manufacturers' recommendations.\n- Documentation of implementation of action items from previous PHA and audits was completed.  Seismic improvements to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas and modified flexible connections at wall penetrations were completed.  In addition, rigid connections on the scrubber ventilation ducting were modified to allow flexibility and rigid pipe connections for piping inside the storage buildings were modified to allow limited displacement during seismic events.\n- All Preventive Operational Procedures and Preventive Maintenance activities were reviewed by management to compare manufacturers' specifications for inspection and testing procedures for consistency.  It was found that the intervals for maintenance were established based on the manufacturers' recommendations and on the Chlorine Institute guidelines.  In some cases SWPCP has increased the inspection intervals and in some cases the inspection intervals were decreased, based on staff experience with a particular piece of equipment.\n-   It was noted in the PHA evaluation that inspection and testing of the evaporators for corrosion had not been completed.  With the current piping configuration and system, it is not possible to complete an inspection for corrosion without taking apart all system elements.  A bid document was prepared in 2003 to obtain contractor services to replace piping and evaporator/sulfonator equipment.  However, no acceptable bids were received.
