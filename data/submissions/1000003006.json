Engineering practices have been observed in the design and operation of systems such that the probability of accidental release is minimal.  These practices include, but are not limited to, construction of a containment building, automatic flow shut-off devices, and the installation of sensitive detection units.  These detectors are interlocked with automatic chlorine flow shut-off devices that are designed to close as soon as a leak is detected.  Sensors provide continuous remote indication of concentration to a control room that is staffed around the clock.  The containment building ventilation and heating systems are also interlocked with the detection system such that both systems automatically shut off if a leak is detected.  Most notably, LWC operates a vacuum feed system that ensures material outside the containment building is under vacuum and will not leak unless multiple systems/equipment fail simultaneously.  An interlocked scrubber system is designed to neutralize a leak before air is reintroduction to the environment.  Redundant power supplies ensure safety systems are operational when needed.  Modifications made to the containment building meet code requirements of the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction Division of Fire Prevention for the State of Kentucky.  \n\nLWC personnel have quick access to personal protective equipment to assist with safe egress and the initial investigation.  Appropriate equipment is also readily available for more thorough investigation and isolation in a contaminated atmosphere.\n\nIn capital improvement projects within the production system, safety-related items are reviewed by a team of individuals who are knowledgeable in the covered processes.  Once identified, resolution of the safety issue is written into contract.\n\nLWC's emergency"

The plan was developed in conjunction with public emergency response authorities, in compliance with local, state, and federal laws, and has been tested to respond effectively in the event of a hazardous chemical leak.  LWC personnel are trained as emergency responders at the Technician level and have drilled with Louisville Fire Department Hazardous Response Units.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe B.E. Payne Water Treatment Plant is located at 7400 Upper River Road, Louisville, Kentucky 40059.  The chemical that is regulated by the Clean Air Act at the facility is chlorine.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nLWC has installed mitigation measures and administrative controls to reduce the probability of a hazardous chemical release.  Most significant is the containment building itself, which acts as a passive mitigation device.  This building completely encloses storage containers at the water treatment plant.  Active mitigation devices include leak detectors, automatic flow shut-off valves, a scrubbing system and interlocked doors and ventilation system.  Administrative controls include adherence to requirements of LWC's Process Safety Management Program.\n\nEstablished standard operating procedures facilitate consistency and aid in the prevention of incidents.  The Process Safety Management Program is reviewed and updated to reflect changes in safety processes and includes process hazards analysis, management of change procedures, operating procedures, safe work practices, training requirements and guidelines, mechanical integrity procedures (including maintenance checklists and daily equipment checks), pre-startup review procedures, emergency response procedures, incident investigation guidelines, and audit guidelines.  \n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases involving chlorine that resulted in deaths, inj"

The plan specifically details LWC's emergency response plan in compliance with S.A.R.A. Title III Emergency Response and Community Right to Know Act of 1986.  The plan was coordinated with the Kentucky Emergency Response Commission and the Louisville-Jefferson County, Kentucky Local Emergency Planning Committee.  In general the plan includes:\n\n1. Steps for the prevention of hazardous material spills - includes ongoing surveys of hazardous material storage and handling and employee training.\n2. Preparation for a spill - includes organization charts for handling the spill and site specific training for containment of the spill.\n3. Spill Control Plan - includes steps for notifying personnel involved and the community.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs a Total Quality Organization, LWC actively encourages improvement to all processes.  Employees are trained to recognize when and how processes can be improved.  Operating under the guidelines of Process Safety Management, the management of change element provides a mechanism for constant internal review and improvement in production quality and safety.  Additionally, Process Safety Management requires five-year reviews on aspects of the program.  Avenues for improvements in safety are identified during these reviews."
