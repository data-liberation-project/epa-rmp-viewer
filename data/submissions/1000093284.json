Newport Butane - Irwindale Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Butane Storage System.  Newport Butane - Irwindale Facility policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n4.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nNewport Butane - Irwindale Facility is located at 15763 Ornelas Street Irwindale, CA 91706.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is butane. The maximum intended inventory is 84,000 pounds (lbs.) of butane.  The butane is stored in the regulated process but is processed and packaged elsewhere that is not covered in this process. \n\n\n\n4.3    Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nAs per CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the butane storage system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the HAZARD ASSESSMENT Tab of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the HAZARD ASSESSMENT Tab of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\n4.4    Risk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of butane has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Newport Butane - Irwindale Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of even"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a butane release:\n\n?    Fire extinguishers\n\n?    Automatic sprinkler system\n\n\n\n4.5    Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Newport Butane - Irwindale Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of butane.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of butane is 84,000 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is under the 10,000-lbs. threshold for US EPA RMP, CalARP Program, and state threshold Cal/OSHA PSM. As a result, the butane covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3.\n\nThe Butane Prevention Program Level 3 elements include:\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Hot Work Permit\n\n?    Contractors\n\n?    Trade Secrets\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Hazardous Materials Business Plan.
