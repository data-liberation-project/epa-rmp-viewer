      "SummaryText": "4.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n4.1\tAccidental Release Prevention\r\nNewport Butane - Irwindale Facility has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address CalARP Program requirements.  Newport Butane - Irwindale Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Butane Storage System.  Newport Butane - Irwindale Facility policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\n4.2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance \r\nNewport Butane - Irwindale Facility is located at 15763 Ornelas Street Irwindale, CA 91706.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is butane. The maximum intended inventory is 84,000 pounds (lbs.) of butane.  The butane is stored in the regulated process but is processed and packaged elsewhere that is not covered in this process. \r\n\r\n4.3\tHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\r\nAs per CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the butane storage system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the HAZARD ASSESSMENT Tab of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook.\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\r\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the HAZARD ASSESSMENT Tab of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook.\r\n\r\n4.4\tRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of butane has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Newport Butane - Irwindale Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of even"
