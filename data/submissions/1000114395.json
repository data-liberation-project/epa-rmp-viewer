These prevention measures include elements such as employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits.  \n\nThe Chlorination Facility is equipped with many safety features to prevent public exposure in the event of a chlorine leak.  One chlorine leak detector is located in the Storage/Unloading Room and one in the Chlorine Feed Room.  To allow safety personnel time to respond to emergencies, an audible warning alarm sounds inside and outside of the building when chlorine levels reach 1.0 ppm.  At 1.0 ppm at high level alarm is sounded and the normal building ventilation system automatically shuts down to contain the chlorine.  In addition, the chlorine detector alarms are connected to the CMBP control panel, and the CMBP, and Richard Miller Water Treatment Plant SCADA system.  This alerts the staff at all plants in the event of a chlorine release. CMBP employees who are involved in chlorine operations are trained in specific procedures regarding handling and storage of chlorine at the facility. There is also a single pass chlorine scrubber which uses a dry media. The scrubber activates automatically in the event of a chlorine alarm, and must be manually shut down. The exhaust vent on the scrubber is equipped with a chlorine detector to ensure chlorine is not passed to the atmosphere. \n\n\n\nSection 68.155(d): Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThe Charles M.

It is assumed that the container ruptures and its entire contents escape to the outside air in 10 minutes. Additionally, the worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.  The rate of chlorine release for the worst-case scenario is 200 pounds of chlorine per minute.  Using the reference tables in the USEPA RMP Guidance for WWTPs, a toxic endpoint of 3.0 miles was determined for the worst case scenario.  The residential population within a 3.0 mile radius of influence for Charles M. Bolton Plant is determined to be approximately 25,450 people.  Also included within this radius are several schools, parks and industrial areas.\n\nThe facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario was evaluated in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The alternative release scenario selected was that of a 3/16 inch diameter opening in a valve, gasket, flexible tubing, or piping occurring inside the enclosed Storage/Unloading Room or Chlorine Feed Room.  .  Using the guidance for alternative release scenarios of chlorine USEPA RMP Comp and without taking passive mitigation of the building into consideration, this chlorine gas release would result in a release rate of 3.0 pounds of chlorine per minute for a period of 30 minutes, resulting in a 90 pound gas release from the building. The reference tables in USEPA RMP Comp give a distance of less than 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario. The residential population within a 0.1 mile radius of influence of the CMBP Chlorination System is determined to be approximately zero persons.  The radius of influence does go offsite and includes the East River Road, however, it does not encompass any residences, schools, hospitals, parks, or prisons.\n\n\nSection 68.155(c): Accidental Release Prevention Program."

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nUSEPA\u0092s Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under Section 68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe Greater Cincinnati Water Works, Charles M. Bolton Plant (CMBP) utilizes more than a threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in Section 68.150. The initial submittal was filed in June 1999. The next required submittal will be in June 2029. Public employees are covered under the State of Ohio\u0092s Public Employee Risk Reduction Program (PERRP), which has adopted by reference the requirements of OSHA\u0092s (PSM) Standard.  Based on the March 1999 revised USEPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) (EPA 550-B-98-010), the Charles M. Bolton Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and the worst case release scenario impacts public receptors.  Therefore, the Charles M. Bolton Plant Chlorination Facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the RMP Regulation.  \n\nUSEPA\u0092s RMP Rule requires that covered"
