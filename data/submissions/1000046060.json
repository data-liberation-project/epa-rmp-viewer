Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Oakwood Facility in Oakwood, Texas.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Management of Change provisions ensures that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\r\n\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\r\n\r\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\r\n\r\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to learn more about our latest information on emergency response for the county.  We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."

This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Oakwood facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.\r\n\r\nOur Emergency Action Plan includes specific instructions for employees and contract personnel to follow in the event of an accidental release.  Activation of this plan will place in motion a series of events specifically designed to minimize the impact of the release on our employees, surrounding community and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Oakwood Facility is located northeast of Oakwood, Texas in Freestone County. The Oakwood facility is a natural gas liquid (NGL) storage and transfer facility. NGL is stored at\r\nthe site prior to sending the NGL to a sales pipeline. The Oakwood Facility currently consists of six (6) 30,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks, two unloading stations, and piping components.\r\nTrucks unloading NGL will also be located at the facility and may be full of NGL while on site, but not stored at the facility.  Liquids are brought to the facility via truck and are unloaded into the on site storage"
