This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Oakwood facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.\n\n\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan includes specific instructions for employees and contract personnel to follow in the event of an accidental release.  Activation of this plan will place in motion a series of events specifically designed to minimize the impact of the release on our employees, surrounding community and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe Oakwood Facility is located northeast of Oakwood, Texas in Freestone County. The Oakwood facility is a natural gas liquid (NGL) storage and transfer facility. NGL is stored at\n\nthe site prior to sending the NGL to a sales pipeline. The Oakwood Facility currently consists of six (6) 30,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks, two unloading stations, and piping components.\n\nTrucks unloading NGL will also be located at the facility and may be full of NGL while on site, but not stored at the facility.  Liquids are brought to the facility via truck and are unloaded into the on site storage"

As such, the total amount of regulated substance stored on site cannot be more than the total capacity of the on site tanks.  The Oakwood Facility is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nWe have several mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  Essentially, the facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes/regulations.  This liquefied petroleum facility is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state laws.  Also, the Oakwood facility has in place an active Process Safety Management program in accordance with CFR 29 1910.119.\n\n\n\nWe have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Freestone County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Oakwood facility within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Oakwood facility with the Oakwood Volunteer Fire Department.

Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n\n\nThe Management of Change provisions ensures that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\n\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\n\n\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n\n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to learn more about our latest information on emergency response for the county.
