New employees are trained by an experienced employee in the area of their job description.  The new employee will be expected to familiarize themselves with our safety policies and procedures through on the job training and/or written policies.\n\n     Attebury, Claude (West).  The primary activity is NH3 receiving, storage and distribution for sale to farmers.  We provide employees with rubber gloves, goggles and rubber suits for their safety while handling NH3.  Two-way radios are used to keep management informed while nurse tanks are being filled.  One employee is on the Claude Volunteer Fire Department, so we could have an emergency team on site in a short time.  Safety and maintenance are always stressed to keep accidents to a minimum.  We have had no accidents in the past five years.\n\n     Our facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29.CFR 1910.38.  We have provided local authorities with the emergency plan and emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required by SARA Title III.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are used to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific recommendations for safety implementation at this time.\n\n     The maximum quantity of NH3 stored at this facility is one 12,000 gallon tank at 54,000 lbs."
