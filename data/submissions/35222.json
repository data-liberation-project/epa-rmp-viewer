      "SummaryText": "Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Winter Garden's facility's tank farm, cold rooms, blend rooms and freeze tunnel. The function of the high-pressure receiver is to hold the system operating charge or the ammonia surge capacity and to form a liquid seal for the system.  The ammonia receiver for the Main plant system is a vertical tank with an 8000-pound capacity, and is located outside of the main plant machine room along the south wall.  Receiver for the Annex system is one (1) vertical tank with a capacity of approximately 10300 pounds, and is located outside of the Annex machine room along the north wall. The facility processes oranges and packages juice in bulk (55 gal drums and tanker trucks) and for retail in frozen cans (12, 16 and 48 oz).  Orange waste is processed into animal feed.  The facility has not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the past 5 years.  Training is conducted during the whole year as part of the monthly safety meetings.  Annual drills are conducted using both company and non-company personnel to ensure timely and accurate responses should an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia occur. Improvements are made every year to assist in preventing ammonia releases. Changes to the main system will be completed in December 2004."
