      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nAt the Martin Gas Sales, LLC (Martin) Truck Rack facility, we handle propane and a mixture of propylene and propane, which are considered hazardous flammable gases by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make propane and propylene valuable as a fuel also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle propane and propylene, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nOur facility is a propane and propylene storage and distribution facility.  The primary purpose is to distribute propane to both residential and industrial customers.  Propane is used by our customers as a fuel.  Propane is received by via truck transport or pipeline and stored in eleven 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks.  Propane is distributed to customers by delivery trucks (bob"

      "SummaryText": "tails), truck transports, and pipeline. A propylene and propane mixture is used as a fuel at the Diamond Shamrock gas processing facility.  The mixture is received via truck transport and is stored in three 50,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks and distributed via pipeline. The pipeline runs between the Truck Rack facility and a Diamond Shamrock facility.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors. \n\nThe regulated substances handled at our facility is propane and propylene.  The maximum quantity of propane that can be stored at this facility is 1,100,000 pounds in eleven 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of propylene/propane mixture that can be stored at this facility is 540,000 pounds in three 50,000-gallon storage tanks. \n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nMartin has incorporated a policy for the facility that limits the maximum filling capacity of all propane and propylene storage tanks to 80% at 60\u00baF.  Therefore, our worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 180,000 pounds of a propylene/propane mixture from a 50,000-gallon storage tank.\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case rel"

Based on 180,000 pounds of propylene released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.5-mile from the location of the storage tank.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternate release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is a the failure of a flexible transfer hose.  The transfer hose connects to iron piping.  Excess flow valves at the storage tank and truck transport function to stop the flow of propylene out of the storage tank and truck transport.  Therefore, the release would be limited to 510 pounds of propylene/propane mixture, the amount in the transfer hose and iron piping.\n\nIn this alternative release scenario, the entire contents of the transfer hose and piping would be released before facility personnel could implement actions to stop the release.  RMP*Comp\u00bf estimates the distance endpoint for the release of 510 pounds of propane to no longer pose a hazard to the public as 0.04 mile.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nMartin complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR 68.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What if checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our processes, Martin maintains written operation procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\n\nMartin has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the processes. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMartin carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.

The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\n Compliance Audit\n\nMartin conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMartin promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of propane or propylene.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIt is our belief at Martin, that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Our company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, Martin hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities. We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of propane or propylene occur.\n\t\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.
