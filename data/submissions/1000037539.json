Site programs, procedures and management practices are in place to support our organizations commitment.  Progress is constantly assessed against our commitment and corrective actions are taken whenever necessary.\n\n\n\nAlthough the primary focus of the facility is on accidental release prevention, the site also possesses and maintains strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  The combination of prevention programs and emergency response capabilities is used to ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as, the protection of the environment.\n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n?A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program regulation;\n\n?A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases;\n\n?An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n\n?An overview of our Emergency Response program;\n\n?A five-year history of accidental release of chemicals regulated by the RMP rule;\n\n?An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe DuPont Chambers Works facility first opened in the early 1900s as a dye manufacturing plant.

These scenarios were developed using the guidance supplied by the EPA and technical data modeling.  Scenario information has been used on Chambers Works for many years as part of our process safety management program.  In the past we have modeled potential releases and analyzed the results to help the site continuously improve processes and reduce risk.
