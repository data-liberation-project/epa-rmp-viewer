Equistar Chemicals owns and  operates three  basically identical polypropylene manufacturing units at  the  Bayport  facility.  These  systems  produce  mainly homopolymer  with some copolymer production capability.  The loop  reactors  in  this  process  are  fed  with  the  main feedstock,  propylene,  as  well as  smaller  quantities  of ethylene,  donor,  catalyst and mineral oils.  Polypropylene polymer is then formed and passes through a steamer to strip residual  hydrocarbons.  A nitrogen dryer is used to  remove any  remaining moisture and the finished product is  shipped as flake or goes to an extruder for pelletizing.\r\nThe  Catalloy  unit  is  a  multipurpose  unit  capable   of producing  homopolymer, copolymer, and terpolymer. Ethylene, propylene, and butene are the main feedstocks to the reactor depending on the desired type of product. Smaller quantities of  catalyst  donor and mineral oil are also  added  to  the reactors.  The  resulting polymers formed pass  through  the steamer  and  dryer,  and the finishe"
