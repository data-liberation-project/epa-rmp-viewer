The Facility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe Facility's owner, management, and employees of Gavilon Fertilizer LLC. are \r\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \r\nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain firsthand knowledge of the site. Employees are required to hold periodic safety meetings and additional training is conducted on various sections of the facility's Process Safety Management plan as required. The Facility has prepared an internal written emergency action plan which includes ammonia releases.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\r\n\r\nII.   Facility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to manufacture and distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming industry. Ammonia is received, stored, and used for production of  liquid fertilizer solutions and is an important source of nitrogen for local agricultural crops.\r\n \r\nThe maximum quantity that can be stored in the facility's stationary storage tanks is approximately 474,000 pounds. The Facility may receive ammonia in rail cars for use in polyphosphate fertilizer production.  It is not a practice to hold the car(s) any longer than is necessary. The more typical method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds of ammonia. The process is considered a batch process and operates intermittently.\r\n\r\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\r\n   \r\nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards Institute Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia \r\nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2.  The Facility also has a Process \r\nSafety  Management Program that dovetails with the RMP. It is Management"
