The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filedas required by ARP and CalARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta operates and maintains a wastewater treatment plant, located above the east bank of the Sacramento River in the City of Mt. Shasta, CA in Siskiyou County, and uses chlorine, an RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS. There are two full-time employees at this site.  The plant is normally manned on the day shift Monday through Friday, and a telephone dialer system alerts operators to alarm conditions when the plant is not manned.  \n\nChlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric trolley hoist, and stored on scales inside the building.  The chlorine is used for disinfection of wastewater effluent prior to discharge.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a to"

Shasta that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Mt. Shasta has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and has plans to establish a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at the City of Mt. Shasta which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include the City's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nPassive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.

Shasta has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA GISO Section 5189 covering the disinfection process at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the City's operations at this facility. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include improvements in operating procedures, installing a wind sock,  sealing off the doorway connecting  the chlorine storage room and the rest of the Operations Building, and improving the egress of the ton container storage room by adding a personnel door with panic hardware..\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta's Emergency Response plan applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Siskiyou County Public Health Department, the agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.
