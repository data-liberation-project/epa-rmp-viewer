BP Solvay has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Deer Park, Texas polyethylene plant.  The plant's program complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a RMP Plan summary describing the risk management program at BP Solvay.  This plan is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 though 40 CFR 68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the RMP in place at BP Solvay.\n\n2.0   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBP Solvay is committed to the safety of their employees, the public and to the preservation of the environment and has a program in place to prevent releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, BP Solvay emergency response actions are in place to help prevent or minimize injury to the public or the environment.\n\n3.0   Facility Process and Regulated Substances\nBP Solvay manufactures polyethylene resins for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications such as plastic milk bottles, pipes, and cups.\n  \nThe polyethylene manufacturing process uses ethylene as the basic building block for producing polyethylene.  Isobutane is used as a carrier solvent for the polyethylene process.  Propane is inherent to the polyethylene manufacturing processes.  \n\n4.0   Offsite Consequence Analysis\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on the polyethylene facility.  The subject analysis consisted of worst-case scenario(s) and alternative release scenario"

      "SummaryText": "(s).\n\nThere is no toxic RMP compounds at the polyethylene facility; therefore, toxic worst-case and toxic alternative scenarios were not considered.\n \nOne worst-case scenario was completed for all flammable RMP compounds. The scenario is a release of 636,000 pounds of isobutane from two twin isobutane storage tanks and associated piping, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The pressure effects from this scenario would reach the offsite industrial endpoints but it would not reach residential populations.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is considered a conservative analysis.  It is based worst-case meteorological conditions proposed by RMP guidance.  In addition, the worst-case scenario did not consider (credit) any existing safety systems or mitigation activities.  \n\nTwo Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were completed for flammable RMP compounds.  The first is a release of ethylene from a metering yard header resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The second is a BLEVE of a polyethylene reactor containing 58,000 pounds of isobutane.  The pressure / thermal effects from these scenarios may reach offsite industrial endpoints but not residential populations.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios are based on more typical atmospheric conditions. \n\n5.0   Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe polyethylene processes are currently covered by the PSM standard.  As such, a Program Level 3 prevention program is in place.  The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at BP Solvay.\n\n5.1   Safety Information \nBP Solvay maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the polyethylene processes.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled at the plant.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable c"

Checklists include items to help ensure that BP Solvay operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n5.3   Operating Procedures \nBP Solvay operating procedures are maintained under an ISO9000 program.  As such we are required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to (1) train employees and contractors and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\n5.4   Training \nBP Solvay trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.  A training documentation file is maintained to help ensure that refresher training is provided, as necessary.\n\n5.5   Maintenance \nBP Solvay properly maintains the process equipment.  The maintenance program includes (1) procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks, (2) worker training in the maintenance procedures, and (3) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails.\n\n5.6   Management of Change \nBP Solvay has a program in place to document changes to facility processes.  A significant change in process chemicals, technology, equipment, practices or procedures prompt implementation of this program.  The program is designed to (1) evaluate the impact of the change on the process, (2) update records on the process and (3) ensure that workers are informed and trained on any significant changes.\n\n5.7   Pre-startup Review \nBP Solvay performs audits on a new process or an existing process that has undergone a modification affecting the safety information.  This review is"
