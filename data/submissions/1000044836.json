      "SummaryText": "A. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances handled\r\n\r\nGenpak LLC - Longview, Texas (Genpak) produces polystyrene foam food trays and containers. The process takes polystyrene pellets through an extrusion process where a nuclient and blowing agent (isopentane) is added. The sheets are then thermoformed and cut to produce the final product.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the manufacturing process, isopentane is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified by EPA regulations. Genpak has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\r\n\r\nIsopentane is delivered to the facility via tank truck. The tank truck is unloaded into an aboveground storage tank using a transfer pump.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of isopentane vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer. Isopentane is pumped from the storage tank to the pump room where the pressure is increased so it can be injected into one of the four extruders.\r\n\r\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Genpak\r\n\r\nGenpak is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Hazard Communication Plan, and Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\r\n\r\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA, RMP regulations Genpak performed the following offsite consequence analyses.\r\n\r\n- One worst-case release scenario for isopentane.\r\n- One alternate-case release scenario for isopentane. \r\n\r\nGenpak used the EPA RMP*COMP to calculate the estimated release rates and to determine the distance to the appropriate flammable endpoints.\r\n\r\nD.

Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving a covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in a covered process. Operating procedures are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.\r\n\r\nOperating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including initial system startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and conditions that require, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.
