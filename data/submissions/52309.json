Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) is co-owned by JEA and Florida Power and Light Company.  The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plant Manager retains ultimate responsibility for these procedures, while specific duties are delegated to other employees.\n\nB. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe SJRPP is a two-unit power generation plant located at 11201 New Berlin Road, northeast of downtown Jacksonville, Florida, two miles north of the State Road 9-A and Hecksher Drive intersection.  SJRPP adds chlorine as a biocide to the makeup water and has installed an anhydrous ammonia supply process for the selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) and the SO3 Control process.\n\nSJRPP stores liquefied chlorine in up to twenty one-ton containers at the Makeup Water Chlorination process.  Up to ten containers may be connected to the process, while up to ten additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The maximum total inventory in the process is 40,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The Chlorination system for Makeup Water is enclosed in a building that meets passive mitigation requirements and has active mitigation in the form of a chemical scrubber that is activated by the chlorine detectors to mitigate a potentially catastrophic chlorine release.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia supply process includes two storage tanks with a capacity of 360,000 lbs. each, administratively controlled to 290,000 lbs. (80% of vessel capacity).  The sum of these tanks (580,000 lbs.) exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The tanks store the ammonia as a gas liquefied under pressure.  Opera"

      "SummaryText": "ting pressure is expected to vary from 80 to 300 psig.  Vaporizers maintain the desired pressure and temperature of the ammonia as delivered to the SCR ammonia injection grid and the SO3 control process.\n\nC. Description of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBoth processes at SJRPP exceed the chemical threshold quantities for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and are therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places both SJRPP processes in the Program 3 level.  The SJRPP facility will use its existing PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  \n\nThe SJRPP has a program in place to comply with the PSM Standard.   The original PSM Program was reviewed and updated in conjunction with the ammonia process installation.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination and ammonia processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination and ammonia processes to ensure consistency of operation and to minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan, which requires all chlorination and ammonia equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will reduce the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the SJRPP Safety/Security Department.  These were reviewed and updated to ensure that non-routine work performed on the chlorine and ammonia processes is addressed in the procedures.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information and the development of updated Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will help to ensure that the equipment meets the appropriate chlorination and ammonia industry standards and tha"

      "SummaryText": "t accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff has performed  initial and revalidated Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the chlorination process and performed the initial PHA of the Ammonia process in January 2008.\n\nD. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe SJRPP has had no accidental releases of chlorine or ammonia in the last five years.\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThe SJRPP has an Emergency Evacuation Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine, entitled \"SJRPP Procedure for Chlorine Emergency Response\" (SJRPP Procedure SF-039).  A similar procedure for ammonia releases has been prepared and was implemented prior to the first ammonia delivery.  The current plan has been coordinated with Moran Environmental Recovery, a private company whose service is the repair and clean-up of chemical spills.  If needed, additional assistance can be obtained from the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSJRPP will implement recommendations resulting from the initial PHA of the Ammonia Supply Process and the revalidation PHA of the Makeup Chlorination Process."
