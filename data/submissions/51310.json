Spring Mill is also included in the Emergency Response Plan maintained by the Blair County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan consists of training and planning to prepare for, prevent, and mitigate the release of chemicals from the covered processes.  As it applies to the covered process and chemical, the program makes use of the multi-point chemical detection and alarm system and the Bleach Plant operating personnel.  Bleach Plant personnel were chosen for this task for three primary reasons:\n\n    - There are three Bleach Plant personnel in the mill at all times, and they work in the immediate vicinity of the covered process and chemical.\n    - They operate the ClO2 generation, storage, and usage equipment as part of their regular job responsibilities.\n    - They posses more training on, and working knowledge of, the covered process than anyone else in the mill.\n\nThe plan dictates the nature and extent of our actions based on the magnitude of the release, as indicated by the detection system.  All Bleach Plant personnel have been trained in the procedures called for in the Emergency Action Plan, as have all Pulp Mill/Utilities Shift Supervisors.\n\nIn addition to in-plant activities, the Emergency Action Plan contains provisions to notify outside personnel and obtain emergency response assistance as necessary depending on the type and severity of the event.  All necessary assistance (hazmat, fire, ambulance, police, etc.) would be contacted by dialing 911 and would be coordinated by the Blair County 911 Emergency Operations Center.                                                  \n\nThe Emergency Contact listed in our current RMP is Chris Powers, Pulp Mill Superintendent.  He is an employee of Appleton who is knowledgeable about the site, aware of all emergency plans, a"

      "SummaryText": "ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment portion of the 112\u00ae rule requires facility owners or operators to prepare \u00bfworst-case\u00bf and \u00bfalternative\u00bf release scenarios as appropriate to the operations.  From the release scenarios, facilities are then to determine offsite impacts using specified offsite consequence analysis (OCA) parameters for worst-case releases and more realistic parameters for alternative releases.\n\nAS DESCRIBED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY:\n\nThe WORST-CASE SCENARIO involves the release of the largest quantity of a listed toxic substance that is estimated to generate the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint defined in the 112\u00ae regulation.  The probability that a worst-case release might occur or the possible causes of such a release are not considered.\n\nThe ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO involves an accidental release that is \u00bfmore likely\u00bf to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Scenarios to consider include transfer hose splits or uncoupling, process piping failures, process vessel or pump cracks and failures, vessel overfilling and spill or overpressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks, and shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill.\n\nSpring Mill prepared worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario analyses (Sections 2 and 3 in the RMP Report, respectively) for ClO2, based on the requirements found in the 112\u00ae rule.  The OCA of each chemical release was analyzed using appropriate air dispersion analysis and modeling techniques.\n\nWHAT IS AIR DISPERSION MODELING?\n\nAir dispersion modeling is the use of a computer to simulate the spread of air pollutants.  Dispersion modeling can be used to determine the movement and concentration of toxic gases emitted from an accidental release.\n\nTo determine the OCA for worst-case and alternative releases of ClO2, Spring Mill used the most-recent version (version 1.07) of US EPA\u00bfs air dispersion model as follows:\n\n    - RM"

In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release.  The completion of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements essentially satisfies the 112\u00ae Prevention Program requirements for ClO2 in the Program-level 3 process.\n\nSafeguarding the public from accidental releases through an effective Prevention Program is an important component of the 112\u00ae rule.  Spring Mill has been diligent in its completion of the Program 3 Prevention Program requirements for:\n\n    - Process safety information: Spring Mill compiled written and electronic process safety information that is completed prior to conducting any process hazard analysis required by the rule.  This written information enables Spring Mill and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances.  Minimum information includes hazard data such as that found on a Material Safety Data Sheet, technology information, and equipment information.\n\n    - Process hazard analysis: A hazard evaluation has been performed by an experienced team to identify, assess, and control the hazards involved in each of the covered areas.  The HAZOP/\u00bfWhat If\u00bf methodologies were used for determining and evaluating the hazards of the process.  The analysis addressed the hazards of the process, the identification of any previous incident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate applicat"

      "SummaryText": "The Appleton Papers Inc. (hereafter \u00bfAppleton\u00bf) Spring Mill pulp and paper mill, located in Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania, has been in operation at its current location since 1865.  Appleton itself was founded in 1907, and has earned a reputation as an innovative producer of carbonless, thermal, and other specialty papers used in a variety of commercial printing applications.  Our 530-employee workforce is comprised of production, maintenance, engineering, technical, clerical, and management personnel.  Many of our employees have been with us for 25 years or more.  On March 21, 2001, Spring Mill achieved the OSHA VPP Star Site status.  Spring Mill also became an ISO 14001 registered facility on March 27, 2001.  We are proud of our facility and the stability of our workforce.\n\nThe Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean Air Act Section 112\u00ae, codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances include 77 toxic chemicals with TQs ranging from 500 lbs. to 20,000 lbs., while the 63 flammable substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nSpring Mill uses one chemical, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) that is stored in a quantity exceeding its TQ.\n\nChlorine dioxide is a yellowish-green to orange gas with a pungent odor.  Chlorine dioxide is manufactured on site at Spring Mill and is used to bleach pulp that will be made into paper.\n\nThe TQ for ClO2 is 1,000 pounds and the maximum amount stored on site is 5,400 pounds.  As part of Spring Mill\u00bfs commitment to the environment, in 1997 a 2 million-dollar air pollution control system was installed as an upgrade to the former pollution control system to control process emissions of ClO2 at the Roaring Spring facility.\n\nThe major Clean Air"

The emergency response team will provide an immediate and rapid response and emergency shutdowns systems and procedures will be activated.  Bleach Plant personnel will shutdown the affect equipment via the distributed control system (DCS).\n\nMODELING LIMITATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAir-dispersion models are limited in their ability to accurately predict the impact of a chemical release.  Their limitations increase as the complexity of the topography surrounding the release site increases.  In general, the EPA-recommended models used for the Spring Mill worst-case and alternative release scenarios have likely over-estimated the impact distance, because of several complicating conditions:\n\n    - The model assumes that the total amount of chlorine dioxide released is pure gas, when it is actually a 1% solution in water.  Thus, the chlorine dioxide would not be released instantly to the air, but gradually from the solution to the air as the solution warms and the equilibrium solubility decreases. \n    - Surrounding the ClO2 storage tanks and associated system piping are large industrial buildings and structures.  These features disrupt and redirect airflow, but the models used assume winds are steady and moving in a straight line.\n    - Beyond plant property, buildings, structures, vegetation, and terrain features also serve to disrupt and redirect airflow.\n    - The chemicals emitted are assumed to have no reaction with the ground, other chemicals, or other potential release conditions.  However, it is likely that a release of ClO2 will deposit on the ground and other surfaces as it disperses from a ground-level source.  ClO2 may also be neutraliz"
