Zillah facility is a fruit processing and cold storage facility located outside the City of Zillah, County of Yakima, State of Washington.  Baker Produce, Inc. has developed a Risk Management Program in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's final Rule 40 CFR Part 68. The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThe top priority of Baker Produce, Inc. is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community. In this effort, Baker Produce, Inc. has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe facility has two engine rooms, 21 controlled atmosphere rooms and 3 common storage rooms. These processes utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program"
