THE FACILITY POLICY\n \nTHE OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES OF TRIANGLE AGRONOMY SERVICES, LLC ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMANTION\n\n THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILTY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n \n ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, AND STORED IN NURSE TANKS AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED  WOULD BE 88,000 POUNDS IN 20 1,000 GALLON NURSE TANKS FILLED TO 85% CAPACITY. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY  HANDLED WOULD BE THE DISTRIBUTION OF 1 NURSE TANK AT 4400 POUNDS.\n\nA.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANYHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF ALL NURSE TANKS AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 88,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF ALL THE NURSE TANKS AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .98 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENERIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 1.5 INCH HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .46 MILES.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE  PROVISIONS OF \" SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U. S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR"
