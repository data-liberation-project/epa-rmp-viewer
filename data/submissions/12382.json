Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n1.5  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\tThe processes at the Calvert City Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the site. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\n\tIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Calvert City Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\t\t(\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms in selected areas \n\t\t(\tChemical-specific detectors with alarms in selected areas\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n* Process relief valves"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n1.4.10\t\tManagement of Change\n\nThe Calvert City Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n1.4.11\t\tIncident Investigation\n\nISP promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, plant evacuation plans and accounting for plant personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and postincident cleanup and decontamination requirements.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or facilities. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with the Marshall County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, the ISP Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. \n\n1.8   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nISP's Calvert City Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting suggestions from the workers.  The Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned during the next 5 years:\n* Revised process instrumentation and/or controls for various storage tanks\n* Hydrocarbon release detection system in the lower vinyl ethers unit and the Gantrez AN Building\n* Improved spill control dikes in the tank farm\n\n\n1\n\n\n1"

The following are the RMP substances we handle in covered processes:  Acetylene, Hydrogen, Propane, Vinyl Acetate, Cyclohexylamine, Vinyl Methyl Ether, Ammonia, Ethyl Vinyl Ether, and Ethylamine.\n\n1.3  Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Calvert City Plant performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  ISP does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the ISP Plant.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help improve the community emergency response plan.  We have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.  Additional information can be obtained by calling the Environmental or Safety Departments at (270) 395-4165.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, management will correct the deficiency, in a timely manner, or  management of change will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.
