This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of liquid starter fertilizer 10-34-0, 6-24-6, 9-30-0, and shipments of combinations of those grades of fertilizer.  We have two regulated substances covered by 40 CFR Part 68 at our facility: anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to react with phosphoric acid and other raw materials to produce liquid fertilizer.  Aqueous ammonia solutions of varying concentrations are produced from anhydrous ammonia and water for sale.  Because the aqueous ammonia solutions can exceed 20% ammonia concentration, aqueous ammonia is included in the site's covered processes.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at our facility is 135,150 pounds and the maximum inventory of aqua ammonia is 347,655 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThis facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place for our covered processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Andersons Gibbon facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs asso"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Andersons Gibbon facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\nThe Andersons Gibbon facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Andersons Gibbon facility carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at The Anderson"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The Andersons Gibbon facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Andersons Gibbon facility conducts audits on a periodic basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Routine safety and environmental audits are conducted by the HS&E manager.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Andersons Gibbon facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Andersons Gibbon facility believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

There have been no RMP-reportable accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe Andersons Gibbon facility is a non-responding facility with respect to the RMP chemicals on site.  It has a written emergency action plan which addresses the required information for non-responding facilities. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  Buffalo County Emergency Services is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  The Gibbon Fire Department is the first responder to any incident.  One of the plant employees is a HAZMAT trained member of the Gibbon Volunteer Fire Department.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe facility has identified additional safety measures for covered processes which will be implemented over the next few years at the site.\r\n\r\n7.
