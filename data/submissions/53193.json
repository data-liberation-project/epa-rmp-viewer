Hutchinson Technology Incorporated's (HTI) accidental release prevention program involves policies and procedures that integrate technology, engineering, written procedures, and management practices to allow safe operation of the chlorine system.  HTI follows all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program.  These are summarized in Part (D) below.  HTI's emergency response program includes responses of plans that are coordinated with emergency activities available in the community.  The emergency response program, summarized in Part (F) below, is in compliance with the USEPA's Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB.  HTI uses a chemical process for etching stainless steel and stainless steel/polyimide/copper clad sheets.  These sheets are eventually processed into computer suspension assemblies used in the hard disk drive industry.  HTI's Eau Claire facility uses only one chemical included in the regulations: chlorine.  It is used in the following process:  etchers use chlorine for oxidation purposes to improve the performance of its etchant.\n\nChlorine is supplied to the etching process to maintain the etchant solution (iron chloride) in optimal etching condition.  The chlorine is received as a liquid in DOT specified metal tanks which are stored in two specially-engineered totally enclosed hold bunkers (half submerged below ground).  These bunkers can hold a total of eight 1-ton chlorine tanks (four in each bunker), but only one tank feeds the system at a time.  The liquid chlorine flows from the tanks to a vaporizer system that converts the liquid to a gas (vapor).  The chlorine gas then flows to the mixing/holding etchant tanks (called sumps) where it enters the solution to chemically maintain the etchant.  Chlorine is fed into the etchant sumps in a controlled manner by sensors that signal the feed rate.  The storage bunkers, vaporizer, and delivery system contain multiple controls for redundancy, a chl"

An emergency response team is on call 24 hours a day to respond should there be a leak.\n\nC.  The off-site consequences analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios called ?worst case release? and ?alternative release?.  The worst case scenario is defined by the USEPA as a scenario where ?the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes? due to an unspecified accident or failure.  This scenario does not depend on how or why it occurred and does not depend on whether it has ever been observed to have happened anywhere.  The requirements do not allow for any control of chlorine to be assumed except for a control that is ?passive? (not human, electrical, or otherwise actively activated).  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario,? but there are no other requirements as to defining the quantity released, except that active controls can be included thereby reducing the likelihood of  a release occurring or reducing the quantity that could potentially be released.  Consequently, HTI determined the alternative release scenario would be one that could reasonably occur  (even if it had not been observed) and would be one where a chlorine release could be controlled.\n\nHTI?s worst case scenario for chlorine is the release of one chlorine tank contents.  HTI?s alternative release scenario is a valve failure in the storage pit releasing one pound of chlorine of which 0.75 pound is captured and controlled by the scrubber and 0.25 pound is released to the environment.  \n\nD. The HTI accidental release prevention program is part of a long-established operating management system.  The prevention program contains the following key components:\n\n-- High level training for personnel involved in the chlorine system and operators of the etchant\n-- Pre"

This special ventilation enhances employee safety by reducing chlorine exposure.\n\nE. No accidental release of chlorine has occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nF.  The HTI emergency response program is part of a long-established Emergency Management System.  This program includes an emergency response team, decision process, response procedures, and notification plan.  The emergency response program has been coordinated with the City of Eau Claire Fire Department who is the key component of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  The program also includes emergency response training and procedures for use, inspection, testing, and maintenance of emergency response equipment.  Emergency operation and response procedure are reviewed on a periodic basis.  Chlorine-specific exposure response steps are part of the program and these include: (1) awareness  training of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, and (2) chlorine tank specific emergency repair training.\n\nG. In October 2008, HTI Eau Claire, in conjunction with HTI?s Minnesota facility, conducted process hazard analysis for the chlorine system to improve safety and consistency in the process system, equipment, and chlorine operations."
