The Springfield Water and Sewer Commission has prepared and updated this accident release prevention program in response to the Risk Management Plan Rule as promulgated and amended (April 9, 2004 - 69 FR 18819) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Commission has followed the procedures set forth in the rule and utilized guidance materials provided by EPA.  In addition, an emergency response plan relating to an accidental chlorine release at the West Parish Filters Drinking Water Treatment Plant outlines emergency response procedures at the plant and coordination with local emergency response services.\n\nB.  The stationary source this Risk Management Plan (RMP) applies to is the chlorination facility located at the West Parish Filters Drinking Water Treatment Plant in Westfield, Massachusetts.  The RMP regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine which is used for primary disinfection of the finished water.  This water is the sole source for all communities served by the Commission.  The chlorine building is comprised of two separate rooms: (1) a chlorine handling room containing one ton cylinders with vacuum regulators, scales, electric hoist, chlorine gas sensor alarms, automatic switchover and manual ventilation system, and (2) a chlorination room housing four floor mounted gas regulators, ejectors, chlorine gas sensor alarms and feed water pipes.  A secure pad adjacent to the building provides space for additional inventory and empty cylinder storage.  During normal operations four cylinders are connected, two on-line and two on stand-by.  Both rooms have chlorine gas sensors with alarms connected to the plant computer system in the main building.  The facility is staffed twenty-four (24) hours a day by a certified operator.\n\nC.  The general accident release program is comprised of several interrelated elements.  The operators have received a high level of training through on the job instruction, attendence of appropriate mandato"

      "SummaryText": "ry courses and seminars, and a mandatory certified on-site refresher course given by the facility's chlorine supplier vendor annually.  The chemical feed system was last updated in 1992 with the latest controls designed to simplify dosage and to minimize accidental releases.  The operators follow a preventative maintenance program to avert sudden equipment breakdowns.  Written operating procedures are available to the operators.  The most recent hazard review of equipment and review of safety procedures was performed on May 21, 2009.  A B-Kit is available on site to patch and plug leaks.  Full face respirators are worn by facility personnel during cylinder change outs.  Training is conducted concerning the awareness of the hazardous properties of chlorine and for the chlorine sensor alarm systems which incorporate both audible and visual alarms at the storage site as well as the plant's main computer alarm system.  Operators have received Hazardous Material (HazMat) Training.\n\nD.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the facility in the previous five years (June 2004 to June 2009).\n\nE.  The treatment plant has an emergency response plan which provides both plant and community response personnel contact numbers.  The Westfield Fire Department provides annual site visits to review and update its emergency information.  The Westfield Local Emergency Planning Committee has been given a copy of this plan.  An emergency response excersise was conducted in October of 2000 to familiarize facility personnel and community first responders with emergency response procedures.  Annually the facility conducts refresher training in the use of emergency response equipment and the emergency response plan.  Starting in 2007 the facility instituted an Emergency Response Training Program to instruct facility personnel in NIMS and ICS Training.  All personnel are trained to the NIMS IS-700 and ICS 100 level.  Supervisory personnel have been trained to the ICS-200 level."

      "SummaryText": "  Monthly communications drills are conducted between facility control room staff and the Westfield 911 center via a two-way radio.\n\nF.  After the 1997 review only one change was recommended and implemented.  The ventilation system was switched from an automatic system to a manual one to ensure that a major leak would remain contained insided the building rather than be ventilated to the environment.  Following September 11, 2001, security bars were installed on all windows in the chlorine building.  All new cylinder regulators were installed in 2002.  The use of magnetic full/empty signs for cylinder's was instituted in 2002.  Also, the Commission requires prior authorization for vendors before a delivery is made.  Video surveillance cameras were recently installed in the buiding for enhanced security."
