Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant is committed to the protection of its employees, neighbors, and the community.  This objective will never be compromised and is the most basic obligation of all personnel at the plant.  We will meet or exceed all applicable laws and regulations, and strive for continual improvement in our Environment, Health, and Safety performance.  We recognize our responsibility to provide a positive impact on the community.  This is accomplished by the prevention of hazardous exposures, injuries, fires, environmental releases, or damage to property.  We are firmly committed to the protection of the health and welfare of our employees and the surrounding community.  This objective will be accomplished by proper design, operation, and maintenance of the facility, and supported by rigorous training and safety reviews.  Our emergency response plan is based upon a combination of government and company requirements.  Local response capabilities have been reviewed to ensure a coordinated response with all appropriate agencies.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying local fire and police departments, government agencies, as well as any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.       The Charlotte Plant and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant manufactures latex emulsions.  These emulsions are used in a variety of products such as latex paint, adhesives, paper coatings and textiles. Among the raw materials used to make these emulsions are Aqueous Ammonia (28 wt%), Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate, which are regulated under the EPA RMP Rule.  All products made at the plant are non-hazardous, and contain very low concentrations of the regulated chemicals, such that they no longer present a toxicity hazar"

The capacity of the Aqueous Ammonia (28 wt%) Tank is 10,000 gallons, the Acrylonitrile storage tank is 12,000 gallons, and the Vinyl Acetate storage tank is 60,000 gallons.  Unloading, storage, and manufacturing systems have all the necessary equipment for the safe unloading and use of these materials. \n\n Access to the Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant is restricted to authorized employees, and authorized contractors.  Persons seeking to perform work at the plant must pass substance abuse screening and background checks and are required to undergo training in the plant safety rules.\n\n\n\n 3.       General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps The Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant complies with both the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the EPA RMP rule, as well as with all applicable State rules and regulations.  The Plant is designed and maintained to both recognized engineering standards and more rigorous company standards.  The process is computer controlled, and equipped with redundant sensors, alarms and interlocks designed to ensure proper operation and prevent releases. We have written procedures covering all aspects of operation, including abnormal situations and how to correct them.  We review all equipment and process changes for safety, health, and environmental impact.  A preventive maintenance and inspection program is in place to ensure that equipment is operating properly. Plant staff undergoes an extensive training and certification program to ensure that all equipment is operated safely and efficiently.  We also fully investigate any incident to improve our procedures and process in the future. \n\n\n\n4.       Five-Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of Aqueous A"

Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the community plan. The plan includes procedures for public notification of emergencies that may affect the surrounding community.  The site emergency response plan has been designed to meet the requirements of all relevant regulations requiring emergency response plans.  The plan is intended to prevent hazardous material spills, protect the health and well-being of our employees and neighbors, protect the assets of Rohm and Haas and our neighbors, protect the environment, and serve as a reference to responders in the event of an emergency. \n\n\n\n6.       Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Charlotte Plant has conducted risk analysis studies on all processes handling Aqueuous Ammonia, Acrylonitrile and Vinyl Acetate.  As a result of these studies, we have identified a number of ways we can improve our processes to make them safer.  Over the last several years, these changes have included a new computer control system with improved safety features, new & improved storage tanks for Aqueous Ammonia and Acrylonitrile, and a significant reduction in the amount of Acrylonitrile stored on site. Significant changes have also been made to the site security program.  We will continue to review our processes periodically to identify and implement further means of improvement."
