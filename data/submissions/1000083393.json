      "SummaryText": "In addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine processes at the facility, SupHerb Farms has extensive administrative and engineering controls in place to maintain safe operation of the systems. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency response training, a hot work permit program, a lock out/tag out program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, system entry/line break and an RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are prepared for the ammonia and chlorine systems at the facility. \n\nThe SOPs are a big part of the site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nSupHerb Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine systems. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe CALARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility. \n\u00bf\tSupHerb Farms has had no reportable accidental releases of ammonia or chlorine during the past five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response/Action Program\nSupHerb Farms has a written Emergency Response (Action) Plan (EAP) that identifies emergency personnel responsibilities, procedures, evacuation measures and reporting requirements.

These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe CALARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. SupHerb Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system and chlorine wash tank process to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. One safety concern with closed-loop ammonia system or a chlorine cylinder is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The second is a component failure. The SupHerb Farms ammonia and chlorine process has safeties and cutouts that shut down pump components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the ammonia and chlorine processes are equipped with pressure relief valves on pressure vessels and most chlorine cylinders. Additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped. The ammonia pressure relief valves discharge into a diffusion tank of adequate capacity. The chlorine cylinder would release to atmosphere.\n\nThe chlorine system is, for the most part, under less than atmospheric pressure with only the two one-ton cylinders and vacuum regulators operated at above atmospheric pressure. The vacuum regulators will shut off chlorine flow if vacuum is lost anywhere in the delivery piping.\n\nOther safety features at the facility include:\n\u00bf\tAmmonia leak detection in the engine room and in refrigerated areas\n\u00bf\tChlorine release detection in the incoming vegetable wash line area\n\u00bf\tRemote emergency shutdown switches\n\u00bf\tFire sprinklers indoors throughout the facility\n\u00bf\tComponent-specific safety shutdowns\n\u00bf\tPersonnel Monitors\n\u00bf\tMonitoring by personnel"

Fresh  herbs and specialty vegetables are processed through an Instant Quick Freeze (IQF) tunnel. Frozen herbs are packaged for wholesale markets or processed through a paste line. Cold storage is also provided within the warehouse for holding packaged final products. The NAICS Code for the facility is 311411 Frozen Fruit, Juice, and Vegetable Manufacturing.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) is the regulated substance used in the facility's refrigeration system. The refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 19,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling to the cold storage rooms, and processing lines. The cold rooms are used to store finished products ready for shipping.\n\n\nChlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is utilized as a biocide to disinfect the process water in the facility which is used three wash lines. The source of chlorine for the chlorination system during normal operation is a one-ton container. Two one-ton containers may be on site, resulting in a maximum chlorine inventory of 4,000 pounds. At times 150 Lb. bottles may be used when the ton cylinders are running low.\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the SupHerb Farms facility due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as ...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes. An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the"
