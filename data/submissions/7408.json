There are no at-risk populations (e.g., schools, nursing homes, day-care centers, hospitals, prisons, etc.) located within 1.5 miles of the facility.  The closest environmentally sensitive area is the Columbia River. \n\nA. Description of Primary Activities at Facility\n\nGWCC - Pasco is a warehousing and distribution facility only.  No packaging or manufacturing of chemical products occurs at this facility.  Chemical products are received, stored and delivered to customers in closed containers. \n\nB.  Description of Facility Processes\n\nGW- Pasco engages in the following activities:\n\n-- Delivery by truck of chemical products in bulk and nonbulk UN-approved containers\n-- Internal movement of chemical products from the receiving area by forklift [or pallet jack] to and from the designated storage area\n-- Delivery of chemical products to customers\n\nC.  Description of Products/Quantities Handled at Facility\n\nGW - Pasco may store two CAA 112 RMP program chemicals in amounts that exceed threshold quantities:  Chlorine gas and 70% Hydrofluoric Acid.  The largest container of chlorine gas that might be stored at the facility is a one-ton cylinder.  The largest container of hydrofluoric acid that might be stored at GW- Pasco is a 55-gallon drum.  \n\nIII.  Worst Case Release Scenarios/Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThis section summaizes the worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios presented in the facility's RMP plan.  As defined by the CAA, the worst-case scenario describes the consequences of a release of the entire contents of the largest single container with the largest distance to a toxic endpoint within 10-minutes.  The alternative release scenario describes the consequences of a release of 300 pounds of chlorine from the conta"

An alternative release scenario for the release of a single 55-gallon drum of 70% Hydrofluoric Acid is also described.\n\nA.  Worst Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worse-case scenario for GW - Pasco is a release of a one-ton container of chlorine gas.  A release of this magnitude would impact receptors within a three-mile radius (as determined by RMP*Comp).  The Company believes that this release scenario is extremely unlikely given the inherent integrity of containers used for chlorine.  Chlorine ton containers are manufactured to meet stringent U.S. Department of Transportation standards.  These container standards are specifically designed to minimize (if not eliminate) the possibility of accidental release during the rigors of transportation in commerce.  Manufacturing specifications include the use of >1-inch thick steel for the body of the cylinder.  Cylinder weight exceeds 1,500 pounds when empty.  These containers can only be moved at the facility in single units (i.e., one at a time).  This factor, by itself, eliminates the possibility of a release (during onsite movement) of a quantity greater than one cylinder.  Cylinder valves are protected within a recessed compartment to prevent accidental damage during handling/transportation.  \n\nGW - Pasco stores chlorine containers outdoors under a canopy to provide protection from weather/temperature.  The storage area is not located in an area subject to traffic. \n\nB.  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios at GW- Pasco include (1) the accidental release of 300 pounds of chorine from a one-ton container and (2) the accidental release of the entire contents of a drum of hydrofluoric acid.  \n\nRelease of Chlorine: Because of the inherent integrity of the cylinder itself, only the valve and fusible plug present feasible release scenarios.  As explained above, the valve is recessed inside the cylinder and damage could only occur if an object"

      "SummaryText": " enters the recessed area with sufficient force to damage the valve.  The fusible plug is designed to melt at 157'F.  If the fusible plug melts as a result of fire, it is expected that the chlorine would be entirely consumed by the fire.  The facility has the appropriate chlorine kits for containing releases from chlorine containers.  These kits are designed to seal leaks at the valve or fusible plug.  The radius of the area affected by the alternative release scenario is approximately 0.1 miles.  Therefore, only the street immediately in front of the facility and the neighboring facility across the street could be affected by a release under the alternative scenario.\n\nRelease of Hydrofluoric Acid: Hydrofluoric acid is stored in plastic UN-approved, 55-gallon drums.  The most likely release scenario would occur if a drum was punctured during onsite movement by the forks of a forklift.  In this case, it is expected that the contents would release at approximately 25 pounds per minute.  Active mitigation measures could lessen the amount released (e.g., patching the drum by trained employees wearing the appropriate personal protection equipment).  This release would be in an enclosed building and have the same affected area as the previous alternative scenario. Forklifts are inspected daily to minimize the risk of malfunction.  Annual preventive maintenance is also performed to minimize the risks associated with equipment failure.\n\nC.  Accidental Release Prevention Planning at the Facility\n\n1.  Rules and Regulations that Apply to this Facility\n\nToo many federal, state and local environmental and safety rules and regulations apply to this facility to detail in this summary.  The primary legislation affecting chlorine is OSHA's Process Safety Management rule.  There are no rules that apply specifically to hydroflouric acid, although it is covered generally under OSHA and EPA regulations.  A chlorine PSM program has been implemented at the facility.

      "SummaryText": " building codes also apply to this facility and are enforced by the Pasco Building Department.  The building department performs regular (e.g., annual) safety inspections of the facility (with oversight by the fire department).\n\nThe Company has a formal safety training program designed to meet training requirements promulgated by OSHA, DOT and EPA.  Hazard communication training (OSHA) is the primary method the Company uses to educate employees on the risks associated with these two chemicals.  Emergency response training is performed in accordance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulations (29 CFR Part 1910.120).\n\n2.  Internal (Company) Release Prevention Program Requirements\n\nGW is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  It is actively engaged in the process of becoming certified under the NACD's \"Product Stewardship/Responsible Distribution\" Program.  This program requires member companies to prepare policies and procedures that promote the safe use and handling of chemical products by member companies and also by customers who purchase the chemical products.  GW has more than 100 policies/procedures that address topics including the storage, handling, and transportation of compressed gases and incident planning for chlorine and hydrofluoric acid (among other GW-designated \"chemicals of concern\"). \n\nGW facilities are audited at least annually for compliance with all internal and external requirements by GW environmental staff.  \n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have never been any accidents or accidental releases involving either of these chemicals at GW - Pasco.\n\nE.  Emergency Response Program\n\nGW - Pasco has an emergency response plan that is reviewed and updated as often as necessary (e.g., to reflect changes in personnel, emergency response contractors, etc.).  The facility has contracted with two emergency response contractors to provide assistance with any incidents that cannot be handled by the facility or the fire department.  G"

This number is staffed 24-hours per day; the on-call technical support employee will be paged immediately to provide assistance during an incident.  The on-call staff acts as backup to the on-site emergency coordinators.\n\nE.  Planned Improvements to Safety Program\n\nGWCC is committed to accident prevention and, accordingly, maintains an excellent reputation in the chemical distribution industry.  The primary planned improvement to GW's safety program is an update of the training materials (e.g., videos and handouts) to meet revised regulatory requirements.\n"
