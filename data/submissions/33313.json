The County's proactive approach to implementing new policies for emergency management and accidental release prevention has been a keystone to their success over the years.  The gaseous chlorine system (Process) at the Martin Downs WTP & WWTP has not had an accidental release since the plant was acquired by the County in 1993.  The current prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Martin Downs WTP & WWTP is located in Palm City, FL and utilizes chlorine gas process via vacuum injection for the disinfection of water and wastewater.
