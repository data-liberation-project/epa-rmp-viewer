It was constructed for Target Corporation; Target\n\nassumed responsibility for the building in December 2008. Prior to that date, Ryan Companies managed the\n\nconstruction, startup, daily maintenance, and operation of the facility.\n\n\n\nSince initial construction, two significant contruction projects have occurred. New banana ripening rooms were installed. Additionally, evaporators were added to an area for the storage of wet produce.\n\n\n\nTarget manages the Process Safety Management Plan in accordance to all federal, local, and state\n\nregulations.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTarget recognizes that accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system and other equipment is an ever\n\npresent risk to the health of team members and the community. Target is committed to safety at every level.\n\nTarget's prevention solutions include both technology as well as an active business unit that is qualified to\n\nmonitor and manage the refrigeration and PSM program.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP) are living documents,\n\ndefining the administrative and operational processes relevant to the ammonia refrigeration system. Target\n\nreserves the right to modify and adapt its PSM and RMP plans as appropriate to address changes in our\n\nbusiness processes, as well as things deemed ineffective. The overall intent of these programs is to minimize\n\nor eliminate the following potential threats for achieving a safe work place and zero refrigerant releases:\n\n- Human error in operating or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\n- Human error when working around or near ammonia refrigeration system "

      "SummaryText": " Pre-Startup Review PSM Guideline stipulates that Pre-start up safety reviews are conducted any time the\n\nammonia refrigeration system or any of its components are opened to atmosphere for repairs, tie-ins, or\n\nmodifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction is complete, documentations still\n\naccurate, operating procedures in place, training is complete and safety pre-cautions are suitable for safe\n\nstartup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nA Compliance Audit PSM Guideline specifying the process and frequency for evaluation of PSM and RMP\n\nprogram effectiveness. These audits are to be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective\n\nactions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nThe most recent compliance audit was carried out in September 2012.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nThe Incident Investigation PSM Guideline descripes processes to promptly investigate any incident that has\n\nresulted in, or could reasonably result in, an unintentional release of ammonia. These investigations are to\n\nidentify situations leading to incidents, as well as corrective actions implemented to prevent reoccurring and future releases, with reports retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nAn Employee (team member) Participation PSM Guideline describes team member utilization in the\n\ndevelopment and implementation of the facility's PSM and RMP programs. In addition, the guideline\n\nidentifies new team member orientation; training and communication processes to be followed for educating\n\nteam members about the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia and safety programs in place to\n\nmitigate risks of injury and accidental release. This includes processes for making all PSM and RMP\n\ninformation related to implementation, including Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) information available to\n\nteam members.\n\n\n\nTeam members are encouraged to report unsafe conditio"

It mandates a pre-qualification process\n\nwhich includes evaluation of contractor safety records, documented understanding of the facility's work\n\nrules, and commitment to ongoing training of their employees, as related to the hazards associated with\n\nammonia refrigeration systems. Target is committed to continually informing contractors regarding known\n\npotential hazards related to work with ammonia systems and the facilities procedures for emergency\n\nresponse should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases, accidents, or near misses that could've resulted in a catastrophic failure or\n\nsignificant release.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan PSM Guideline identifies specific procedures implemented in the event of various\n\nemergencies, including an ammonia release. The Emergency Action Plan addresses adequate first aid and\n\nmedical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as\n\npost-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nManufacturer and designed safety specification and precautions have been included in the design,\n\nconstruction, and operation of this facility. Identified opportunities are addressed and mitigated. It is\n\nintended that the PSM and RMP programs implemented for the facility drive a proactive approach that\n\nimproves safety and prevention, utilizing constant review processes of operations and activities, to assure a\n\nsafe environment for team members and the community of Cedar Falls."
