The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The Dandy Plant and PSM Program are specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Dandy to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals have been achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations. \r\n\r\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared for accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. The ammonia process is equipped with a state-of-the-art monitoring, control and alarm system.  The system was permitted by the Oxnard Fire/CUPA agency according to locally adopted code requirements (CFC Article"

If and when an ammonia leak is detected, notifications and alarms are provided to management, employees and refrigeration technicians according to alarm intensity.  Automatic shutdown and ventilation systems are activated according to pre-set parameters.  In the event of a major release involving the Refrigeration Room, the supervising alarm company provides direct and immediate notification to Oxnard Fire/CUPA in addition to the other alarms and management notifications.  A secondary alarm system provides low-level alarm text messaging to refrigeration technicians when sensors detect ammonia at 20PPM, enabling early problem detection.  Our policy is to regularly test and maintain the monitoring, control and alarm systems per our Mechanical Integrity Program, which is intended to ensure proper actuation and function of the refrigeration-related systems and components on a continuous basis. \r\n\r\nThe Company has adopted a Non-responding Facility Emergency Response Policy.  The Plant's California Hazardous Material Business Plan was developed to be consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements (i.e. notify and evacuate).  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (Oxnard Fire/CUPA); the CUPA inspects the plant and receives copies of the Business Plan updated at regular intervals.  The CUPA has been involved in the development of the plant from the initial permitting stage, and a CUPA Representative has participated in past Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  It is our policy to maintain compliance and a good working relationship with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA.\r\n\r\nThe facility is supported by its partner company, Western Precooling Systems (WPS), for maintenance and emergencies.

Refrigeration equipment consists of Compressors, Pressure Vessels, Evaporative Condenser, Evaporators (Room Units), Water Chillers, HydroVac&trade; Vacuum Tubes, ammonia pumps and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.

Schedules and written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release, have been developed.  Written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, inspection, maintenance, and moving of portable equipment (Hydro-Vac&trade; Vacuum Tubes).  As inspection and maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific task for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the service call system. Tasks are then tracked to completion through the service call system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Dandy and WPS reduce equipment operational problems and potential for releases.

Refrigeration process engineering was provided by Snowden Engineering of Salinas, CA; the refrigeration system installing contractor was Kemper Refrigeration.  Ongoing maintenance is now managed via Dandy's relationship with WPS.  The only significant change in the refrigeration system in the last 5 years was the replacement and upgrade of the ammonia diffusion tank system.\r\n\r\nTwo separate companies employing entirely separate workforces operate at the Plant: Dandy Cooling Company (Dandy) and Duda Farm Fresh Foods (Duda).
