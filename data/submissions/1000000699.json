              "Description": "Purpose - to develop a hazardous material process safety management program that will protect the employees and neighbors from catastophic releases, minimize lesser incidents and comply with regulations.  This will be accomplished by training all personnel in safe handling techniques and rapid emergency response.  Employees will be named to teams to implement and maintain the program.  The teams will include members of the operations and maintenance departments including supervisors and managers.  The goal is to have those involved with the chlorine process placed on teams.\n\n\n\nThe completed plan will be available for all employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nTEAMS\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nDJ Fox, Op Supervisor             Brian Bridwell, Lead Operator             \n\nGary Turley,  Project Manager     Rock Marker,  Lab Tech II (Deployed)\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBrian Bridwell, Lead Operator\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nGary Turley, Project Manager      Jose Foster, Operator\n\nDJ Fox, Op Supervisor             Rock Marker, Lab Tech II (Deployed) \n\n                           \n\nCHLORINE DISINFECTION PROCESS SAFETY ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nHAZARDS\n\n\n\nTOXICITY\n\nChlorine, in and of itself, is not toxic.  It is, however, classified as a poisonous gas because when it combines with moisture it produces corrosive acids.  If inhaled the gas combines with moisture in the body to form acids that irritate and burn bodily tissues.  Chlorine inhalation can cause lung damage and death from pulmonary edema.\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure limits: TWA = 0.5 parts per million.  STEL = 1.0 ppm\n\n\n\nEye effects: 1 ppm can cause redness, tearing and irritation.  Exposure to greater concentrations of vapor or to liquid can cause burns and blindness.\n\nSkin effects: Exposure to liquid will cause burns.  Exposure to gas can cause burns.\n\n\n\nOther toxic effects: Inhalation is the major route of exposure. Exposure to 3-6 ppm can cause irritation of the upper respiratory tract, headaches, and coughing.  10 ppm will cause severe irritation of respiratory tract.  15-20 ppm can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  Pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonia can follow.  Exposures to greater concentrations can cause unconsciousness and death.\n\n\n\nExposure to 0.5 ppm for 8 hours or 1.0 ppm for 4 hours can cause transient reduction in pulmonary capacity.\n\n\n\nChlorine is not listed as a carcinogen by NIP, IARC or OSHA.\n\n\n\n\n\nChronic effects: Chronic exposure is unlikely because of the disagreeable odor of concentrations of even 1 ppm.  Tests indicate that intermittent exposures to concentrations of that level caused no observable adverse health effects.\n\n\n\nOral ingestion is unlikely because chlorine exists as a gas at ambient temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND DESCRIPTION\n\nChlorine is an element of the halogen family.\n\n\n\nMolecular Weight: 70.9  Specific gravity (liquid): 1.467\n\nBoiling point: -34o C  Melting point:  -101o C\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored under pressure as liquid in one ton containers.  Liquid chlorine is brownish and about 1.5 times as heavy as water.  Chlorine is removed from the containers as a gas.  Chlorine exists as greenish/yellowish gas at normal temperatures and has a sharp disagreeable odor.  Chlorine gas occupies 450 times the volume of its liquid state.   Chlorine gas is approximately 2.5 times as heavy as air.\n\n\n\nREACTIVITY AND CORROSITIVITY DATA\n\n\n\nChlorine is stable.\n\n\n\nChlorine is neither explosive or flammable, but will support combustion.  Dry chlorine is not corrosive but it easily combines with water to form corrosive hypochlorous and hydrochloric acids.\n\n\n\nINCOMPATIBILITY DATA\n\nMay cause fire and/or explosion upon contact with turpentine, ether, ammonia, hydrocarbons, certain metal hydrides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphates, or easily oxidized materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESS TECHNOLOGY\n\n\n\nChlorine is used at the Pampa Wastewater Treatment Plant, in the manner mandated by state and federal laws, to disinfect treated municipal wastewater by inactivating potential pathogens.  Although the exact process is not completely understood, chlorine is thought to penetrate the cell wall causing destruction of the organism.\n\n\n\nINVENTORY\n\nMaximum:  3 (1 ton cylinders)  Minimum: 1  Operating: 1\n\n\n\nSTORAGE\n\nTon cylinders are placed between roller chocks that are bolted to a raised concrete slab that is mounted to the floor of the storage area.  Chlorine must be stored under pressure to maintain its liquid state (See boiling point above).  The pressure varies with ambient temperature.  At 50o F for example, the pressure inside the cylinders is 60 psi.  Pressures increase as temperatures increase.  The cylinders are equipped with a fusible plug that acts as a pressure release if ambient temperature reaches 158o F. To avoid excessive temperatures the storage room is open on two sides. \n\n\n\nSince chlorine gas is removed from the cylinders by vacuum there are no pressure lines in the storage room.\n\n\n\nSAFETY LIMITS\n\nTemperature: Upper..120o F.  Lower..N/A\n\n(In reality temperatures in the storage area are those of the outside because the room is not enclosed on two sides.)\n\n\n\nPressure: Upper  250 psi   Lower..N/A\n\n(Pressure would be approaching 318 psi before the fusible plug(s) give.)\n\n\n\nExceeding 158o F. or 318 psi would cause a release of chlorine gas that would threaten the safety of employees and physical integrity of any metals contacted in the presence of water.     \n\n\n\nELECTRICAL CLASSIFICATION\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\nEQUIPMENT UNITS\n\n3 chlorine ton cylinders** \n\n3 craddles capable of holding one cylinder each* \n\n1 remote readout, for scale\n\n1 manifolds with hookups for one cylinders\n\n1 regulator* \n\n1 chlorinator* \n\na eductor (injectors)* \n\n1 cable hoist for moving chlorine cylinders\n\n1 self contained breathing units** \n\n2 half mask respirators\n\n*See Appendix II for detailed information on these equipment units\n\n **See Appendix III for detailed information on these equipment units\n\nPHYSICAL PROCESS\n\nChlorine is purchased in ton cylinders.  Cylinders are removed from the delivery truck and placed in roller chocks in the chlorine storage area.  Empty cylinders are loaded on the delivery truck and returned to the supplier.   \n\n\n\nRemoval of gas from the cylinders is accomplished by means of a vacuum generated by a venturi tube (eductor).  Service water is pumped across a venturi tube increasing the velocity causing a drop in pressure.  There is an aperture in the venturi tube connected to a line to a v-notch chlorinator which in turn is connected to a regulator affixed to the uppermost valve on the chlorine cylinder.  The vacuum withdraws chlorine gas from the cylinder.\n\n\n\nThe rate of removal is controlled in one of two ways.  Manually, dosage is changed by adjusting a rotometer.  Automatically, the dosage can be linked to a percentage of the effluent flow.  The chlorinators and eductors are plumbed in parallel and valved so that application can be made at the secondary clarifiers (along the perimeter of the launders).\n\n\n\nThe chlorination at the secondary clarifiers is for proper kill of pathogenic organisms through the chlorine contact basins with a limit set forth from the permit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for the Pampa WWTP.  Chlorine residual of the final effluent has permitted requirements of 0.02 mg/L.\n\n\n\nChlorination along the perimeter of the secondary clarifiers aids in the removal of algae accumulation in the launders.  If not removed regularly algae causes a false chlorine demand in the chlorine contact basin, which may lead to inadequate disinfection.\n\nThe feed to the influent channels for pre-chlorination is not normally used.  The feed rate depends on quantity and quality of water being treated.  Sunlight, rising temperatures, increase of organic loading, turbidity, algae, and filamentous bacteria blooms can all require additional chlorine.  Chlorine residual is recorded daily at the outfall of the final effluent. \n\n\n\nFor the Pampa Wastewater Treatment Plant the daily effluent residual can not exceed 0.099 mg/l, nor can the monthly average exceed 0.099 mg/l without a violation being reported to the EPA and TCEQ.  The wastewater treatment plant must maintain a chlorine residual of 1.0 mg/L or greater for at least 20 minutes at all times.\n\n\n\nThe in-service chlorine cylinder is placed on a scale for monitoring of pounds used.  Dial read outs, located in the chlorine room, provide constant monitoring of the total weight on the scales.  Each day during morning rounds the weight is noted and the pounds used during the previous day calculated.  Chlorine consumption is entered in the process control spreadsheet as pounds used per 24 hours. \n\n\n\nThe regulator affixed to the cylinders are valve and heating devices that open when vacuum is applied and close automatically when the cylinder is empty.  Since the chlorine is stored as liquid under pressure in a partially filled cylinder (80% full at 68o F.= 1 ton.) chlorine gas is drawn off the top of the cylinder.  If, when the cylinder is placed on line a tiny amount of liquid chlorine enters the regulator assembly the heater converts it to gas.  \n\n\n\nThe regulator is attached to the in-service cylinder. The empty cylinder is then removed from the scale and is replaced by a full cylinder. (See the procedure for changing cylinders.)\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL PROCESS\n\nWhen chlorine is added to water the chemical reaction is:\n\n      Cl2    +   H2O  -->       HOCl     +    HCl\n\n    chlorine            water               hypochlorous acid          hydrochloric acid                         \n\nHypochlorous acid is the primary disinfectant and is thought to inactivate bacteria, viruses, and most protozoa by penetrating the cell wall.  Certain protozoa that form cysts in adverse environments can, however, be quite resistant to chlorination.\n\n\n\nSome of the hypochlorous acid dissociates as follows:\n\n\n\n     HOCl      -->        H+        +           OCl-     \n\nhypochlorous acid                      hydrogen ion                    hypochlorite ion\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrochloric acid also dissociates in water:\n\n        HCl     -->       H+         +           Cl-\n\n hydrochloric acid                      hydrogen                       chlorine  ion   \n\n\n\nChlorine is an oxidizing agent and will combine with impurities, if present, in the water to form chlorine compounds such as chloramine.  Feeding of additional chlorine destroys some of these compounds (A procedure known as breakpoint chlorination).  \n\n\n\n\n\nVENTILATION\n\nThe chlorine building is open on the east and west ends and provides for open cirulation \n\n\n\n\n\nSAFETY EQUIPMENT\n\nA bottle of ammonia is provided near cylinders to manually check for leaks whenever a new cylinder is placed in service.  (Ammonia fumes and chlorine gas combine to form a white vapor.)\n\n\n\nPersonal protective equipment is located in the office building. Equipment includes boots, gloves, chemical googles, rain gear,and a self-contained breathing unit and half-mask regulator. The units are in a black plastic transportable case and are also used for off-property confined space inspections and emergencies. \n\n\n\nA chlorine \"B\" repair kit is located at the Central Fire Station  \n\n\n\nPlease see the emergency response plan for further safety information.\n\n\n\n\n\nINSTRUMENTS\n\nChlorine residuals are checked daily by grab samples using the Hach DR 2700 meter.  A chlorine reagent is added to a 10 ml sample cell which is placed in the spectrophotometer for analysis.\n\n\n\nMATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION\n\nSee mechanical drawings for piping schematic.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHLORINATION PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA \"What-If\" method is used to identifying hazards.  We have assumed only one operator on duty unless a malfunction occurs during work, such as changing cylinders, that requires a two man team.\n\n\n\nThe only place that chlorine is under pressure is in the cylinders themselves.  Therefore, the principal hazards involved are the integrity of the cylinders and cylinder valves.\n\n\n\nPLANT SITING\n\nThe plant is located on the north bank of Red Deer Creek, at a point 3400 feet northeast of State Highway Loop 171, approximately 3.5 miles northeast of the intersection of U.S. Highway 60 and State Highway 273 in Gray County, Texas\n\n\n\nGround is rolling, stable, and above the flood plain.\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNAL FACTORS\n\n\n\nCHLORINATORS, EDUCTORS, PIPING\n\nWhat-if a leak developed on the piping?\n\nBecause chlorine gas is removed from the cylinders by vacuum a failure of the vacuum lines would: (A) Cause the regulators on the cylinders to fail closed; and (B) Cause outside air to be sucked into the lines.  No hazard exists.\n\n\n\nWhat-if a chlorinator fails?  \n\nA vacuum failure causes the regulator to fail closed.  No hazard results.\n\n\n\nWhat-if an eductor (injector) fails?  \n\nA vacuum failure causes the regulator to fail closed.  No hazard results.\n\n\n\nREGULATORS\n\nWhat-if a regulator fails?  \n\nRegulator is designed to fail closed.  No hazard results.\n\n\n\nWhat-if the regulator heater fails?  \n\nRegulator still functions.\n\n\n\nCYLINDER VALVES\n\nWhat-if a cylinder valve will not open?\n\nValve wrench can be struck sharply with the palm of the hand.  If valve will still not open the supplier is called and the cylinder is exchanged.  No hazard results.\n\n\n\nWhat-if a cylinder valve will not close properly?\n\nIf the leak is minor the valve cap can be put on and the valve can be opened and closed.  The handle can be struck sharply with the palm of the hand to seat it.  Check valve to see if leak still exists.  If the leak is bad enough for self-contained breathing units to be donned the fire department and or Chemtrec will be called.  Operators can don breathing units and enter the storage room with fireman and repeat procedure outlined above.\n\nWhat-if a cylinder valve breaks off while operator is opening or closing it?\n\nOperators while already wearing SCBA leave room, call fire department and Chemtrec.  After fire department arrives, leak can be stopped by at least two people wearing the proper personal protection equipment and hammering a drift pin from the repair \"B\" kit in the opening left by the broken valve. \n\n\n\nCYLINDERS\n\nWhat-if liquid chlorine appears in the hypalon tubing when cylinder is placed in service?\n\nClose valve, use hair dryer to gently warm tube until chlorine dissipates.  Remove regulator, rotate cylinder 180o, reattach regulator and place in service.  \n\n\n\nWhat-if liquid chlorine still appears in the hypalon tubing?\n\nTake cylinder off line and inform supplier of defective cylinder (probably over-filled) and request a replacement cylinder.\n\n\n\nWhat-if a cylinder develops a leak in a side wall?\n\nFire Department and Chemtrec must be called.  After the fire department arrives the leak can be repaired by two people using the repair \"B\" kit, while wearing the proper personal protection equipment.\n\n\n\nWhat-if a catastrophic failure of a cylinder occurs?\n\nFire department and Chemtrec must be called.  Operator will notify project manager or next in command.  Pampa police will evacuate nearby area as necessary.  \n\n\n\nEXTERNAL FACTORS\n\n\n\nVANDALISM\n\nWhat-if attempt to vandalize occurs?\n\nStorage area is not lockable.  Operators are on duty only 9 hrs. per day Monday-Friday and 4 hrs. per day on weekends.  It would be possible to break into the plant and storage area.\n\n\n\nFLOOD\n\nThis event is not likely in view of plant location.\n\n\n\nTornadoes\n\n\n\nAt present there are no means of strapping the cylinders to their cradles.  The cylinders are held in place by their own weight.\n\n\n\nEmergency access to storage area is good via driveway around the plant.\n\n*See Appendix IV for detailed map of area and prevailing wind directions\n\nCHLORINE INCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no catastrophic or personal injury related occurrences due to chlorine release at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAINING POLICY FOR OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS\n\nAND EMPLOYEES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS\n\n\n\nSTATEMENT OF POLICY\n\nAll outside contractors and employees from other departments will be informed of the chlorine storage and given appropriate training.\n\n\n\nTRAINING REQUIRED\n\nOutside personnel will be informed of appropriate escape routes.

      "SummaryText": "CITY of PAMPA WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nGeneral Facility Information\n\nThe Pampa Wastewater Treatment Plant located off of Highway Loop 171, east of the City in Gray County.  The facility is owned by the City of Pampa and operated by Operations Management International, Inc (OMI).  Capacity of the facility is 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD).  Presently on average, the wastewater treatment plant processes 2.2 MGD of wastewater.  The plant utilizes an activated sludge oxidation ditch process that operates 24 hours per day year round.  The plant is staffed 9 hours per day Monday through Friday and on week ends 4 hours per day.  A maximum of 3 tons of chlorine gas in one ton containers are stored onsite with 1 container being connected and online at any one time.  \n\nOngoing safety training programs cover all phases of plant operation from maintenance and operations safety to safe handling of chlorine.  OMI also conducts formal training as well as onsite training during normal daily operations.  OMI also uses outside vendors to conduct safety training relating to plant safety and chemical safety.  Due to this safety training, this plant has not had any significant chlorine release or accidents in the last five years.\n\n\nHazard Assessment Information\n\n40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B - Hazard Assessment, outlines a specific set of criteria required to be used in the modeling of worst case and most probable case release scenarios.  Worst case and most probable case scenario modeling was completed using Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) software.\n\nTo complete most probable case and worse case scenario plume models, the default level of concern for chlorine was set at levels established in accordance with EPA and American Industrial Hygiene Association standards.  The resulting plume indicates a level where individuals would be able to take protective actions without suffering any serious health effects from a chemical exposure during a one hour or less time period"

      "SummaryText": ".  Most probable case and worse case scenario plume analysis results are conservative estimates based on the ALOHA software, using RMP release and meteorological requirements.\n\n\nPrevention Program Information\n\nThe Pampa Wastewater Treatment Plant processes 2.2 MGD of domestic sewage.  OMI has an on-going training plan that involves both classroom and on-the-job training.  All new employees are trained in chlorine safety and undergo Right-to-Know training.  \nAny small controlled leak will be handled by plant personnel and all other leaks will be handled by the Pampa Fire Department.\n\n\nEmergency Response Information \n\nA controlled release of the chlorine product located at the wastewater treatment plant, will be defined as the escape of gas to the atmosphere in small, non-reportable quantities, resulting from standard operating procedures of connecting or disconnecting chlorine containers and standard maintenance procedures on the plant's chlorine equipment.\n\nAn uncontrolled release of chlorine gas which will require the implementation of the emergency response procedures is defined as any release other than those examples defined as similar to controlled releases.  Emergency responses to the treatment plant will be made by the Pampa Fire Department, in accordance with the facility emergency plan and the Gray County Emergency Response Plan.  If uncontrolled release conditions warrant such actions, shelter-in-place, evacuation, and public warning will be implemented by the Pampa/Gray County Office of Emergency Management.  Any uncontrolled release of chlorine gas shall be subject to an after action incident investigation by the City of Pampa, OMI, and exclusive State and Federal regulatory agencies for review and oversight."
