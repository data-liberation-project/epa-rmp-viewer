      "SummaryText": "Background\r\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy is an ethanol production facility located at 4895 Pembroke Road on the southeast side of Hopkinsville, Kentucky.  The facility began production in the spring of 2004.  \r\n\r\nWhen the facility reaches full production capacity, it will process approximately 15 million bushels of corn grown within the Hopkinsville area. Annually the plant will produce 45 million gallons of fuel grade ethanol plus another 130,000 tons of distiller's dry grains (DDGS).\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy is subject to RMP regulations due to the storage of pentane in excess of 10,000 pounds.  This facility previously reported for ammonia in 2004, 2009, and 2014; ammonia was discontinued at this facility in 2018 and has been removed from the risk management plan.\r\n\r\nChemical Management Program\r\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Commonwealth Agri-Energy is located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  The facility is operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  The plant's safety program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.  Commonwealth Agri-Energy's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves a wide range of senior management personnel, including the Environmental and Safety Coordinators.  Additionally, regular safety meetings are conducted to discuss a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training issues.\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy currently has one (1) process that contains a regulated substance covered by EPA's 40 CFR Part 68 (pe"

The denaturant is added to the denatured alcohol tank (TF-8308, 700,000 gallon capacity) by pump before tanker truck transfer.  The denaturant tank (TS-8306) is a 39,000 gallon vertical AST with a flexible roof and berm for spill control.  It is stored at ambient temperature.  The transfer line to ethanol storage tank # is a 3 steel pipe approximately 300 feet long.\r\n\r\nThe tank and piping system are equipped with several safety devices to mitigate an accidental release.  The primary safety devices are excess flow valves that are designed to automatically close and prevent excessive release of natural gasoline from the storage tank.\r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequence Release Scenarios\r\nThis information is being withheld due to security concerns.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The elements of the PSM program include:\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Agri-Energy' PSM program includes the following elements:\r\n&#61607;\tProcess Safety Information,\r\n&#61607;\tProcess Hazard Analysis,\r\n&#61607;\tOperating Procedures,\r\n&#61607;\tTraining,\r\n&#61607;\tMechanical Integrity,\r\n&#61607;\tIncident Investigations,\r\n&#61607;\tCompliance Audits,\r\n&#61607;\tManagement of Change,\r\n&#61607;\tPre-Startup Review,\r\n&#61607;\tContractors,\r\n&#61607;\tEmployee Participation, and\r\n&#61607;\tHot Work Permits.\r\n\r\nAs part of the release prevention program, the system is equipped with relief valves and safety systems designed and installed in accordance with industry standards.  These systems are designed to prevent a catastrophic release of pentane.  Commonwealth Agri-Energy also utilizes a preventative maintena"
