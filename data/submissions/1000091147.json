The facility is operated by Plumrose USA, Inc., which has headquarters at 651 W. Washington Blvd., Suite 302, Chicago, IL 60661.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Plumrose receives and processes raw meat (pork bellies). The pork bellies are processed by washing, injecting, and smoking on site. After processing, the pork bellies are then sliced, and packaged for retail sale. From the time the pork bellies are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process.
