This Risk Management Plan\nsummarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work\ntogether to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan\nsummary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements,\nincluding:\n\n-    Introduction;\n-    Elf Atochem policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n-    Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n-    Hazard Assessment;\n-    Prevention Program;\n-    Five year accident history;\n-    Emergency Response Plan;\n-    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at Elf Atochem for many years; this\nRMP formalizes and documents these activities.  Elf Atochem is committed to conducting its\noperations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  \n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior\nmanagement routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This\nemphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where plant personnel regularly review\nsafety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success\nof Elf Atochem's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by\nemployees and contractors.  \n\nElf Atochem's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials\ndesigned to fulfill Elf Atochem's commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These\nmaterials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and or\nreduce the risk of accidents.  \n\nThe Elf Atochem Carrollton facility is located at 2316 Highland Ave., Carrollton, Kentucky. \nThe facility is a specialty chemical manuf"

These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability. \nThese substances are present in the covered processes at the following levels:\n\nChlorine (Cl2)                     180,000 pounds\nPhosphorous Trichloride (PCL3)          292,000 pounds\n\nChlorine and phosphorous trichloride are used as process feedstocks.  \n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a liquid chlorine rail car. \nChlorine is received as a liquid in pressurized rail cars and fed directly into the process.  The\ncapacity of a rail car is 90 tons, and this quantity was assumed to be released over 10 minutes in\nthe worst case scenario.  \n\nHazard assessment modeling shows that, under worst case weather conditions, the worst case\nrelease could produce a chlorine plume that could travel more than 25 miles before dispersing\nenough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.  It should be noted\nthat regulatory agencies and Elf Atochem believe that the worst case scenario is an extremely\nunlikely event.  This Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention\nmeasures implemented by Elf Atochem to reduce the risk of this type of event.  \n\nThe multiple layers of preventative measures make it very unlikely that a significant chlorine\nrelease will occur.  Chlorine rail cars are built with extreme integrity and safety precautions.  The\nrail cars are rigorously designed and tested according to the procedures and schedules\nrecommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nIn addition, in the unlikely event that a release occurs, Elf Atochem has an array of mitigation\nmeasures to reduce any potential impacts.   These include:\n\n-    Site emergency action plan;\n-    Chlorine detectors;\n-    Alarm system initiated by chlorine detectors;\n-    Plant emergency alarm system;\n-    Op"

A description of each of these scenarios and the estimated distance of the potential\nimpacts is as follows.  The Alternative release scenario for chlorine is the failure of the valve\npacking on a railcar, and the chlorine plume was estimated to go 2.2 miles before dispersing\nenough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.  The Alternative\nrelease scenario for phosphorous trichloride was overfilling a vessel, and the phosphorous\ntrichloride plume was estimated to go 0.43 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a\nhazard to the public.  These Alternative Release Scenarios are somewhat more likely than the\nWorst-Case Scenario, but are still very unlikely events.  This Risk Management Plan includes\ninformation on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by Elf Atochem to reduce the\nrisk of these type of events.  \n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenarios are, by definition, more likely than the Worst-Case\nScenario, they are still very unlikely given the facility's prevention program.

Prevention\nsteps for this scenario include preventative maintenance and standard operating procedures for\nconnecting the rail cars to the process.  An excess flow valve is present on the liquid connection\nwithin all chlorine rail cars.  The valves are designed to limit the rate of release to no more than\n15,000 pounds per hour.
