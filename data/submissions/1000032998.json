Poet Biorefining-Big Stone's\n\n main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.\n\n Production at the facility was initiated in January 2002.  Poet\n\n Biorefining-Big Stone produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is\n\n mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce fermentable sugars. Yeast is\n\n added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\n\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains up to 20% alcohol and is distilled,\n\n then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous\n\n Ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two\n\n 1,000,000-gallon storage tanks. The denaturant is then blended inline, as it is being loaded, with the 200 proof anhydrous Ethanol making it unfit for human consumption and completing the process. The inline blending process is conducted with set parameters to meet State and Federal requirements for Standard 200 Proof Ethanol and E85 shipments. The NGC denaturant is stored in Tank No.\n\n 805, which has a capacity of 60,000 gallons (approximately 378,000\n\n pounds).  NGC is blended with the ethanol to a maximum concentration of 2.5%\n\n NGC for Standard Shipments and 25% for E85 Shipments. The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank\n\n trucks and rail cars.\n\n\n\nChemicals Regulated Under EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which\n\nexceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.\n\nThe CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage\n\n tank, the denatured ethanol storage tanks, and the associated\n\n blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is in-line blended to the ethanol to\n\n a concentration up to 2.5% for Standard Shipments and up to 25% for E85 Shipments.  The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of\n\n denaturant in a tan"
