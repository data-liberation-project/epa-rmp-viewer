Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Underwood Farm Supply are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Pottawattamie County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 126,950 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the of the total contents of the storage tanks released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 126,950 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85 percent capaity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point is 4.4 miles.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario, a 3 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 11,900 pounds. The distance to the endpoint is .5 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Adm"
