Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \nThe Tokio Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and check list PHA methodologies, which are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.\n\nAs a minimum the Tokio Terminal performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.\n\nPHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented.  The Tokio Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule.  All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all effected employees.  All recommendations must be resolved by management.\n\nOperating Procedures: The Tokio Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  The Tokio Terminal written operating procedures address various modes of process operations, including: (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.  \n\nContractors:  The Tokio Terminal has developed and implemented a program to ensure that contractors used to supplement its workforce to perform maintenance, renovation or specialty work on or near RMP / PSM covered processes are qualified"
