POLICIES\n\n     - Accidental Release Prevention\n\n      Any accidental release of Ethylene Oxide (ETO) would be detected by strategically \nlocated ETO monitors.\n      ETO drums are leak tested at the factory after filling, and are tested for leaks upon \nreceiving at our facility.\n      The ETO storage area is electronically 24 hour monitored for ETO detection.\n      The ETO storage tank valves are only in the open position during ETO injection into the process.  \nThey are in the closed position at other times. \n      Three seperate computer controlled  shut-off valves and three  manual shut-off valves are located \nbetween the ETO storage tanks and the process. \n      ETO storage area is a limited access area.  \n      Receiving dock facility is located at the storage room for minimum movement of ETO tanks.\n      SCBA on site for emergency shut down use.\n\n      -Emergency Response\n\n      An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared and submitted to the Loudoun County LEPC  \nand the Sterling Fire Department. \n      Semi-annual emergency response drills are conducted.\n\n2.      STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n      The primary activity is the commercial sterilization of medical products for use in\nsurgery in hospitals.   \n     \n      -Regulated Substance\n        * Ethylene Oxide\n\n3.       RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n      -Worst Case\n       * Toxic Gas\n            ETO tank valve rupture with release of 100% of capacity (400 lbs) in 10 minutes.\n\n      -Alternative Release\n           * Toxic Gas\n            ETO tank valve rupture with release of 100% of capacity (400 lbs) in 22 minutes.  \nETO Manufacturer calculations are 22 minutes for a release of full open valve.  Automatic Electric Eyes and a manual release Deluge system is in place to slow airborne releases to the atmosphere.\n\n4.
