One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS # 26471-62-5. The TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 pounds.  In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture and immediate spillage of the contents of a TDI railcar into a concrete containment area. The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in no public receptors within the endpoint radius of 46 yards from the railcar.\n\nThe Conover facility also manufactures extruded polyethylene foam products, using isobutane (CAS # 75-28-5).  The isobutane inventory is maintained above 10,000 pounds.  In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as a release of the entire contents of the bulk isobutane storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The impact of the vapor cloud explosion was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in public receptors within the endpoint radius of 452 yards from the storage tank.\n\nThis facility has an OSHA HAZWOPER trained Hazmat Team, which will provide initial response to spills of TDI.  This facility also has contracted professional emergency responders as back-up.  If required, the assistance of the Conover fire department will be requested.\n\nThe facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC, local fire department, and local police department.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases involving TDI (mixed isomers) or isobutane at thi"
