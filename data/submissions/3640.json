In addition, these products are found in floor polishes, adhesives, inks, coatings and binders for paper products, as well as caulking, cement and concrete.  The Croydon Plant produces environmentally friendly products which contain no organic solvents.\n\nCroydon Plant produces more than one quarter million pounds of product annually, and employees 151 personnel.  The plant works with the Bristol Complex contributing to a variety of charitable organizations within the community and provides support to the Habitat for Humanity.   The Bristol Complex works closely with its Community Advisory Council (CAC) to identify the needs and community concerns.\n\n3.0 The EPAs Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air containing a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical are subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate \"worst case\" and \"alternate case\" scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.  This document is part of Rohm and Haas Croydon Plants RMP communication effort.  \n\n4.0 Regulated Substances\n\nThe Croydon Plant uses three RMP toxic chemicals: \n   *Acrylonitrile monomer, Vinyl Acetate, Aqueous Ammonia (29.4%)\n                                                                                                                                                              \n5.0 Ac"

The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents:  .\n\n6.1)  Employee Participation  Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve plant safety.  Employees participate in safety committees, job safety analysis, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development and monthly safety meetings.\n \n6.2)Process Hazard Analysis - Various process hazard analysis techniques are used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with the chemicals and processes we use. Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analyses and updated a minimum of every five years.  Safety systems are designed into the processes.  These are designed to create several layers of protection, so that if one system fails other systems will maintain the process in a safe state.  Examples include:\n \n    * Redundant safety systems and instrumentation, particularly for tank level systems\n    * Automatic shutdown devices that are triggered if critical safety equipment malfunctions\n    * Secondary containment for storage tanks\n    * Alarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters\n    * Pressure relief devices to prevent over pressurization\n    * Fire protection systems\n    * Operator surveillance of unloading operations\n    * Permit system to control work in hazardous areas\n    * Work preplanning and safety reviews\n\n6.3) Operating Procedures  Operating procedures have been developed for all processes to insure safe operation.

The Rohm and Haas Croydon Plant has had no events meeting this criteria during the last five years.\n\n8.0 Emergency Response Program \n\nThe Rohm and Haas Croydon Plant plan is incorporated into a unified emergency response plan for the Bristol Complex.  This Consolidated Emergency Response Plan is  coordinated with the Bucks and Burlington County Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC), Bristol Township, and Croydon Fire Company.  New employees are trained on handling emergencies prior to working in a process area and plant personnel review the plan annually.  The plant has an extensive alarm system, which includes key alarms which sound at the Bristol Complex plant gate house.  The plant has an on-site fire brigade, mobile fire suppression vehicles, Hazmat Technicians as well as certified emergency medical personnel. The site has mobile foam capabilities to control vapor release.  All emergency response personnel receive ongoing monthly training.  The complex has 24-hour emergency response capabilities and can respond to both on-site and transportation off-site hazardous materials releases.  The complex is also part of the Rohm and Haas regional response network and provides offsite response into the community when requested on a mutual aid basis.  Complex emergency response personnel have radio communications with the Bucks County 911 center.  Emergency response personnel can be self dispatched, or dispatched through the County 911 center.  The Complex is also able to access the Community Alerting Network (CAN) through the Bristol Township Emergency Management Department.   Plant drill an"

      "SummaryText": "d mutual aid response activities are practiced annually.\n\n9.0 Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP rule provides detailed requirements that define a worst case scenario (WCS), namely a release of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel  occurring  under very stable weather conditions (Stability F), at a low wind speed (1.5 m/sec) and the hottest day over the past three years (1020 F).  EPA notes that the worse-case scenario is designed principally to support a dialogue between the source and the community on release prevention, and not to serve as the sole or primary basis for emergency planning. Based on previous history, in addition to the several layers of protection in place, these worse-case scenarios are highly unlikely to actually occur.\n\nThe RMP rule also defines the alternate release scenario (ARS).  Unlike worse-case scenarios, the ARS can be limited by active mitigation safeguards, such as alarms, automatic shutdowns, and operator interventions.   According to EPA, an ARS is a more useful communication tool for the public and first responders and for emergency response preparedness and planning.   More realistic weather conditions (Stability D), wind speed (4.3 m/sec) and temperature (54.60 F) are used for this evaluation.\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:  \nRohm and Haas Croydon Plant has identified one WCS for a toxic material based on the RMP definition.\n\nWorst Case Toxic\nThis scenario involves acrylonitrile, which is considered a toxic material under the RMP rule.   It assumes the loss of the entire inventory of a 130,000 railcar to an asphalt and earthenarea of 8900 sq. ft. over a ten minute period.  Loss to a larger area is prevented by the natural contour of the land, berming and dike wallsThe results show that if such a release occurred it would have an off site effect. Because of the plant controls, procedures and training, the worse case event is extremely unlikely. In addition, the construction of the railcars used to trans"

      "SummaryText": "port acrylonitrile would make this scenario unlikely.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nThe Croydon Plant has identified three ARS: one for each toxic material (3).  These scenarios were chosen after reviewing process hazard analysis, the plant spill history, and discussing alternatives with knowledgeable and experienced unit personnel.  The scenarios we have identified are more credible than those described in the worst case, but are still very unlikely given of the multiple levels of protection and extensive employee training. \n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS) - Acrylonitrile (Toxic Liquid)\nThe RMP rule requires an alternate release scenario (ARS) be picked for each covered toxic material. The following is the alternate scenario description for failure of a acrylonitrile pump seal:\n\nThis scenario assumes the failure of a mechanical pump seal during operation.  It is assumed that leakage would be through the equivalent of a one (1) inch hole allowing 550 pounds of material to flow into a concrete diked area of 77 sq. ft. Given the wind speed and weather conditions outlined previously, we would expect a plume of  711 feet from the point of origin.  The release could affect one (1) residence and two (2) businesses, depending on the direction of the wind.  The release could affect plant employees but given the prevailing wind direction towards undeveloped company owned land, this is not likely.  .  There are no environmental receptors affected.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario  Vinyl Acetate)  (Toxic Liquid)\nThe following is the alternate release scenario description assuming that an unloading hose for vinyl acetate leaks:\n\nIf the transfer line from a vinyl acetate railcar to the storage tank leaks, it is estimated  up to 550 pounds of vinyl acetate would be released to a concrete dike of 73 sq. ft.  The release would likely be stopped within 10 minutes because railcar unloading operations are monitored to minimize the risk of accidental release. Given the wind speed and weat"

No residences or environmental receptors would be affected.  .  \n\nAlternate Release Scenario  Ammonia (concentration of 29.4%)  (Toxic Liquid)\nThe following is the alternate release scenario description for overfilling an  aqueous ammonia storage tank.\n\nThis scenario assumes  a 1000 pound spill occurring from overfilling an aqueous ammonia storage tank during loading operations.  The scenario assumes that the release would last 18.4 minutes and would be captured in a concrete dike with a 397 sq ft. area.  Given the weather and temperature conditions previously referenced, we would expect a release distance of up to 129 feet.  There are no residences or environmental receptors within this toxic endpoint circle.  This spill is unlikely to occur given Department of Transportation regulations requiring offloading personnel to be within 25 feet of the tank wagon at all times to prevent overfilling.  \n\n\n10.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe  focus on safety is strong throughout the Rohm and Haas Company.  Rohm and Haas continuously looks for ways to reduce risks and to improve safety performance.  The Croydon Plant safety program is integrated into all parts of plant operation and involves the identification and implementation of  ways to improve safety performance.  For example, the plant has switched from TKOs to Differential Pressure Transmitters to minimize the risk of overfilling storage tanks.  The plant has also developed procedures to off load acrylonitrile railcars immediately upon arrival and to minimize other vehicular traffic in the rail yard during off loading operations. The Croydon Plant will continue to identify and implement other safety improvement opportunities as they are identified."
