      "SummaryText": "Hunter Panels located at 19727 57th Avenue East in Puyallup, Washington manufacturers rigid polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels for use in commercial and industrial roofing applications.  The company employs approximately 75 people at the facility in a non-union environment.  Hunter Panels occupies an approximate 400,000 square foot facility in Pierce County, Washington.  The facility is shared with Hunter Panels sister companies Insulfoam and Premier SIPS.  All three companies are part of Carlisle Construction Materials division.  Facility boundaries include Canyon Road to the west, Knoble Rd. E to the south, a railroad spur and residential area to the east, and another industrial facility to the north.\n\n\n\nThe polyisocyanurate foam insulating panels are produced by reacting a polyol (POLY) in a blend including a flame retardant and catalyst with polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (ISO).  Pentane material is used as an expanding or blowing agent in the production of the panels.  Different varieties of pentane material can be used including various blends of n-pentane, isopentane, and cyclopentane.  Isopentane and n-pentane are regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule with a 10,000 pound threshold.  Cyclopentane is not regulated under the RMP Rule.  Hunter Panels is also subject to the DOSH Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard in 296-67 WAC for all three isomers of pentane and maintains one plan to meet both the RMP and PSM requirements.\n\n\n\nThe facility receives a liquid pentane blend via tank truck and stores it in a 25,000-gallon aboveground pressure vessel for use in the production process.  This volume equates to a pentane material storage capacity of 130,250 to 155,332 pounds depending upon which pentane blend is used.  Throughout the RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) documentation at the facility the combination of various isomers of pentane is simply referred to as pentane.  No distinction is made to exclude a possible cyclopent"

      "SummaryText": "ane portion of the blend from the RMP component of the regulations.  For purposes of the Risk Management Plan submittal a maximum of 131,500 pounds of n-pentane and 130,250 pounds of isopentane are addressed.  Cyclopentane which is not regulated under the RMP regulation would have a maximum quantity of 155,332 pounds.  There is only one 25,000 gallon storage vessel on site.  It holds between 130,250 and 155,332 pounds of pentane depending on which isomer is being used as indicated above.  As an example, if the current blend is essentially n-pentane and 131,500 pounds of n-pentane are on-site, virtually no isopentane or cyclopentane would be on site at the same time.\n\n\n\nThe process with respect to PSM and RMP regulations starts with the unloading of pentane into the storage tank and continues through the point where cured panels are cut to .  Process steps include transfer of pentane to a metering skid, mixing of pentane with polyol blend, and reaction of the POLY with ISO, using pentane as the expanding agent, to form foam on top of a substrate.  The chemical mixture and substrate are drawn into the laminator oven, where the mixture adheres to the substrate and a top-sheet as the solid foam is formed.   At the crosscut saw station, the sheet is cut into long panels and the edges are trimmed to a precise 4-foot width.  The long panels then move to a gang saw station where additional crosscutting reduces the panels to the desired lengths, typically 4 or 8 feet.  At this point of the process, production of the foam panels using the pentane blowing agent is complete representing the end of the process that is covered under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nHunter Panels maintains a detailed emergency action plan in accordance with 296-24-567 WAC.  The Plant Manager serves as facility coordinator for implementation of the emergency action plan. Employees are trained to respond to minor accidental releases at the facility.  Hunter Panels maintains a relationship with an off"

      "SummaryText": "-site emergency responder for large scale environmental emergencies.  The plan is coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a volatile flammable liquid is defined as the detonation of a vapor cloud of the entire contents of the largest vessel. At Hunter Panels the worst case scenario would be the vaporization and subsequent detonation of the entire contents of the 25,000 gallon pentane storage tank.  Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.\n\n\n\nRMP Comp Version 1.07 was used to estimate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for the worst case release scenario.  The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be approximately 0.1 miles.  Marplot shows no residential population within 0.1 miles of the facility.  However, it is known that at least one residence and at least one business to the south of the pentane tank along Knoble Road E. are within 0.1 miles of the tank.  Estimated population within this distance is 3 persons.  The residential area to the east of the facility is not within 0.1 miles of the tank.\n\n\n\nThe alternate case release scenario modeled is a pool fire involving the release of pentane from a hose rupture during the unloading process.  The release rate is 781-789 lbs per minute into a diked area and it is assumed that the flow of pentane is not stopped until the tank truck is empty (60 minutes).  RMP Comp Version 1.07 was used to estimate the distance to the heat radiation endpoint of 5 kilowatts per square meter as 0.04 miles.  There are no offsite receptors within 0.04 miles of the pentane tank.\n\n\n\nHunter Panels has taken precautions to ensure that the potential for an incident involving pentane is minimal.  Prevention measures include a comprehensive preventive maintenance program, detailed unloading procedures, daily inspections, extensive operator training, and pre-startup inspections for the pentane process.  The RMP program includes the follo"
