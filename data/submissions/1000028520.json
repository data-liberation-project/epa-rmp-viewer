      "SummaryText": "Atlantic Coast Polymers, Inc.'s (ACP's) accidental release prevention program represents a proactive, multi-disciplinary approach to limiting the release of potentially harmful chemicals (as identified in Section 112 [r] of the Clean Air Act) to the environment. ACP's manufacturing facility combines ongoing technological advances, regularly updated material handling procedures, and advanced management practices to protect human health and the environmental from exposure to potentially damaging chemicals used in its manfuacturing process. ACP adheres to all applicable prevention procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (US EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP). ACP's process safety management program's emergency response program includes the preparation of evacuation and notification proceedures (at the facility, local and regional levels), and coordinated emergency response procedures with the Plainfield, Connecticut fire department, the local police department, the local emergency planning committee (Danielson LEPC), and the local health care facility (Plainfield Walk-In Medical Center). \n\n\n\nACP's manufacturing facility is located at 12 East Parkway in Plainfield, Connecticut. The facility stores dimethlyamine (DMA) and formaldyhyde (as Formalin) - both of which are used in the polymerization process - in quantities that exceed the threshold for an RMP. No more than 5,200 gallons of each chemical is stored on this site at any time during the year.\n\n\n\nPolymerization of acrylamide (the primary manufacturing process at this facility) is a proven technology that was first used successfully in the mid to late 1940s. ACP is a manufacturer of water soluble polymers utilizing this technnology. It uses acrylamide monomer, which is first polymerized as a 5% solution in water, in an initial reaction tank. The resultant acrylamide polymer yields a viscous water solution which is pumped to a second reaction tank. To this tank, the following materials are added in"

      "SummaryText": " the following sequence: aqueous 40% dimethylamine (DMA) followed by a 37% formaldehyde (Formalin) solution. The product of the reaction of the two is a 6-7% aminomethylated polyacrylamide solution, which is transferred to bulk storage tanks at the facility and sold in bulk to ACP customers. The principal applications of this product include the use of it as an aid to suspended solids settling in wastewaters, sludge dewatering in sewage treatment plants, and as a processing aid in paper manufacturing.\n\n\n\n40% DMA is a flammable liquid. The bulk storage tank that contains up to 5,200 gallons of DMA is located in a separate, enclosed building located inside the manufacturing building. It is located on a cement pad, surrounded by a cement dike (spill containment system), and separated from the main building by a fire wall. This storage area is considered a confined space and the access door is locked and labeled as such. (Entry is prohibited unless all Confined Space Entry precautions are taken by facility staff).These mechanisms isolate the tank and its contents from the main plant. When manufacturing is initiated, bulk DMA is transferred to a 600 gallon DMA measuring tank with a sight glass, located near the second stage reaction tank. Transfer of the product is observed through this sight glass.\n\n\n\nThe 37% Formalin is a toxic liquid. This solution is transferred from a bulk storage tank also located inside the manufacturing building. It is located on a cement pad and is diked on all sides to prevent any released material from reaching the main plant or the environment. When manufacturing is underway, the Formalin solution is pumped to a 600 gallon measuring tank also fitted with a sight glass to observe product transfer. The contents of the measuring tank are then transferred to the second stage tank where mixing of the Formalin solution and the DMA take place. Mixing and recirculating of the contents of this tank result in a temperature increase of the solution of a"

After the batch is sufficiently mixed, the contents are transferred to the finished product bulk tanks.\n\n\n\nACP's off-site consequence analyses include consideration of two release scenarios involving, individually, DMA and Formalin. These scenarios are identified as \"worst-case\" and \" alternative\". US EPA states that for the worst-case scenario \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes\". The worst-case scenario is to result from an unspecified failure. US EPA defines the alternative scenario as one that is \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the release scenarios is to determine the distance to \"toxic endpoint\", which is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\". Additionally, the residential population within a circle, which is made using the distance to toxic endpoint as its radius, must be defined as an estimate of the population potentially affected. For the purpose of determining worst-case and alternative release scenarios distance to toxic endpoint, ACP utilized US EPA's RMP*Comp software.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Formalin involves the release of 47,320 lbs at the shipping temperature of 100 degrees F. The distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 4.8 miles and the residential population potentially affected was estimated to be 8,400. ACP used, as an alternative release scenario, the rupture of the two inch pipe, which carries the Formalin from the 5,200 gallon storage tank to the mixing tank.

The presence of the fire wall and dike as release mitigation controls were included in the scenario. The distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.3 miles, and the estimated population potentially affected by such a release was determined to be 32. ACP used, as an alternative release scenario, the rupture of the two inch pipe which carries the DMA from the 5,200 gallon storage tank to the mixing tank. The distance to toxic endpoint for this alternative scenario was determined to be 0.20 miles, and the estimated population potentiall affected by such a release was determined to be 15.\n\n\n\nThe ACP process safety management program is based on regular and repeated training of operators, regular updating and implementation of preventive maintenance, auditing and inspection programs (by internal and external auditors), ongoing review and upgrading of process equipment and safety equipment, regular safety training, use of accurate and effective operating procedures (developed with the participation of operators and outside consultants), and regular process hazard reviews of equipment and procedures.\n\n\n\nACP has had no accidental releases of either dimethylamine or formaldehyde (Formalin) at the Plainfield, Connecticut facility in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nACP's Plainfield, Connecticut manufacturing plant has coordinated its emergency planning and response procedures with the Plainfield Fire Department, the Plainfield Police Department and the local (Danielson) LEPC. Procedures, detailed in ACP's process safety management program, have been developed for the effective and timely notification of response personnel and the community, and for the prompt and safe evacuation of employees and the delivery of medical services, as needed."
