(ORM)\n\n\n\n1.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Bear Creek Gas Plant (Facility) has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  ONEOK Rockies Midstream (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees.  Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the jobsite and to safe guard company property through preventative measures.  Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies.  Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\n\n\n\n2.0    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Bear Creek Gas Plant, located near Killdeer, North Dakota, uses mechanical refrigeration, cryogenic extraction and fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL).  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the Facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate).  The Facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\n\n\n3.0    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the"

      "SummaryText": " Facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 368,536 pounds of flammable mixture from the Facility's product surge vessel.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.60 mile. One public and zero environmental receptors were estimated within the 0.60 mile radius. The one public receptor is a residence. The most likely alternate release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance includes transfer hose failures, valve/flange failures, vessel overfilling, and seal leaks. The ARS assumed a 15,000 pound release of propane liquid/vapor over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.30 mile. Zero public and zero environmental receptors were estimated within the 0.30 mile radius.\n\n\n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBear Creek Gas Plant is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program regulation and also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\n5.0    CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Bear Creek Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n?      Release Detection\n\n?      Daily Operator Inspection\n\n?      Monthly Valve, Seal, and Flange Inspections\n\n?      Release Containment/Control\n\n?      Process Relief Valves that prevent vessel over pressurization\n\n?      Valves to Permit Isolation of the Process (manual and automated)\n\n?      Automated Shutdown Systems for Specific Process Parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\n?      Curbing or Diking to Contain Liquid Releases\n\n?      Redundant Equipment and Instrumentation (e.g., emergency power supply, backup pumps, etc.)\n\n?      Release Mitigation, and\n\n?      Personal Protective Equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, FR clothing, etc.).\n\n\n\n6.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Bear Creek Gas Plant is a new plant, designed and built with industry standard safety systems and does not have an accident history.\n\n\n\n7.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Bear Creek Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.

The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other ORM facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  The overall emergency response plan for the Bear Creek Gas Plant is coordinated with the Dunn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan.  The local responders for plant emergencies are the West Dunn Fire District and the Dunn County Sheriff's Department.  The Bear Creek Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organization (e.g., fire department, sheriff's office).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\n8.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Bear Creek Gas Plant will resolve all findings from PHAs, some of which may result in modifications to the process.
