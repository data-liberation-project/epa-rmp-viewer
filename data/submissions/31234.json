      "SummaryText": "CEDAR BAY GENERATING FACILITY\n\nCedar Bay Generating Plant is operated and managed by the National Energy and Gas Transmission Company based in Bethesda, Maryland. The National Energy & Gas Transmission Company operates the Cedar Bay facility in strict accordance with stringent policies and protocols designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, as well as the environment. Responsibility for safety and environmental performance at the plant is shared by every employee. This message is communicated through ongoing training programs designed to raise awareness and build necessary on-the-job skills. Performance in these areas are regularly evaluated through audits, assessments, and other mechanisms, with the goal of measuring progress and identifying areas for continued improvement. \n\nAs is the case for many facilities, Cedar Bay Generating Plant's participation in the RMP program is triggered by the use of only one substance (ammonium hydroxide) on-site in quantities that exceed a threshold amount. At this and other NEGT facilities, ammonia is the key ingredient in the facilities' air pollution control systems. On both the design and operation of our plants, among the most important priorities is the minimization of air emissions, including nitrogen oxides (Nox). Nitrogen Oxides are a primary contributor to smog. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators have identified Nox emissions reductions as one of the most important keys to achieving national air quality improvement goals. In order to help achieve this objective, the Cedar Bay facility employs emissions control technology that uses ammonia to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.\n\nThe Cedar Bay Generating Facility (S.I.C. Code 4911) uses one regulated substance, aqueous ammonia (CAS Number 1336-21-6) in the Selective Non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) process. Aqueous ammonia is routinely delivered at 29 percent ammonia concentration to the facility. \n\nThe hazard assessment"

      "SummaryText": " was performed on the SNCR process using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP*Comp Model. The worst-case release scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire amount of aqueous ammonia in storage for duration of 10 minutes. The alternative release scenario selected for the facility was a failure scenario developed during the process hazard review and analysis. In this scenario, a 0.50-inch diameter drain valve located at the bottom of te storage tank fails and separates from the tank as the result of internal corrosion. The release is contained in the passive mitigation system consisting of an 800 square foot dike containment. For both scenarios, the off-site consequence analysis indicated that off-site receptors could be potentially impacted by the release of aqueous ammonia. Although off-site areas would be impacted, the Facility believes that safety procedures and mitigation measures will reduce the potential for off-site consequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding environment. The Facility's safety devices include alarms and automatic system shut-off devices. \n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), the Facility has developed an accidental release prevention program and emergency action plan.  The accidental release prevention program satisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention program ensures that the Facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental release of aqueous ammonia due to human error or equipment failure is minimized. The program has been written to reduce the potential of an accidental release due to human error or equipment failure. On order to prevent the release of aqueous ammonia due to human error, the Facility's prevention program ensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually. Training also plays a "

      "SummaryText": "vital part in the program.  Employees and contractors working near or on the SNCR process are required to be trained in the process and the hazards of aqueous ammonia.\n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could results in an accidental release, the Facility's program ensures that equipment is inspected, tested, and preventive maintenance performed in accordance with accepted engineering practices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  All equipment pertaining to the SNCR process is maintained, inspected, and tested in accordance with the planned maintenance schedule.\n\nAll existing and proposed future equipment has been designed according to applicable standards and codes.  The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspection and tests.  Precautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested, that all changes on the process are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the SNCR process and to evaluate and control where the potential for an aqueous ammonia release exists.  Employees were involved in determining hazards of the process and subsequent consequences.  The SNCR process was found to be operating safetly and no changes were recommended.\n\nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at the Facility.  Employees have been assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.  The Facility has developed specific programs and forms to assist employees in performing, recording, and documenting the various elements of the RMP.\n\nSince the time of the submittal of the original Risk Management Plan in 1999, there have been no accidental releases of aqueous ammonia at the Facility. However, in the event that there is an accidental release, an Emergency Action Plan has been written in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The Facility is also included in the community emergency respo"

Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 68.90, an Emergency Response Program is not required for the Facility.  In the event that an aqueous ammonia release occurs, all employees are required to evacuate the process area and report the incident.  The emergency action plan consists of evacuation procedures, Facility emergency numbers, and coordination with Jacksonville Fire Rescue Hazardous Materials Management Team.  The plan also addresses notification procedures to the public and the local emergency response agency.\n\nCedar Bay Generating Plant is pleased to share the information in this document.  AS the operators of this facility, NEGT takes seriously its commitment to accident prevention and effective emergency response.  While no industrial site is entirely free from risk, it is our goal, through continuous improvement, to manage risks, as effectively as possible.  This plan demonstrates that the company has the programs in place both to minimize the possibility of a release and to respond to one in the unlikely event that one occurs."
