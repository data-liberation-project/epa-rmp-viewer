      "SummaryText": "West Biloxi Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n\n\nRMP Plan Executive Summary\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nThis executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the West Biloxi Wastewater Treatment Plant (West Biloxi WWTP), one of several facilities owned by the Harrison County Utility Authority and Operated by Utility Partners.\n\n\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nUtility Partners believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Utility Partners has developed proactive safety and environment programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the West Biloxi WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  Utility Partners has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the West Biloxi WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, Utility Partners affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\n\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no release would occur.  Accoordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequence of a release should on occur.\n\n\n\nUtility Partners takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the faciliti"

      "SummaryText": "es it operates by ensuring that itsemployees are well-informed requarding the hazards associated with the requlated processes (e.g., chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the West Biloxi WWTP) and actively participated in comprehensive process hazard analyses.  The employees that work on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\n\n\nUtility Partners management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and reference in the West Biloxi WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe West Biloxi WWTP is located at 370 Rosalie Maria Drive, in Biloxi, Harrison County, Mississippi.  The West Biloxi WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  This acitvated sludge plant has aerobic digester, a 2.0 meter belt filter press, and secondary clarification.  Average design flow is 9.0 MGD, with a peak capacity of 27.1 MGD.  Sludge is transported to a disposal site by a separate contractor.  Optech developed an equipment repair program and an ongoing training program.\n\nThe West Biloxi WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of six containers (12,000 pounds) on site.  In addition, the West Biloxi WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of five containers (10,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the West Biloxi WWTP is requlated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide store and used at the facility.\n\n\n"

Management of changes procedures will be used for the upgrades to the sulfur dioxide system.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of the RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has established and maintains and emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the Biloxi Fire Department.  The program is described in detail in the West Biloxi WWTP RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which included facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\n\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meeting that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the West Biloxi WWTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazard and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\n\n\nAs part of the development of the West Biloxi WWTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Through not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all a affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process."
