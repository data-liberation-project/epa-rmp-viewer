In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. \n\n\nDescription of our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and rail, is handled and stored on-site, and is a substance regulated by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  \n\nThis facility maintains approximately fifty-eight 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and eleven 1450 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 345,360 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in three stationary storage tanks [1 @ 12,000 gallons; 1 @ 18,000 gallons & 1 @ 30,000 gallons] on site.  The maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tanks is 280,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity is 625,360 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 140,000 pounds.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank coupled to a 100 ton rail car , when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 310,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would hav"

The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All main storage tank valves and riser valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process, or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification, and on the job training.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous am"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, this location has an Emergency Action Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA  The plan includes provisions for public notification, initial medical care, evacuations, and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nWe  plan to make  changes to the physical site by 2/1/03 to be in compliance with new Indiana State Chemist regulations.. We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures. We will also provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
