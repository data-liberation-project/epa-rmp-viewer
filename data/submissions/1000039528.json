Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Mermentau Facility is subject to Preventative Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility does not have permanent full-time employees on-site.  \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility was taken out of service in 2008 and placed back into service in March 2010.  The most recent RMP reinstatement and recertification was completed in June 2012.  The Facility added an additional natural gasoline tank, which increased the Facility storage capacity and triggered this RMP revision.  A Process Hazard Analysis was completed for the process revisions in December 2012, and the new tank was brought online in December 20"

The following information serves as a complete RMP 5-year recertification.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains a policy of safe natural gasoline and butane handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the handling of flammable materials, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.    \n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a butane or natural gasoline release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility receives natural gasoline, n-Butane and isobutane via pipeline for storage and subsequent off-loading via barge.  Although the current facility Material Safety Data Sheet for natural gasoline lists it as a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Class 3 flammable; subsequent testing completed by EnLink demonstrates that the mixture would, at times, be considered an NFPA Class 4 flammable based upon the flash point and boiling point of the mixture.  As such, EnLink has chosen to include natural gasoline in the RMP-regulated inventory at the Facility.  Natural gasoline may include the following RMP-regulated flammable substances: isopentane and n-pentane. The maximum inventory of natural gasoline at the Facility at any given time is 4,252,500 gallons (23,067,452 lbs).  The largest vessel that stores natural gasoline has a capacity of 2,520,000 gallons (13,669,601 lbs).\n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility also receives n-butane and/or isobutane, which are regulated flammable mixtures.  N-Butane is a flammable mixture that contains n-butane, pentane and isobutane; and isobutene is a flammable mixture that contains isobutane, n-butane and propane. N-butane and/or isobutane are stored interchangeably in one of three pressurized vessels.  The maximum inventory of n-"

The largest vessel containing either n-butane or isobutane at the Facility has a capacity of 472,500 gallons (2,370,624 lbs). \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of n-butane, isobutane and natural gasoline. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. The Mermentau Facility's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation; \n\n?    Process Safety Information; \n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis; \n\n?    Operating Procedures; \n\n?    Training; \n\n?

Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Mermentau Facility has had no accidental releases of flammable materials regulated under the RMP program that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to April 2014.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM rule. The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \n\n\n\n?    Public and emergency response agency notification procedures; \n\n?    Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \n\n?    Emergency response measures; \n\n?    Procedures for inspecting, testing, and"

Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM rule are included in the Mermentau Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.   \n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nEnLink has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary.
