      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThis facility, Woodland Biomass, handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered a hazardous material. The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility\u00bfs workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility\u00bfs policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility is a 28-megawatt (MW), biomass-fired, electrical power generating facility. The plant burns agricultural and wood fuels in a fluidized bed boiler to generate high pressure steam which drives a turbine generator.\n \nAmmonia vapor is used at the plant to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in the boiler flu gas.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received at the plant via a liquefied-gas tank-truck and stored in a single 20,000-gallon capacity tank.\n\n3a. Administrative Controls\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia system and the training provided to the ammonia system operators.\n\n3b. Mitigation Measures\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "d Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety meetings and safety training. The Process Safety management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia-related activities and equipment represents one of the facility\u00bfs main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases occurred within the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personal at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the local Fire Department and other agency emergency response teams at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated. Yolo County can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n \n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nCommitments made under the State of California\u00bfs Risk Management Plan (RMP) and their related activities are being implemented at this time. Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the ammonia system."
