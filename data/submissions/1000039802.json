Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.

The break-a-way devises allow for complete shut down of the hose end and the valve on the riser pipe thus prevening any relaseas.\r\n\r\nThere are no other additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendatio at this time."
