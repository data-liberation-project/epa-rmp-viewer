      "SummaryText": "The City of Washington has an emergency Response Plan in effect and has implemented OSHA's Process Safety Management Program to deal with regulated substances used on a daily basis.\n\nThe City operates the Regional Water Treatment Plant located just off Highway 264 across from Beaufort County Community College. In the disinfection process of treating our potable water supply, we use chlorine, which is stored on site in one ton cylinders.  We may have as much as five tons on site after a delivery from our chemical supplier.\n\nThe worst case scenario was developed as a release quanity of 2000 pounds in 10 minutes, with a distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles. The alternative scenario was a release quanity of 180 pounds in 60 minutes with an end point of 0.1 miles. There are no passive mitigation measures in place. Any active mitigation measures would be applied by the Haz-Mat team and support personnel of the City of Washington Fire/Rescue Department. An Emergency Response Plan is in place to supplement Administrative controls.\n\nAs of this date we have not had a reportable release quantity of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nWe have formulated an Emergency Response Plan in conjunction with the Washington Fire/Rescue Department and  have conducted joint drills."
