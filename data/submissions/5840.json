Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Jamela Water Treatment Plant is owned by the City of Ocoee.  The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.\n\n2.    Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Jamela  Water Treatment Plant is located in the center of a residential area on Jamela Drive, in Ocoee, Orange County, Florida.  The City of Ocoee uses chlorine as a disinfectant for water treatment process.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to four one-ton containers at the chlorination process building.  Two one-ton containers are always connected to the process, while up to two additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 8,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is not enclosed in a building, but sheltered with a three-sided metal shed.\n\n3.    Description of the Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario is the rupture of a one-ton container from the chlorination process, releasing 2,000 lbs. of chlorine gas over a 10-minute period.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the chlorine gas could travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L), using the WWTP Guidance look-up tables.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario is characterized by a release of liquid chlorine due to a failure of the liquid supply valve connection from worker/human error, external impact, or corrosion.  For the chlorination (Chlorine) process, the release rate was determined to be 1,.387lbs/min.  Under normal expected weather conditions, the chlorination process chlorine gas could travel .60 miles before"

      "SummaryText": " dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L), using the WWTP Guidance Lookup Table.\n\n4.Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility is exempt from  the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119., because it meets the definition of an unoccupied remote facility.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Jamela Chlorination process in the Program 2 level.  The Jamela facility will address all elements for the Prevention Program 2 as required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n5.    Accident History\n\nThe Jamela facility has had one accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years, and it was due to a failed lead washer.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Jamela WTP has an Emergency Response Plan in place.   The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has a procedure for addressing small releases of chlorine.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Ocoee Fire Department and Orange County Fire Department.  Notification is made locally by automated dialing 407-656-7796 and by notification of the Florida State Warning Point    ."
