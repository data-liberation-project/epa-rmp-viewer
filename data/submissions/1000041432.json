Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane, lubricating oils, wax and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has the multiple flammable mixtures that include the following RMP-regulated flammables; methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, isobutane, butane, butene, isopentane, pentane, 1-pentene, and hydrogen. The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting. The refinery's  process units containing RMP-covered flammable materials are considered a single program 3 covered process.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Holly Tulsa Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each applicable OSHA PSM element and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery encourages employees to participate in all elements of process saf"

Examples include (1) control of entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery has a comprehensive electronic computer system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemical technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. Any change, which has a potential impact on quantities of new or existing toxic or flammable hydrocarbons, must be review by the RMP Coordinator. Documentation of employee training on the change is covered under PSSR.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a sim"

For each process area, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g.; temperature, level, pressure) and studied hazard scenarios via the Process Hazards Analysis process. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis, What-If technique and Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to perform these evaluations. HAZOP and What-If analysis are recognized as the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. LOPA is a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology that involves the quantitative evaluation of a qualitative hazard scenario(s) to determine if the existing safeguards are adequate. The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team with experience back"

Employees participate in our Joint Health, Safety and Environmental committee. Also, teams are involved in Job Hazards Analysis for nonroutine tasks, Safety Scorecard Program, and Safety Survey Program, in which our employees provide their services performing various audits and enhancing their safety awareness. Our process unit operators monitor their areas of responsibility and provide monthly reports on the status of various safety and emergency response equipment. All Holly Tulsa Refinery employees participate in the Total Event Reporting process where near misses and incidents are reported and tracked.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information (PSI). Each process unit has its specific PSI training material for the operating personnel.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).
