Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and, we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFive year accident history\n\nWe keep records for all near misses and significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a regulated toxic chemical, is the failure of a storage tank containing 4,000 gallons of ammonia.  The storage quantity in the tank is limited to 75% of the tank capacity by Global procedure and the scenario assumes a 10-minute release time.  The distance to the endpoint under the guidelines established by EPA is potentially 2.2 miles before enough vapor is dispersed to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the disconnection of a loading line from a bulk truck to the ammonia storage tank.  The emergency shutdown system stops the flow instantly.  The total loss of product is 13 pounds, which results in the endpoint under the guidelines set by EPA, of 0.06 miles, before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a regulated flammable chemical is the failure of a storage tank containing isobutylene.  The senario for the propylene/propane mixture was evaluated but was found to be not as significant as a release of isobutylene. The storage quantity of isobutylene in the tank is limited to 75% of the tank capacity by Global procedure and the scenario assumes a 10-minute release time.  The distance to the endpoint under the guidelines established by EPA is potentially 1.1 miles before enough vapor is dispersed to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario, is the fail"
