A full-time staff of safety and health professionals support this strong commitment to safety and health.\n\n\n\nThe Platte South Water Treatment Plant is one of three water treatment facilities supplying drinking water to the City of Omaha, Nebraska and surrounding communities.  Liquid chlorine is used for disinfection.  Only chlorine at the Platte South Water Treatment Plant falls under the RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nThe responsibility for implementation and handling of the District's Risk Management Plan rests with the Vice President of Water Operations.

Equipment installed to facilitate the chlorination process and facilities to house chlorine are inspected periodically, and scheduled maintenance is performed to ensure system safety and reliability.\n\n\n\nSafety information necessary to ensure the facilities and processes meet or exceed codes, standards, and/or guidelines used in the development and installation of regulated requirements has been compiled and reviewed where appropriate.

The review included siting, operation and maintenance, hazard recognition, human factors, container shipment and unloading, piping and appurtenances, and general conditions.  Any areas identified as needing further research were annotated and followed up on to ensure proper measures were implemented to correct deficiencies and mitigate hazards.  Using Hazard Reviews and Compliance audits, we will continue to use the deficiencies identified to improve safety.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures used within the Risk Management Plan are addressed in the District's Chlorine Manual.  This manual addresses normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, startup following turnaround, consequences of deviation, steps required to correct or avoid deviation, safety and health considerations, and safety systems.  The District does not have any procedures for start-up or temporary operations, as disinfection is a permanent process.  Chlorine manuals are located at the Operator's desk and in the Plant Director's office.\n\n\n\nTraining includes Hazmat training for all Chemical Equipment Mechanics, operating procedure training for operating employees, and safety and health training and awareness training for all District employees involved directly with the chlorination process. \n\n \n\nCompliance audits are conducted at least every three years using the checklist provided in the RMP plan for the Water Industry published by the American Water Works Association.
