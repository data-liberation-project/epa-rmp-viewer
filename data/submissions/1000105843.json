Each element is reviewed and updated with frequencies in accordance with regulations on the EPA and OSHA standards.\n\n-Five-Year Accident History-\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred at the Bimbo Bakehouse facility in the last 5 years. A sample accident report can be found in the Process Safety Management Files. \n\n-Emergency Response Program-\n\nThe Bimbo Bakehouse facility's employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, and, therefore, an Emergency Response Program is not required. In place of the Emergency Response Program, the facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan and is included in the community's emergency response plan.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan is kept with the Process Safety Management Files. \n\n-Planned Changes to Improve Safety-\n\nBased upon ColonialWebb Contractor recommendations, the facility has begun the following plans to improve safety. These items will be assigned responsible parties, tracked and implemented, or closed out with proper justification, to ensure the facility's ammonia refrigeration systems continue to operate safely.\n\n1.\tComplete Ammonia Operator 1 Training\n2.\tHire an additional experienced technician\n3.\tConduct weekly PSM meetings\n4.\tComplete findings and recommendations generated from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, Mechanical Integrity Audit, and Compliance Audit."

Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and are improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n-Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled-\n\nThe Bimbo Bakehouse facility includes two ammonia refrigeration systems (System A and System B) to provide process cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) contained in each of the systems is in excess of 10,000 pounds. The maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in System A is 28,182 lbs. of ammonia, the maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in System B is 20,364 lbs. For the purposes of the RMP submission, the EPA considers these two systems to be one single process with a maximum quantity held in the calendar year of 49,000 lbs. Since an ammonia release from the systems could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulated, the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n-The Prevention Program:-\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses on efforts at the Bimbo Bakehouse facility to contain the refrigerant inside the systems. The goal is to reduce the risk of injury and promote safer practices at the Bimbo Bakehouse facility. The following items are included in the Prevention Program in relation to requirements for Program Level 3.\n\n1.\tEmployee Participa"

The Risk Management Plan for the Bimbo Bakehouse facility has been prepared for the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia in the facility's refrigeration system. Each part of the RMP is submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency, meeting or exceeding the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. \n\nThe submission is due to the need to fulfill the requirements mandated by the EPA for a new submission or an update to occur every 5 years. The RMP was resubmitted in accordance with the 5-year update requirement. The RMP resubmission was completed on 7/6/2023.\n\n-Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response or Emergency Action Policies-\n\nThe Bimbo Bakehouse facility recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment and property. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The controls of accidents have been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Bimbo Bakehouse facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established an Emergency Action Plan. The objectives of the Emergency Action Plan are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response or action programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation.
