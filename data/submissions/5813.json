      "SummaryText": "\n\nDescription:   \nLamanuzzi & Pantaleo has been in the grape/raisin industry for over 60 years.  We grow, pack, ship and sell table grapes, raisins, etc. \n\nRegulated Substance: \nThe only toxic substance we handle above the federal threshold levels is Sulfur Hydroxide (Anhydrous). Sulfur hydroxide is used to bleach the raisins.  It has a strong 'rotten egg\" odor and is easily detected by the human nose.  We use this chemical during post-harvest (for approximately 100 days per year) and then return it to the supplier when the season is over.\n\n\nSafety Features:  \nThe metal tanks that store the sulfur dioxide have recessed valves which protected against accidental damage to the valves.  We have trained personnel who are responsible for the application and have many years of experience working with this chemical.   The tanks are have 3 fusible plugs built into them to protect against pressure build up during a fire.  Sulfur dioxide is not considered a fire hazard.\n\nAccident History:  \nThere have been no reported accidents related to sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) reported in the last 5 years.\n \n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\nWhen utilizing the EPA provided RMP COMP modeling software for the worst case scenario, the distance calculated to the toxic endpoint was 1.3 miles.  \n\n\nAlternative-Case Scenario:\nThe EPA modeling software for the alternative-case scenario calculated the distance to toxic endpoint at 0.3 miles.  \n\n\nEmergency Response:\nThe First Responders for this dehydrator would be the Madera County Fire Department.  \n\n\nPlanned changes:  \nWe have scheduled follow up training with our sulfur dioxide supplier in August of 1999.  We have scheduled a fire department inspection for July of 1999."
