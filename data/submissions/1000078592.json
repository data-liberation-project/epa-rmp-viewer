This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency response organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in other sections of this RMP.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n \n\nThe St. Regis Gas Plant, located about 2 miles west of Jay, Florida, and A? mile north of State Road 4, consists of one Program Level 3 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, sulfur recovery, cryogenic) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) and sulfur from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  The gas plant could contain regulated flammables (e.g., mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, and iso-pentane) in excess of the threshold quantity established in the regulation.  The facility also processes hydrogen sulfide, a listed toxic substance, but the maximum potential inventory is less than the listed threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  All transportation of regulated flammables into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines and truck loading.  The gas plant is surrounded by rural farmland, residences, and forest.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the St. Regis Gas Plant.

Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the Plant and addresses each program element.  In addition, the Plant has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThe St. Regis Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The PSM committee is assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in materials safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplmented by documents that "

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the PSM operating procedures. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe St. Regis Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe St. Regis Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique and checklist to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, safety and engineering experience. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team suggests possible additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\n\n\n\nThese suggestions are forwarded to local and corpora"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive appropriate attention. All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each suggestion is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews will comply with OSHA 40 CFR 1910. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe St. Regis Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations (not used by Breitburn), (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  In addition, the St. Regis Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documentd for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe St. Regis Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) undestand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the St. Regis Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performances during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performanc"

If a deficiency is identified, appropriate corrective actions will be taken before placing the equiupment back into service. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program requires a management of change (MOC) team to review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The St. Regis Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe St. Regis Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and proces safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the  entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe St. Regis Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, tehnology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findigns, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly; an audit is conducted at the St. Regis Gas Plant at least once every 3 years to determine whether the program's procedures and practices are being implemented.  An audit team consisting of both Gas Plant and technical personnel evaluate the implementation/effectiveness of the processes in this accident prevention program and develop findings that are documented and forwarded to management to coordinate resolution.
