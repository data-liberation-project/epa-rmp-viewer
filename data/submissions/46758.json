As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112\u00ae Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Sioux River Ethanol has reviewed the original risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds and have updated the information to provide current chemical information usage at the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nSioux River Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.   The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption as required by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms regualtions.  It is the policy of Sioux River Ethanol to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of denaturant, it is the policy of Sioux River Ethanol to notify the Lincoln County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 40 percent pentane (we used 60% for reporting), an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 339,300 pounds (total pentane is 203,580 pounds), an RMP regulated substance.  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is"

Sioux River Ethanol has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to pentane.  An emergency action plan for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Sioux River Ethanol has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Sioux River Ethanol has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nSioux River Ethanol has not had any accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  This facility has been in operation since May 2004."
