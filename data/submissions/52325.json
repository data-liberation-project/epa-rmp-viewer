This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Union County Sheriff which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include ammonia, bromine, chlorine, phosgene [carbonic dichloride], and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.   Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization.  Bromine is used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] is used for chemical synthesis.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for  bromine recovery and scavenging.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of bromine at our facility is 3,488,993 lb. while chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] are present at our facility in quantities of 1,800,000 lb., 158,000 lb., 114,000 lb., and 72,000 lb. respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limi"

For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in RMP Comp.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of two railroad tank cars of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, a distance of some miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from a pipe leak on the ammonia storage tanks in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 500 lbs. of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.1 mile.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for bromine involves a release from a pipe leak on the bromine storage tanks in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 750 lbs. of bromine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released over 10 minutes to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 11.3 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L of bromine is 1.0 mile.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a pipe leak at the rail car unloading area in the Bromine Ref"

The scenario involves the release of 20 lbs. of sulfur dioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the maximum disatance to the toxic endpoint of .0078 mg/L of sulfur dioxide is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for phosgene [carbonic dichloride] involves a release from a pipe leak on the phosgene cylinders in the TCO Unit process.  The scenario involves the release of 600 lb. of phosgene [carbonic dichloride] in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.00081 mg/L of phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] is 3.7 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State of Arkansas Building Code.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGreat Lakes Chemical, Central Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive"
