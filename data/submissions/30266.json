The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary exposure, to reduce the threat to our own health and that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which the chemicals are handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe purpose of this facility is to provide treatment of wastewater generated within the City of Elizabethtown.  The regulated substances stored on site are chlorine and sulfur dioxide, both of which are used in the treatment process to produce an effluent that meets Federal and State standards.  The maximum total inventory of chemicals stored on site is 12,000 pounds of chlorine and 12,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  Chemical vendors supply the chlorine and sulfur dioxide to the facility by truck in one (1) ton containers.\n\n3.  The worst-case and alternate release scenarios, including mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nFailure of one (1) ton sulfur dioxide cylinder would release 2,000 pounds of  chemical.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as gas, which is heavier than air.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L was determined by the EPA's RMP* Comp Ver 1.07 model to be 3.1 miles.  Public receptors within the distance are schools, residences, recreational areas, and industrial areas.  The estimated residential population within the 3.1 mile radius is 4429.\n\nSulfur dioxide was used in the scenario becau"

This release occurs indoors so the release is reduced to 55% of 18.2 lb/min to 10 lb/min.  Six hundred pounds of chlorine is released in one (1) hour before emergency services repair the leak.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L was determined by the EPA's RMP* Comp Ver 1.07 model to be 0.1 miles.  The estimated residentail population within the 0.1 mile radius is 0.\n\nTubing failure or a bad connection on one (1) ton cylinder of sulfur dioxide results in the release of gas through a 3/8\" line.  This release occurs indoors so the release is reduced to 55% of 7.3 lb/min to 4.1 lb/min.  Two hundred fifity pounds of sulfur dioxide is released in one (1) hour before emergency services repair the leak.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L was determined by the EPA's RMP* Comp Ver 1.07 model to be 0.1 miles.  The estimated residential population within the 0.1 mile radius is 0.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis facility has developed a program with policies that meet the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history\n\nThis facility has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n\nSince facility personnel will only respond to incidental releases, we are required to develop an emergency action plan to ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan.  The Elizabethtown Fire Department will respond to and mitigate any threat posed by an accidental release of a regulated chemical from our facilty.  The facility is included in t"
