The Muller-Pinehurst Dairy is subject to the United States Environmental Protection AgencyA?s (USEPAA?s) Risk Management Program(RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) (Chemical Abstract System Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream, milk, and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 13,800 pounds (i.e., 2600 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, Liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 2,840 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only about 1,300 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  \nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although, exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personal exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping and equipment.\n2.0    Process Description A? The Muller-Pinehurst Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system.  The high pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (135 to 190 psig) liquid ammonia to several units including the 3 barrel ice cream freezer, lower cooler units, Mueller vat, ante room units, glycol chiller, small hardening room units, new cooler addition, and McDonaldA?s doc"

The receiver also feeds ammonia to the intercooler which in turn feeds additional units including storage area unit, large hardening room unit, small hardening room unit #1, new and old ice builders, and half gallon air units 1 through 3.    \nThe Mueller vat, hardening rooms, storage area and ante room units return liquid / vapor ammonia to one suction trap.  The suction trap is designated to supply liquid free suction to the booster compressors.  Booster compressors supply ammonia vapor from the intercooler is fed to one of six high stage compressors (four reciprocating compressors and two screw compressors).  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot gas), at 135 to 190 psig, is vented to two condensing towers.  The condensed liquid is returned to the high-pressure receiver.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems / hardware, including safety relief valves, compressor ventilation controlled by ammonia detectors, and system safety interlocks.  The safety relief valves protects the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, and the intercooler from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks, include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors as well as high level floats and sensors for the system vessels.  The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig. \nA release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\nA?    Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion.\nA?    Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality controls of these lines;\nA?    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\nA?    Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from forklifts;\nA?    The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintai"

The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel.\n3.0        Prevention Program A? The facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental release of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios required by 40 CFR 68.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\nA?    The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nA?     The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\nA?    The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \"What-if/checklist\" technique.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; ("

Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\nA?    Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\nA?    Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \n\nA?    Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\n\nA?
