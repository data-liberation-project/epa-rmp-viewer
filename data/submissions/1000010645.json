Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream, milk, and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 13,800 pounds (i.e., 2600 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, Liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 2,840 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only about 1,300 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  \nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although, exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personal exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping and equipment.\n2.0\tProcess Description \u00c2\u00bf The Muller-Pinehurst Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system.  The high pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (135 to 190 psig) liquid ammonia to several units including the 3 barrel ice cream freezer, lower cooler units, Mueller vat, ante room units, glycol chiller, small hardening room units, new cooler addition, and McDonald\u00c2\u00bfs doc"

The safety relief valves protects the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, and the intercooler from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks, include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors as well as high level floats and sensors for the system vessels.
