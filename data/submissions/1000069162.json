Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\r\n\r\nAt Don's Cold Storage, we utilize anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by the\r\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA). The properties that make ammonia valuable as a\r\nrefrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions. Don's strives to protect all its valuable\r\nresources and assets-both personnel and property. We live and have families in this community.\r\nWe want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community,\r\nexisting natural resources, and the surrounding environment. It is our policy to comply with all\r\nFederal, State, and Local regulations. Through continual, accurate training and various safety\r\ndevices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\n\r\nOur emergency action plan has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous\r\nammonia as well as other emergencies. We work in conjunction with the Webb City Fire Department\r\nand the Jasper County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification\r\nof all affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods. We\r\nutilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing. An outside company\r\nis used to fill our main receiver tanks. Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or\r\nfreezing units. Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management\r\npersonnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum amount of\r\nammonia stored at this facility is 19,697 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including\r\nAdministrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to limit the Distances for each reported Scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario would be failure"

The only time the receiver would be this full would be during a pump-down of the system,\r\nwhich only occurs during a construction project or certain maintenance projects and the procedure is\r\nstrictly monitored.\r\nDistance to endpoint: .9 miles\r\n\r\nAlternative Scenario\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure relief\r\nvalve. The maximum time of the release would be 30 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 4,143\r\npounds of Ammonia.\r\nDistance to endpoint: 0.1 miles \r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History.\r\n\r\nThis is a newly constructed facility that opened in 2018. To date, Don's Cold Storage\r\nfacility has not incurred a reportable release.\r\n\r\n5. The RMP Management Program.\r\n\r\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by the PSM Manager. He/She will\r\nadministrate in conjunction with the Don's Cold Storage management and personnel. Other entities\r\nor organizations that will be coordinated to include the Jasper County Local Emergency Planning\r\nCommittee and the Webb City Fire Department.\r\n\r\n6. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\r\n\r\nDon's Cold Storage facility complies with all applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations\r\nincluding the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule. Our personnel are trained about this\r\nduring our Hazard Communications Training, and through access to our Written Programs. Our\r\nRefrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom and On-The-Job training.\r\nThey are given oral tests and are observed and able to demonstrate proper job skills and\r\nknowledge. Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested, and maintained to the standard of\r\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.\r\n\r\n7. T"
