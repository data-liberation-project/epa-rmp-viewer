Difluoroethane is a flammable gas, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and reduce health threats to our workers and the nearby community.  Safety depends on:\n\n(1) The manner in which we handle this material;\n(2) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility;\n(3) Operating and maintenance procedures; and\n(4) Employee training.\n\nThe President has overall authority for the safety program at the Lakewood facility.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to receive and store difluoroethane and then use this material as propellants in aerosol containers.  Difluoroethane is the only material handled at the facility that is subject to the EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the hydrocarbon system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation, and New Jersey's TCPA Act.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n(1) Employee Participation Program\n(2) Process Safety Information\n(3) Process Hazard Analysis\n(4) Operating Procedures\n(5) Training Program\n(6) Contractor Safety Program\n(7) Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n(8) Mechanical Integrity Program\n(9) Hot Work Permit Procedures\n(10) Management of Change Procedures\n(11) Incident Investigation Procedures\n(12) Compliance Audit Procedures\n(13) Trade Secrets Procedures\n(14) Management System\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\nThere have not been any accidents in the previous five years at the Lakewood facility that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\n5. The Emergence Action Program:\nThe emergency action plan for thi"

Our emergency action plan details employee actions and includes procedures for notification of the local Fire Department and the local LEPC.  If the release is beyond the capabilities of facility personnel, representatives from the Fire Department would be called to respond to the incident.\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSeveral recommendations identified during a recent safety review involve changes to improve safety, including the installation of a gas detection system and an emergency shut-off valve.  These changes will be implemented over the upcoming months."
