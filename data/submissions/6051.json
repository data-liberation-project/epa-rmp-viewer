      "SummaryText": "National Semiconductor Corporation currently owns and operates a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Arlington, Texas.  The National Semiconductor Texas (NSTE) facility, is located at 1111 West Bardin Road in Arlington (Tarrant County), Texas and occupies approximately 67 acres.  NSTE has an air permit for three fabrication lines at their facility. Currently, NSTE operates all three of the fab lines, Fab I, Fab II, and Fab III.  The production activities at the plant are conducted entirely inside the buildings.\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, specifically the general duty clause, applies to the NSTE Semiconductor Manufacturing Plant because the plant handles and stores a total 1,000 pounds of aqueous hydrochloric (HCl) acid. The aqueous hydrochloric (HCl) acid is pressurized and converted to anhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas, which feeds the horizontal furnaces and Epi reactors.  Although NSTE does not exceed the threshold for HCl acid (15,000 pounds), or HCl gas (5,000 pounds), NSTE has elected to complete a Risk Management Plan to demonstrate compliance with the \"general duty clause\" of Section 112(r).  NSTE believes this clause applies to operations at the plant.\n\n'112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. National Semiconductor commits to the safe operation of the NSTE Semiconductor Manufacturing Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  NSTE therefore has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Arlington Fire Department.\nFor planning purposes, NSTE has considered"

      "SummaryText": "the impact of a \"worst case\" accident, defined to be a total failure of a nickel-lined \"tonner\" tank resulting in a 500-pound release of hydrochloric acid.  Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) RMP*Comp methodology, a potential radius of impact due to the release was calculated to extend to 0.2 miles.  Demographic information based on the 1990 census indicates that no people live within this radius.  It should be emphasized that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote - far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.  A consideration of the 0.2-mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\nNSTE has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  NSTE has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures.  NSTE also provides annual emergency response training to its employees. In addition, NSTE has coordinated with local emergency responders including the Arlington Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\nNSTE management is committed to the following:\n- Preventing accidents;\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness; and\n- Being a good corporate citizen of Tarrant County.\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with semiconductor manufacturing.  Most important, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
