The employees receive periodic refresher training and participate in annual emergency response exercises.\n\n\n\nCrest Foam Industries Incorporated (Crest Foam) uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) to manufacturer flexible polyurethane foam products.  TDI is received at the facility in tank truck and stored in aboveground storage tanks.\n\n\n\nCrest Foam has developed a comprehensive program for the safe handling of TDI at their facility in Moonachie, New Jersey.  The program was initially developed in September 1988 for the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  The program has successfully operated since that time and has undergone regular audit by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP).  The facility Risk Management Plan (RMP) was upgraded in March 2010 from a Program level 2 to Program level 3 as New Jersey has eliminated the Program level 2. The RMP has been developed in accordance with the federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) and the New Jersey TCPA rules and consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n\n\n        Process Safety Information\n\n        Process Hazard Analysis\n\n        Standard Operating Procedures\n\n        Combined Employee Training Program\n\n        TDI Preventative Maintenance Program\n\n        Management of Change\n\n        Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n        Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n        EHS Accident or Potentially Catastrophic Event Investigation Procedures\n\n        Employee Participation Program\n\n        Hot Work Permit\n\n        Procedures for Outside Contract Employees\n\n        Combined Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have not been any TDI related accidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response program.
