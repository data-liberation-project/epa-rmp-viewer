      "SummaryText": "tem and AF-AFFF foam system during all transfers.\r\nBSC also uses titanium tetrachloride.  It is stored in DOT cylinders holding 1500 lbs.  It is not a flammable material but is toxic. Although BSC does not exceed the threshold of 2500 lbs in a single process, it is being included due to the total quantity on site.\r\nBSC is reporting dimethylamine as we reached the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  It is also a flammable liquid. BSC receives the chemical is 550 lb DOT cylinders.\r\nEquipment covered under the PSM standard (and the RMP rule) includes the storage tank, cylinders, transfer piping, and Micro Motion meter connected to the storage tank. Under the RMP rule, each facility is required to develop a worst-case scenario, which assumes that the maximum quantity in the process (entire contents of storage tank) is instantly vaporized, and explodes. The analysis of this worst-case scenario indicates a radius of impact of 0.2 miles for ethyl ether, which extends to the west of the property boundary into a residential area in the town of Mead. As EPA points out in their guidance documents, these distances do not represent the likely result of an incident. The alternate scenario for a BLEVE involving ethyl ether will produce impact distances of less than 0.2 miles, which would have the same impact area as the worst-case scenario. The worst case and alternate scenario for dimethylamine is 0.1 miles.  This is approximately 500 feet which could impact a storage facility to the east of the property. A toxic release of titanium tetrachloride worst case impact is 0.5 miles and alternate case is 0.1 miles.  The worst case scenario could impact residential property to the west and north and the storage facility east of the site.\r\nIn the event of an emergency release, BSC has written and tested a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan. Coordinated through Mountain View Fire Department, the Plan describes what steps are to be taken in the event of a major fire or chemical release."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nBoulder Scientific (BSC) operates a specialty chemical production facility in Mead, Colorado. Several chemicals are on the RMP list including ethyl ether, titanium tetrachloride, dichlorodimethylsilane, phosphorus trichloride and dimethylamine.  Dichlorodimethylsilane and phosphorus trichloride are not above the RMP threshold quantity. \r\nEthyl ether exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold in two containers.  Ethyl ether is used in some reaction processes; the largest container is a portable isotainer holding 6,340 gallons.  There are currently two on site. Ethyl ether can also be stored in C-430 cylinders (370 gallons) and C-120 cylinders (120 gallons). It is transferred from the isotainer (only when located under the tanker bridge) via fixed pipe to a metering location (Micro Motion) and then into reaction vessels via chemical hoses.  The transfer process into a reaction vessel is a PSM and RMP process.  The hose is then disconnected from the reaction vessel.  The storage and transfer of ethyl ether is regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, and BSC developed a number of safety protocols and procedures when the PSM standard was implemented in 1996. In addition to the normal safeguards associated with handling flammable liquids, BSC implemented detailed written procedures for all ethyl ether transfers. These procedures were reviewed in detail by the PSM committee to systematically identify potential hazards and eliminate or reduce risks associated with each hazard. All personnel handling ethyl ether receive special training in handling flammable liquids and the unique hazards associated with ethyl ether.  BSC has not had a significant incident involving ethyl ether.  In addition to the procedure and operating equipment safety reviews (including PHAs), accident risk is further reduced by locating the ethyl ether isotainer in a diked area to prevent migration of spilled liquids and by fire protection from a high-volume sprinkler sys"
