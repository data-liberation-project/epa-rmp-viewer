As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the four gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in a dedicated, specially designed storage tank.  The storage capacity of the tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  Additionally, the facility uses chlorine in its water treatment facility.  Chlorine is stored in up to three pressurized cylinders, one of which is connected for use at any one time.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPCF is subject to OSHA's PSM standard and Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention program at PCF includes:\n\nEmployee Participation\nAll PCF employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prev"

Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis.  Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nPCF maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI data is updated when changes in the process occur.  Information concerning the hazards of ammonia and chlorine is found on Material Safety Data Sheets, which are maintained for all hazardous chemicals.\n\nInformation concerning the process technology includes process flow information, maximum intended inventory information, safe upper and lower process limits, and consequences of deviating from safe limits.\n\nInformation concerning the process equipment includes the materials of construction, piping specifications, piping and instrument diagrams, relief design calculations and design basis, design codes and standards employed, safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nPCF has a comprehensive PHA program to ensure that  hazards associated with the ammonia and chlorine processes are systematically identified and controlled.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  The plant has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nPCF maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations,"

The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually.  Safe work practices such as hot work, lockout, and line breaking, are referenced in operating procedures, where applicable.\n\nTraining\nAll operations personnel of PCF are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia and chlorine processes, as well as procedures to safely operate the processes.  Operations personnel receive refresher training at least every three years.\n\nContractors\nThe PCF uses contractors to supplement its workforce for certain maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia or chlorine process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are pre-qualified before performing work, aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they encounter during their work.  The PCF also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe PCF conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release preventio"

The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia and chlorine processes and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.  \n\nHot Work Permits\nPCF has a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process safety.  The hot work permit program is designed to control heat and spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the process area.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nPCF has a system in place to ensure safety concerns associated with changes to the ammonia and chlorine processes are reviewed and addressed prior to the change.  Changes meeting PSM/RMP criteria are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, as well as to verify that existing safeguards and controls have not been compromised by the change.  The system requires that process safety information and operating procedures are updated and that operations and maintenance personnel are trained before the change is implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPCF will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the release of ammonia or chlorine.  The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be"

The facility will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\n\nAdditional Safety Systems\nPCF has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia or chlorine, as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases.  These systems include:\n*  Redundant instrumentation to monitor critical process parameters\n*  Redundant critical equipment\n*  Automated shutdown systems\n*  Pressure relief valves\n*  Toxic gas sensors\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents at the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nPCF maintains a written emergency action program.  The program addresses important aspects of emergency action as required by OSHA.  PCF is a defensive responder to release emergencies.  Dow Chemical emergency responders are notified to respond to major releases.  The emergency action program is coordinated with Dow Chemical and the Iberville Parrish Office of Emergency Planning.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPCF continually reviews opportunities to improve the safety of its process.  No specific improvements are planned, at this time, however, PCF employees attend regular operations and maintenance training sessions."
