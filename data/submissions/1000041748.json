      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Hopkins Cold Storage facility utilizes the services of a refrigeration contractor to maintain the ammonia refrigeration system.  The refrigeration contractor checks the system on a regular basis to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.  Brent LaSalle is a point contact in the event of an emergency at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed, the refrigeration contractor is notified and any personnel onsite will evacuate to the designated assembly area.  The refrigeration contractor and local responding agencies are called to assist with the ammonia leak as necessary.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at 325 Blake Road North in Hopkins, Minnesota was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the International Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 20,300 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage, and brine chilling. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators are located in their "

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented at the Hopkins Cold Storage facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a new/modified process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that the Minnehaha Water District (MWD) contractors and tenants perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors and tenants understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are insta"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room and in refrigerated spaces which will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection.  The refrigeration contractor is notified in the event that an ammonia sensor is triggered.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Hopkins Cold Storage facility has an Emergency Action Plan in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nThe Hopkins Cold Storage facility is non-responding, and the facility has coordinated emergency response efforts with the fire department. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable releases of ammonia over the past five years (April 2009 to April 2014) that exceeded the reportable quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis Revalidation study (performed on April 15-16, 2014), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Hopkins Cold Storage facility located at 325 Blake Road North in Hopkins, Minnesota. The facility is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual "
