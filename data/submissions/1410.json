IS AN AGRICULTURAL RETAIL BUSINESS WHICH PRIMARILY SPECILIZES IN GRAIN STORAGE AND THE SALE OF FERTILIZER FOR AREA CROP PRODUCERS.\n\nTHE PLANT CONSIST OF TWO TANKS.  ONE 26,000 AND ONE 11,000 GALLON TANKS WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 162,000 POUNDS.  THE FACILITY IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN WHICH THEY INSPECT THE PLANT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.  OUR COMPANY ALWAYS RESPONDS TO THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE FACILITIES.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 114,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 2.32  MILES WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 275 AREA RESIDENTS.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE PLANT ARE TRAINED IN SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES.  EMPLOYEES ALWAYS USE  GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS PRESENT DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.   OUR SAFETY TRAINING IS IMPORTANT TO THIS COMPANY BUT AN ACCIDENT OCCURED IN 1998.  WE HAD AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE AND APPROXIMATELY 23,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA WAS RELEASED.  ONE PERSON HAD TO BE EVACUATED FROM THEIR HOME.  THE ONLY PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS TO TREES AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT $3140.00\n\nTHE EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLANS ARE SHARED AND DISCUSSED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY WILL ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
