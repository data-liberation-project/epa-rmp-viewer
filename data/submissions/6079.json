      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted by General Chemical Corporation's Newark Works in compliance with the requirements of section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and was prepared in accordance with tanked States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations contained in 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention program requires the owner of a stationary source having listed substances present in quantities greater than the corresponding threshold quantities to develop and implement a risk management program. The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for 3 different programs of compliance dependent upon the eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical releases as identified in the hazard assessment.  For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.  \n\nAt General Chemical's Newark Works, two listed chemicals are managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria.  These chemicals are Oleum and Nitric Acid. No chemicals are managed on-site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. As identified in this plan, Newark Works is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for the management of Oleum and Nitric Acid.\n\nThis RMP describes Newark Work's risk management program which includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response program. The hazard assessment includes one worst case release scenario and two alternative case release scenarios. The hazard asses"

Our program provides the planning and training necessary to effectively protect workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Essex County Office of Emergency Management (OEM).  Newark Works, the OEM and the local fire departments have coordinated communication to notify the public quickly, if necessary, as well as facilitate quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic committee meetings, Newark Works conducts periodic emergency response drills that involve emergency response organizations.\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nGeneral Chemical's Newark Works facility performs periodic process hazard analysis to evaluate and to strive continuously to improve health, safety and environmental performance as technical developments, scientific understanding, consumer and community needs, and regulatory requirements evolve and change, some of which result in process modifications. The Newark Works facility has been in the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program since 1986.  As a result, the plant has undergone numerous hazard analysis reviews for the processes subject to this program . We have successfully implemented the recommendations identified during these reviews.  The plant continues to operate using the release prevention program implemented at the site as identified above.  Newark Works is currently implementing the rigorous QS-9002 and continues to optimize plant equipment through the use of a preventive/predictive maintenance program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.0\tCertification\n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inqui"

However, if a release does occur, Newark Works has prepared employees in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a release.\n\n2.0\tDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nGeneral Chemical's Newark Works produces Oleum and Sulfuric Acid for use in local and national markets. These chemicals are used in many applications including water treatment, papermaking, detergents, batteries, nylon and computer chips.  Oleum is transferred off-site via tank truck and tank car. Nitric Acid is used as a raw material in the mixed acid process.\n \nTwo production processes at Newark Works use one or more of the regulated chemicals identified above.  The processes, and associated regulated chemicals, are outlined below:\n\nProcess:  Oleum Production\nRegulated Chemical : Oleum\nUse:  Product\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) :  5,000,000\n\nProcess:  Oleum Production\nRegulated Chemical : Sulfur Trioxide\nUse:  Intermediate product\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) :  620\n\nProcess:  Mixed acids \nRegulated Chemical : Nitric Acid\nUse:  Raw Material\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) :  125,000\n\nProcess:  Sulfuric acid production\nRegulated Chemical : Sulfur Trioxide\nUse:  Intermediate product\nQuantity stored per process (lbs.) :  620\n\n\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\n\nUSEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions require that General Chemical provide information about the worst case release scenario and alternative case release scenarios for Oleum and Nitric acid handled at its Newark Works.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n3.1\tWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by the USEPA is a hypothetical accident for one of the chemicals at a site.  It assumes that all safety systems in the facility simultaneously fail and that the entire contents of the largest tank holding it at a site"

      "SummaryText": "is released in a very short time. A  USEPA-designated table defines the distance the material will travel until it disperses so much that it is no longer hazardous.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario at General Chemical's Newark Works assumes that a storage tank containing Oleum fails. The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems simultaneously fail, except for secondary containment currently installed around the Oleum storage tanks, and the contents are released in 10 minutes.  The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 11 miles before it reaches a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n3.2\tAlternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative case release scenario is a more credible hypothetical, site-specific chemical release. It takes into account safety and release prevention systems and procedures used at the plant to control releases. It is more realistic than the worst case release scenario; is calculated using USEPA-designated table; and, is used to plan a facility's emergency response to accidents. \n\n3.2.1\tThe alternative case release scenario for Oleum at Newark Works assumes Oleum would be lost due to failure of a loading hose during the transfer process.  It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release. .  The  USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 0.47 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration.\n\n3.2.2\tThe alternative case release scenario for Nitric Acid at Newark Works assumes Nitric Acid would be lost due to failure of an unloading hose during the transfer process.  It takes into account plant safety systems designed to limit a release.  The  USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 0.30 miles before reaching a non-hazardous concentration\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program des"
