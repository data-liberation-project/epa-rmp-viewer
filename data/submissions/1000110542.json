It was determined that the RMP regulations applied since the facility has received an RMP regulated Toxic Chemical since August 19, 1996 in quantities that exceeded the threshold level. The facility receives, blends, and manages hazardous waste derived fuels (HWDF) which are used to replace fossil fuel consumption in the manufacture of Portland cement at other facilities. The facility has decided to prepare and submit a RMP Plan to maintain future operational flexibility.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nGeocycle is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Artesia facility is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe Toxic Chemicals, vinyl acetate monomer and allyl alcohol, were selected to be addressed in the RMP Plan preparation based on an applicability determination. The process involved at the facility includes handling, storage and blending in tanks and transfers to and from containers such as tank trucks and rail cars. The facility is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and thus is subject to Prevention Program Level 3 as a result of the co-located Holcim cement plant's quarry operations being terminated and the site no longer being subject to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations.
