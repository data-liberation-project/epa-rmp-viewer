      "SummaryText": "City Of Fort Myers ? Central Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\nUpdated January 4, 2005\n\n\nThe City Of Fort Myers Wastewater Treatment Division has developed and maintains a Risk Management Program for control of catastrophic releases of extremely hazardous substances at its Central Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility in Fort Myers, Florida. This program continues the Division?s commitment to the protection of its employees and surrounding community and to the control of the potential for such a release.\n\nThe City of Fort Myers Central Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility is located at 1501 Raleigh Street in Fort Myers, Florida. The facility is a five stage Bardenpho process designed to treat 11.0 million gallons per day of domestic wastewater. The facility is a regional facility that treats sewage generated in the Central, East, and Downtown Fort Myers areas. The facility also treats sewage for much of the eastern portion of Lee County. Once treated for conventional pollutants and nutrients, the effluent either flows to the Caloosahatchee River or is routed through the Reclaimed Water Production Facility for further treatment to reclaimed water standards. Both the effluent discharged to the river and the water treated to reclaimed water status are currently disinfected using Chlorine gas mixed with carrier water. The water being discharged to the river is also dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide gas injected just prior to discharge.\n\nUSEPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR 68) require the development and maintenance of a formal Risk Management Program (RMP) for a process that involves the storage and use of more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine and/or 5,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. In addition, OSHA?s Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119, as cited by section 0101 of the Florida Department of Labor Title 7F), requires a Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The OSHA standard applies to any"

      "SummaryText": " process that involves more than 1,500 pounds of chlorine and/or more than 1,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. These regulations apply to the Central Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility due to the storage and use of several tons of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas for disinfection and dechlorination of treated wastewater effluent. Construction is currently underway to eliminate the use of both hazardous chemicals by converting to \n\nthe use of sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and sodium bisulfite for dechlorination. This project is scheduled for completion during calendar year 2005 after which the City of Fort Myers will submit for deregistration of the RMP as it will no longer be required.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Division has a very comprehensive training program consisting of regularly scheduled training sessions with all of the plant personnel which includes training sessions presented by City staff as well as experts from outside the organization. This training combined with an aggressive preventative and corrective maintenance program have resulted in no reported accidents or chemical releases regulated under the Accidental Release Program for the past five (5) years.\n\nThe RMP includes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). Implementation of the EAP includes ongoing training and prevention measures to effectively minimize the impact of an incident on personnel, the public, or the environment. The plan includes elements such as Emergency evacuation procedures, preparedness procedures for catastrophic events, procedures to account for employees and visitors during an evacuation, first aid duties to be performed by trained personnel, procedures for notifying the City?s emergency responders, contact information for facility personnel, descriptions of alarm systems, training, fire prevention, pre-emergency coordination activities with the emergency response team, and post emergency reporting requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that construction is currently underway "
