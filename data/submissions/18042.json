The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to General Mills employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nGeneral Mills' management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nGeneral Mills, Vallejo, California, facility utilize flourmills to produce flour. The raw materials used in the processes are wheat and chlorine gas. Support operations include a chlorine system, a quality assurance/control laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP. The chemical is chlorine and is used to bleach or age the flour.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nChlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a chlorine release included a release of all the contents of one of the 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines). This release translates to a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes or 200 pounds/min. Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are:  the chlorine is a liquefied gas; the cylinder is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind sp"

The results of the worst-case assessment for chlorine show that the plume must travel 5.4 miles before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 3.0 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the chlorine system is a release resulting from damage or rupture of the chlorine vapor line (pigtail) from the ton cylinder to the chlorine manifold. The pigtail has an inside diameter of 3/8 inch. The operating pressure of the cylinder is 150 psig. The alternative-release rate was derived from the following equation, which is based on the hole size, tank pressure, and the properties of chlorine.\n\n    \n1\n        where:        QR =    Release rate (pounds per minute)\n                HA =    Hole or puncture area = p/4 d2 = p/4 (3/8 in)2 = 0.11 in2\n                Pt =    Tank pressure (pounds per square inch - absolute (psia)) =         14.7 psi + 150 psig = 164.7 psia (absolute)\n                Tt =    Tank temperature (K) = 700F x 4.2 K/0F = 294 K\n                GF =    Gas Factor, incorporating discharge coefficient, ratio of         specific heats, molecular weight, and conversion factors =         29 (EPA guidance document Appendix B, Exhibit B-1).\n\n        Therefore:\n    \n        QR = 30.5 pounds per minute\n\n        This equation gives an estimate of the release rate.\n\nFrom Reference Table 17, Dense Gas Distances to Toxic Endpoint - 60 Minute Release, Urban Conditions, D Stability, Wind Speed 3.0 Meters per Second the distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l is 0.54 miles.\n\nNo active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place. The meteorological data used for this alternative-release scenario was a wind speed of 3 meter/sec, an atmospheric stability classification of D (neutral stability), and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Vallejo facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intende"
