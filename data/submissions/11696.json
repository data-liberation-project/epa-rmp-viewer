      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at CertainTeed, Chowchilla Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacture of wool fiberglass insulation.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include propane and ammonia (aqueous).  Propane is used for fuel.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used as an ingredient in our manufacturing process.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Propane at our facility is 76,500 lb. while Ammonia (aqueous) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 16,452 lb..\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nPropane storage qualifies as a program level 1 process.  In the worst case scenario for this process 76500 lb. of Propane is released.  The release quantity has been limited to 50% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.34 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressu"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCertainTeed, Chowchilla Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of one year.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on May 5, 1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, CertainTeed, Chowchilla Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCertainTeed, Chowchilla Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCertainTeed, Chowchilla Plant carries out highly"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at CertainTeed, Chowchilla Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on May 5, 1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at CertainTeed, Chowchilla Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCertainTeed, Chowchilla Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
