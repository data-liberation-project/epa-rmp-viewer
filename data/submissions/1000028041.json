This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Brownsville Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities are treating and disinfecting wastewater and discharging to surface water. We have two regulated substances present at our facility: chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Chlorine is used for the disinfection of water; sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 12,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of sulfur dioxide is 16,000 pounds.  To evaluate the worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario analyses, we used the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance and EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our sationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: The Robindale Wastewater Plant maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associates with all processes.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered process (i.e., chlorination), the Robindale Wastewater Treatment"
