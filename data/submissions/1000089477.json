The worst-case release scenario is the failure of a storage tank when filled to the greatest amount, which would release 190,000 pounds of aqua ammonia. The alternative release scenario, based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident), is a release from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe with an increased wind speed and D stability modelling parameters."

The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered process took place on August 27, 2020.\r\n\r\nHAZARD REVIEW:  A hazard review of the ammonia process is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the process. The most recent update of the hazard review for the aqua ammonia process handling and storage was conducted on July 30, 2020. Results indicate that no high-risk hazards were identified through the hazard review updates.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered process and are reviewed and revised as needed. The operating procedures were last revised on August 27, 2020. \r\n\r\nTRAINING:  The Pleasant Grove Facility staff, as well as Grow West corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The training program was last reviewed on October 6, 2019. The current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n  1. Initial employee training.\r\n  2. Periodic refresher training.\r\n  3. Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification.\r\n  4. Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training.\r\n  5. Training records for each employee.\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventive maintenance, recordkeeping, and training. The latest equipment inspections were conducted in May 2020 and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on August 27, 2020.\r\n\r\nRMP CHANGE MANAGEMENT:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues"

The procedures were last reviewed verified on August 26, 2020.\r\n\r\nPRE START-UP REVIEW: The pre-startup review (PSR) applies to additions or modifications to the Aqua Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected process are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre-startup review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the RMPCM review. Additionally, a pre-startup review is performed in conjunction with the RMPCM review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures. The PSR procedures were last reviewed or verified on August 26, 2020.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings.
