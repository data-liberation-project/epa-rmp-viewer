SCT carries a written emergency preparedness and response action plan to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release of hazardous materials. \n\nAppropriate procedures are in place to notify emergency responders such as the Local Fire Department or the Whitfield County LEPC. The Whitfield County Emergency Management Agency Plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWhile there are currently no major planned changes to improve safety, SCT continuously improves the safety of the processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and safety suggestions from the employees."

Actions required as result of the audits are undertaken in safe and prompt manner.\n\n\u2022\tIncident Investigation: SCT promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\u2003\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nEpichlorohydrin storage tank is located in a containment dike to contain any spills and prevent any vehicles or forklifts collisions. A nitrogen blanket is used for the storage tank to ensure the tank contents remain at less than 8 percent oxygen. The storage tank will be equipped with level measurement, alarms and shutdown of unloading pumps to avoid overfilling.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of all covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nSCT\u2019s emergency response plan includes immediately evacuating facility of personnel and calling the fire department and trained and certifies emergency responders.
