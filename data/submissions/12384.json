Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nUCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. is a subsidiary plant of UCAR Emulsion Systems, with headquarters in Cary, NC.  UCAR Emulsion Systems is a division of the Union Carbide Corporation, one of the worlds leading manufacturers of basic and specialty chemicals.  Since its inception in 1977, UCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. has been dedicated to the manufacture of emulsion polymers for use throughout the paint, adhesives and architectural coatings industry.  The site covers a total area of 4.3 acres located in lot 38, on B street of Luchetti Industrial Park, in the city of Bayamon, Puerto Rico.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as UCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc., has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  UCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. has the following RMP-regulated toxic substance at levels above threshold quantities: \n\n7 Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Acetic acid ethenyl ester)\n\nUCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. has no RMP-regulated flammable substances in amounts exceeding the specified threshold limits.\n\n3."

      "SummaryText": " Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs Risk Management Planning (RMP) rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) involving one of the toxic chemicals identified in our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\n\nA)     Regulated Toxic Chemicals \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM):  Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) is stored in a 10,000 gallon storage tank located towards the east end of the facility.  The  scenario assumes the total collapse of this storage tank, releasing 78,200 pounds of VAM as a liquid to the spill containment basin.  Written operating procedures and a high-level interlock shutdown system limit the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 95 percent in volume (74,290 pounds). According to EPAs Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following passive mitigation measure was used in this analysis:\n\n7- Secondary Containment:  The tank is located inside a concrete dike sufficiently impervious to contain and prevent permeation of any liquid leaks from the tank. \n\nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n\n7- Tank Construction:  The tank is constructed of material that is not attacked by the stored chemical (stainless steel) according to recognized industry codes and standards for containment and overall safety.\n\n7- High Level Interlock Shutdown System:  An high level alarm activ"

Also, an emergency interlock shutdown system is in place in case the 95% volume level of the tank is exceeded.  This system is designed to shut down the pumps associated with the tank, as well as close valves to the tank, stopping any material transfer being made to the tank.\n\n  Pressure/Vacuum Relief Valves:  The VAM storage tank is equipped with two pressure/vacuum relief valves which are intended to prevent the collapse of the tank due to an overpressure or a vacuum condition.\n\n  Pressure Equalizing Line & Detector:  Vapors generated during the VAM tank truck unloading operation are balanced between the storage tank and the tank truck such that the pressure in both systems are the same throughout the operation.  Also there is a sensor placed in the equalizing line which triggers an alarm whenever a vacuum condition is detected by it.\n\n7 Surveillance:  Operators continuously monitor the monomer transfer process as well as the perimeter of the facility for visual leaks or for monomer smell, since VAM has a low odor threshold (can be easily detected or noticed).\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM):  This scenario assumes a drain valve is open on the transfer pump moving VAM to a process preparation/feed vessel.  The 1\" drain valve releases 8,650 pounds. of VAM over 462 minutes into a containment basin.  According to the OCA Guidance Tables provided by the EPA, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following passive mitigation measure was used in this analysis\n\n7- Secondary Containment: The tank is located inside a concrete dike sufficiently impervious to contain and prevent permeation of any liquid leaks from the tank. \n\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects, should they occur, include:\n\n7 Surveillance: Operators moni"
