The RM plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia at Portion Pac. The facility Risk Management Plan provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the Stratas Foods design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with the requirements.  In most instances, Stratas Foods has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  \n\n\n\n1.1.     Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\n\n\nStratas Foods is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.

This facilities aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials whereever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n\n\n1.1.4.     Stratas Foods has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established regarding the ammonia process process.  It is the responsibility of designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n\n\n1.1.5.     The first duty of Stratas Foods employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.

Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\n1.3.1.     As required by EPA guidelines, the worst case and alternate-case release scenarios were caclulated for the facility. ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) modeling software, combined with Landview V mapping programs and the 2000 Census Bureau records were used for the scenario predictions. The releae scenario data is maintained on file at the Portion Pac facility.  \n\n\n\n1.4.     Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\n1.4.1.     Stratas Foods is equipped with an emergency warning system.  Alarms are placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n\n\n1.4.2.     Plant personnel have received emergency response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 and other various rules and regulations. \n\n\n\n1.4.3.
