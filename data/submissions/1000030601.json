      "SummaryText": "The overall emergency procedure program for the Iowa City Terminal is coordinated with the Johnson County Emergency Management (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Iowa City Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Iowa City Terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.  \r\n  \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Iowa City Terminal.  \r\n\r\n* Enterprise is currently in the process of reviewing and revising the entire safety management / accident prevention program to ensure that the program can be fully administered across the diverse nature of the facilities owned or operated by the company."

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\r\n\r\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysi"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Iowa City Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.

The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal located in Johnson County, Iowa is owned by Enterprise Terminals and Storage LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage, loading and redelivery of flammable hydrocarbon natural gas liquids.  The facility receives, via attached pipelines, a mixed ethane / propane and pure propane products for storage in underground DOT regulated cavern storage.  The facility also has three above ground propane storage tanks that serve as bulk storage for the propane terminal operations.    Propane is odorized with ethyl mercaptan and delivered to tanker trucks at the Iowa City Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa City Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on facility knowledge.  Propane and the ethane/propane mix, consisting of trace methane, ethane, and propane, are the only listed flammable substance which are present above the threshold quantities at the Iowa City Terminal.
