We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously.  The investments Hatfield has made in environmental stewardship result in a cleaner environment and the conservation of our precious resources.  Hatfield is committed to constant reinvestment into its facility to keep its equipment and processes modern and efficient, resulting in the highest level of equipment integrity and safety for our employees and the surrounding communities.\n\nWith the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP), Hatfield continues to show its commitment to operate the facility and all its processes in a safe, environmentally responsible manner. Emergency response planning and an accidental release prevention program are in place to ensure a safe working environment and with it, protection of the public and the environment outside the property lines.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHatfield Quality Meats is a family owned and operated company that has been in business since 1895.  Hatfield is a manufacturer and supplier of quality fresh and manufactured pork products for retail and foodservice industries.  The operations performed at the plant include: slaughtering, cutting, processing manufacturing, and rendering.  The facility occupies approximately 887,927 square feet and is situated on approximately 75 acres of land.\n\nThe facility has approximately 91,849 pounds of ammonia onsite in its refrigeration systems.  This Risk Management Plan was developed for these ammonia refrigeration systems. Five compressor rooms containing 12 main ammonia storage vessels provide refrigeration for the entire facility.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.

      "SummaryText": "is facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the high-temperature recirculator (V-2), in compressor room 5, as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel with 13,708 pounds of ammonia and causing the released quantity to be equal to the total vessel volume with no piping volume included. The Distance to Toxic Endpoint of 1.5  miles creates a Circle of Concern that includes a residential population of 11,697 people.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve. The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve  (101.6 lbs per min.) with a release-duration of 30 minutes. The Distance to Toxic Endpoint of 0.1 miles creates a Circle of Concern that includes a residential population of 0 people.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia system at Hatfield is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Rule (PSM Rule).  The management system developed based on this regulation together with elements of the Risk Management Program results in a comprehensive prevention program.  Hatfield is committed to maintaining this system. \n\nThe elements of the prevention program include: an employee training program, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for numerous operations, a maintenance program, a system to manage changes at the plant to ensure that safety and "

It is the policy of the facility management to implement the requirements of this ER Plan by managing and operating the facility in accordance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations and general good operating practices.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a fire or an accidental hazardous material release.  The ER Plan was developed to ensure fast and efficient response in case of an emergency situation.\n\nThe ER Plan identifies the emergency response organization, the procedures for notification and  evacuation, and emergency preparedness and planning.\n\nHatfield has assigned roles for its emergency response coordinator, alternate emergency response coordinators, and emergency response team.  These emergency coordinator and alternates are responsible for emergency actions as well as coordination with state and local agencies on a 24-hour basis.  The emergency coordinator functions as the leader of the emergency response team, initiates plant evacuation if needed, notifies the appropriate governmental agencies and offsite responders, and is responsible for documenting and reporting after the emergency.  The emergency response team provides additional support.\n\nIn addition, the ER Plan details the responsibility of the first aid team, the emergency procedures, and the evacuation procedures.  \n\nHatfield has coordinated services with a number of government and community agencies which would respond to an emergency, such as the state and local police or fire departments, the ambulance squad, state and county emergency response off"

Part of this commitment is maintaining and operating the system in accordance with the principles and requirements of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP plans.  Changes to improve safety will be implemented as directed by these two plans and standards presented by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration."
