The facility has a program for emergency notification of municipal government in the event of an accidental release which threatens to go off-site.\n\nOne material (ammonia), which is listed in the RMP program, is handled at a volume in excess of the threshhold amount; the ammonia is handled only in the form of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere is a single process on the facility that handles the anhydrous ammonia:\n\n        Anhydrous Ammonia load-out in a 9,800 gallon tank (42,483 pounds).\n\nProgram 2 is the default program level for all facilities.  This facility does not manufacture fertilizers.  It purchases the agricultural chemicals wholesale and sells them retail directly to farmers, who use the products for crop production.  As such, it is not an OSHA PSM facility, nor does it have an NAICS code which requires Program 3.  The facility has public receptors within the worst-case zone and therefore does not qualify as a Program 1.  Program 2 is therefore selected for this facility.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the release of the entire 42,483 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the 9,800 gallon DOT tank trailer, which has an off-site impact with a toxic endpoint of 0.93 miles.  The alternative scenario is a leak from the 3-inch liquid pipe on the tank trailer, which has an off-site impact with a toxic endpoint of 0.83 miles.  The toxic endpoints are calculated with the DEGADIS model.  No active or pasive mitigation measures are assumed.\n\nThe prevention program emphasizes procedural and managerial steps which enhance maintenance and training.  There have been no accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program includes:\n\n       1.  A facility-specific"
