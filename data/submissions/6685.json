THE MAXIMUM  AMOUNT  RELEASED  WOULD BE 140,000\nPOUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14MG/L FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS 2.50 MILES.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDOINT OF .14MG/L FOR THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS .20 MILE. THIS RELEASE HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING BEYOND THE FACILITY BOUNDARY. \nTHIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL APPLIC-\nABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.
