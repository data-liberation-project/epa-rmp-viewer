The refrigeration system is designed and operated according to good engineering and safe work practices.\n\nDFA-Monett has established an Emergency Response Program that addresses the safety of our employees in the event of a release. DFA-Monett has also coordinated with the Monett Fire Department and the Barry/Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning District (LEPD). \nDFA-Monett has a good safety record in preventing and minimizing releases of ammonia.\n\nFacility Information\nThe DFA-Monett facility processes milk to produce dairy related products for use as ingredients in numerous food products. DFA has on site an ammonia refrigeration system used to maintain product freshness, to meet processing requirements, and to provide cooling for employee comfort. DFA-Monett is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68 because the refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000-pound threshold for ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nDFA-Monett has an accidental release prevention program to prevent and minimize the effects of a spill or release of ammonia.
