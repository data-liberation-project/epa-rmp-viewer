The facility is known as Cloverleaf of Fairfield, Ohio.Cloverleaf of Fairfield  houses an engine room, which contains 7 compessors ranging in size from 100-horse power to 250-horse power. This engine room also contains all of the ammonia holding vessels, except for the receiver that is located outside of the building structure.\n\n The system comprises of various refrigeration components including compressors, evaporators, vessels, pumps and condensers. The ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are high and low pressure automated shutdown systems and high level automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur. Equipment operating parameters are monitored throughout the day and logged for comparison to indicate potential problems.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at this facility within the last five years.\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to evacuate the facility and allow the local Fire Departments Hazmat Team to intervene and bring the situation under control.  Cloverleaf is in the process of upgrading their emergency response to a higher level of partcipation and plans to have training and procedures in place before the year 2001.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the largest  storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 9,600  pounds of ammonia. This vessel normally contains a maximum 2,800 pounds of ammonia but if the makeup valve stuck open it could contain 9,600  pounds of ammonia before the high-level system shutdown would occur.\n\nAlternate-Scenario. - The scenario chosen for the alternate scenerio is one of a pipe being broken clear through and to have a wide-open, undeformed, open end.  The pipe size i"
