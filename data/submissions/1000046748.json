      "SummaryText": "Rader Farms, Inc is a berry processing, freezing and storage facility located in rural Whatcom County, outside the Town of Lynden in Washington state.  The plant uses approximately 13,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia in their refrigeration system.  The system consists of one engine room containing all but one high pressure receiver, which is located outside the building.  \n\n\n\nThe largest vessel in the system can hold 14,542 lbs of ammonia.  Following standard operating procedures this vessel will never be filled to over 80% full.  The ammonia is continually circulated throughout a closed system and never held in any one vessel.\n\n\n\nEach pressure vessel in the mechanical refrigeration process has a safety relief valve attached.  The outlet is piped to an area away from any personnel (the roof).  All vessels are fitted with three-way shut off valves and dual SRVs.  SRVs are inspected and documented every six months, and replaced every five years.  The chances for a leak occurring are reduced because of the following safety systems:\n\n  Suction trap hi-level float\n\n  High discharge pressure shut down\n\n  Low suction pressure shut down\n\n  High discharge temperature shut down\n\n  Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n  High amperes shut down\n\n  Computer auto timer to prevent short cycling\n\n  Oil filters plugged shut down\n\n  250 psi relief valves on high pressure side\n\n  150 psi relief valves on low pressure side\n\n\n\nAll employees who are involved with ammonia, are trained to understand the safety and health hazards of this refrigerant and the refrigeration system.  Each employee is properly trained in:  Understanding MSDSs; routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation; emergency and normal refrigeration safety procedures; and their role in the emergency response plan.  Management has also established a procedure to ensure that contractor and maintenance personnel are trained.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive maintenance and mechanical integrity program covering th"

The mechanical integrity program includes planned maintenance and quality assurance activities to be performed, inspection and testing procedures, training procedures and documentation instructions.\n\n\n\nStandard operating procedures have been written and made available to all employees in the refrigeration department.  The development and use of SOPs are an integral part of Rader Farms' ability to maintain the quality control and quality assurance processes and ensure compliance with governmental regulations.\n\n\n\nEmployees are trained to follow an emergency response plan that moves all employees to an assembly area away from the facility in case of a release of ammonia.  The employees are not trained to respond to releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Whatcom County Fire Department has a hazmat team that will respond and take control of the situation should a release occur.  Rader Farms has provided the fire department with a copy of their emergency response plan and walk through the plant annually.\n\n\n\n"
