      "SummaryText": "Cascade Columbia Distribution (CCD) is a wholesale distributor of industrial chemicals. CCD is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors and as such is subject the Responsible Distribution Program. This program requires a safety management system and requires safety commitments beyond those required by OSHA, EPA and DOT. CCD senior management is committed to handling all industrial chemicals responsibly and safely.\n\nCCD stores and processes 70% Hydrofluoric Acid (HF70%), which is the only chemical subject to the RMP standard on site. The accidental release prevention program utilized at CCD consists of elements required by the EPA Risk Management Plan, Level 2 program. HF70% is brought into the facility in 500 lb (55 gallons) drums.  Its primary use is to make a more dilute form of HF which is subsequently sold in commerce.\n\nWithin the next five years, it is planned to bring HF70% into the facility by bulk tank truck (40,000 lbs, or 4000 gallons). The bulk tank truck load of HF70% will be immediately diluted to make a less hazardous product, so the 4000 gallons on site is very temporary.  All production and storage areas where HF70% is or will be handled and stored are contained by concrete diking designed to contain more than the maximum amount of product that could be spilled. \n\nCCD\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response program meets the regulatory requirements of the standard, and addresses such things as spill control, worker personal protection, and coordination with public emergency responders. CCD works closely with the local response agencies and has hosted drills for spill response training. Details regarding the Offsite Consequence Analyses are included in this plan.  CCD has had no incidents involving HF 70% in the last 5 years.  CCD takes great pride in its safety, environmental and risk handling systems.  These systems have proven effective in the past and are continually improved upon as new technology and information becomes available."
