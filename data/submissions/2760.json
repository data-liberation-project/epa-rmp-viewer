OUR FARMER OWNER'S MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO PLAND AND PREVENT ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  tHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THIS FACILITY IS THE SORTAGE AND TRANSFER OF ANHYFROUS AMMONIA TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANATITY STORED IS 184,000 LBS .  THE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENERIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 184,000 LBS., WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AND COMPANY POLICY. THE DISTANCE TO END POINT IN A WORSE CASE SCENERIO IS 2.5 MILES FROM OUR NH3 PLANT.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON OUR HISTORY AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO END POINT IN OUR SITUATION IS .83 MILES.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAS CAUSEDINJURY OR DEATH OR OFF SITE DEATHS, INJURIES, OR EVACUATION, NOR HAVE WE HAD A RELEASE THAT HAS REQUIRED SHELTERING IN PLACE OR OTHER EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.  THE EMERGENCY PLAN WE HAVE DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR SUPPLIERS AND OTHER INDUSTRY EXPERTS IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE REISKS TO EMPLOYEES, THE PUBLIC, AS WELL AS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.  WE ARE PROUD OF THE EXCELLANT SAFETY PROGRAM WE HAVE DEVELOPED AS WELL AS OUR SAFETY RECORD.  IT IS OUR DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR EFFORTS AND DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES AND METHODS TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND PATRONS IN A SAFE MANNER."
