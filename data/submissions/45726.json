This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Buffalo County and Sherman County LEPCs, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses  Cheese Manufacturing.  The plant is located at 102 Lincoln Avenue, Ravenna, Nebraska.  We have one RMP-regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, at our facility. which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese.  The maximum inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at our facility is approximately 43,851 pounds.\n\n\n3.   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs ass"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"What If/Checklist\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval  (five years or when changes dictate).  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.  All training is documented and validated by employees, on the Leprino Foods Company Training Tracking System.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include; pressure vessels, storage receivers, piping systems relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are correct"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLeprino Foods Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are to be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccuring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLeprino Foods Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized mai"

Leprino Foods Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of regulated substance occur.\n\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History\n\nWe have had one reportable accident since Leprino Foods Company purchased the facility in 1998.  This release was caused by a contractor and handled by our HazMat Team with no effect on the local community.\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Ravenna facility coordinates its emergency response plan with the Buffalo County LEPC and Sherman County LEPC.\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Completion of the PHA recommendations are expected to occur by January 10, 2004."
