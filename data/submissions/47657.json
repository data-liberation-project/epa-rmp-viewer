      "SummaryText": "Facility and Regulated Materials\nThe Airgas National Welders facility located in Goldsboro, NC is primarily an acetylene production plant.  Acetylene gas is manufactured at the facility.  Also, various industrial gases are repackaged at the facility by the transfill of cryogenic gases from bulk tanks into compressed gas cylinders.  Some gases, are simply received in cylinders, stored on site, and shipped to customers.  The facility has determined that the quantity of acetylene may reach the regulatory threshold under RMP.  The facility also covers this material under its Process Safety Management (PSM) program. \n\nAirgas National Welders conducts its operations to prevent possible releases or harm to its products, employees and to the surrounding area and residents.  Airgas National Welders implements many Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the acetylene process and the safe handling of compressed gas cylinders to prevent any accidental release.  Along with written standard operating procedures, several administrative controls are used.  These include, operator training, emergency procedures, qualification of operators, and inventory control.  \n\nThe company uses a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as the foundation of the chemical prevention program.  The PHA systematically examines the equipment, systems and procedures for handling regulated materials in order to identify the hazards that exist and how to control them.  The PHA included a team review of the process using the what-if/checklist methodology to identify hazards, review of previous incidents, verification of controls and the consequences of their failure, review of issues related to sitting and human factors and a qualitative evaluation of failures of control.\n\nAcetylene \nAcetylene gas is generated by a process from calcium carbide and water.  The maximum amount of acetylene at the facility is estimated to be 25,000 lbs with no more than 15,000 pounds in a process. The Airgas National Welders facility i"

The EAP is a separate document.  Airgas National Welders maintains a trained hazardous material response team in accordance with the company\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Response Manual.  The Emergency Response Manual and EAP outline the trained personnel, equipment, and actions that are to be taken in case of a release of a hazardous material.  Hazardous material communication training is also conducted to protect the safety of all employees.\n\nIn the event of an acetylene incident, mitigation controls include the Plant Deluge System, the Plant Alarm System, and the employee Evacuation Plan."
