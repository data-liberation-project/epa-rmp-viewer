Our prevention program includes the use of proper epuipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training for all employees that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the Robinson Fire Dept. and the Crawford County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to assure a quick response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to our community and environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anyhdrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored at our facility would be 133,000 pounds stored in two tanks totaling 30,000 gal.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the release of the entire contents of the storage tanks as a gas in 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 133,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design and company policies.  the distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 6.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a two-inch transfer hose, with 1000 pounds released in a 5-minute period.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.30 miles.\n\nEffingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR- 1910.111 regarding proper storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years.\n\nEffingham Equity has a written emergency action plan in accordance with "

There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
