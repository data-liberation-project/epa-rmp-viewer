      "SummaryText": "The Lake Pleasant Water Treatment Plant (WTP) located at 37000 N. New River Road in Peoria, Arizona is a conventional water treatment plant that treats Central Arizona Project (CAP) Waddell canal water to potable use by the City of Phoenix. The WTP contains a covered process subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMP), 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nThe covered process at the WTP is chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5), which is injected into the finished water for disinfection. The chlorine storage and feed system are designed to utilize one-ton chlorine containers that are handled within the Chlorine Building. The chlorine system is designed to provide continuous finished water chlorine residual for disinfection. The facility was constructed under a design, build, operate (DBO) project with Black & Veatch/McCarthy as the design team and American Water Enterprises as the Operator. The WTP facility was commissioned in June 2007. \r\n\r\nThe Operator of the WTP has implemented a Process Safety Management/Risk Management Procedure (PSM/RMP) and an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prevent the accidental release of chlorine and to mitigate the consequences of a release. The program follows the fourteen elements of the PSM standard. The process hazard analysis (PHA) of the covered process was revalidated in June 2016 and the PSM/RMP program was most recently audited in July 2016; both of these activities were led by a qualified third-party PSM consultant.\r\n\r\nThe WTP contains up to 20 tons of chlorine gas at a given time, with 10 tons in use. The chlorine feed system consists of 10, 1-ton containers (tonners) on-line and 10 tonners placed in stand-by (upon change out of the bank of containers that have been depleted). Chlorine containers are stored in an enclosed building that is designed to contain a worst-case chlorine gas release"

      "FacilityID": 1000058918,
      "SummaryText": "; the chlorine building is provided with an emergency scrubber that is designed to treat 10,000 pounds of chlorine gas. The emergency scrubber is automatically activated upon a gas detection within the building, and the emergency scrubber can also be remotely operated. Gas detection systems within the building provide a warning at 1.0 ppm and an alarm at 3.0 ppm. The tonners are equipped with motorized control valves and the chlorine feed system can be remotely shutdown in an emergency from the Operator Control Room or via manual emergency shutdown buttons located outside the chlorine building entrance.\r\n\r\nThe WTP is staffed 24 hours/day by a licensed Water Treatment Operator. The Operator controls the chlorine system from the Operator Control Room located within the Administrative Building. The chlorine building is a secured zone within a secured site, and all access doors to the chlorine building are secured with access controls. A two-person rule applies for entry into the chlorine building and entry into the chlorine building is prohibited at chlorine concentrations above the warning level (1.0 ppm). \r\n\r\nAmerican Water Enterprises has implemented an Emergency Action Pan for the WTP and personnel do not respond to chlorine emergencies at facility beyond remotely activating emergency shutdown controls and the emergency scrubber. Evacuation rally points have been established at the Main (North) and South gates. In the event of a chlorine emergency, the Fire Department will be notified. The facility maintains a B kit for containing major leaks on the tonners for use by the Fire Department Hazmat Unit. \r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable releases since the facility was commissioned, and there are no major changes planned to improve safety aside from program improvement recommendations resulting form the most recent PHA revalidation and compliance audit."
