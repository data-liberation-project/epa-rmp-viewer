The facility processes and stores frozen vegetables.  Seasonal workers are employed in summer and fall months during the harvest/processing season. The plant was built in 1998, and expanded in 2006, and in 2012.\n\n\n\nChemical of Concern\n\nThe facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system to freeze and store vegetables.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe facility implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (WAC 296-67), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has built in safety features including high level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check valves, multiple leak detectors and emergency shutdown devices. Safety relief valves are plumbed to a scrubbing tank. System operation is monitored by a modern computer system 24/7.\n\n\n\nThe system is appropriately designed, maintained, and operators are trained to minimize the risk of releases.  Site security measures "

      "SummaryText": "and surveillance systems are also in place at the facility. Management is committed to maintaining a safe facility.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan per WAC 296-824 to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during a response.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. Evacuation alarms are installed throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to  Improve Safety\n\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety committee meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. The system is modern and upgrades have occurred on a regular basis since construction."
