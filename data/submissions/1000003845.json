A primary aspect of this commitment is the Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant system to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, the Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant established a management system to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n2.0  Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. \n\nProcess Description:"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  \n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a damaged chlorinator.  The results of the Hazard Assessment have been appriately communicated with local emergency response agencies.\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\n\nThe Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant Chlorination Process is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Chlorination Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nThe Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n* specific chemical inventories.\n \nThe Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant ensures that the process safety information is available to all Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant employees, the Local E"

This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlorine and other chemicals used in our process.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\nThe Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes:\n \n* materials of construction,\n* design pressures,\n* temperature ratings,\n* electrical ratings,\n* flow limits,\n* block flow diagrams,\n* consequences of deviation from operating limits,\n* safety systems,\n* applicable design codes and standards,\n* process chemistry, and\n* design basis for relief and ventilation systems.\n\nMany of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to aid in the safe and proper operation of the process.  These documents are used to:\n\n* train employees,\n* perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n* help maintain the equipment.\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Chlorination Process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant performed and will periodically update process hazard analyses"

Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the EHS Committee and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorination Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the EHS Committee for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nMorristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Chlorination Process operat"

Under this program, all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for the Chlorination Process must be evaluated and approved to help ensure the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training related to the change.\n\n4.7  Pre-startup Review\n\nThe Morristown Utilities System Water Treatment Plant performs a safety review of all new or modified processes prior to their being placed into service to ensure that these processes have been prepared to operate safely.
