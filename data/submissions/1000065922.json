TURLOCK PLANT\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (CALARP) AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\n\n\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA REFRIGERATION SYSTEM CHLORINE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Revised August 2017 Rev.3\n\n\n\nSupHerb Farms, Inc. (SupHerb Farms) prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) for its Turlock plant in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2745, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSupHerb prepared the RMP/PSM Program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia and chlorine handling systems and practices at the facility. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, SupHerb Farms has written an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the local fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team. SupHerb will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM Program.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSupHerb"

      "SummaryText": " Farms is located at 300 Dianne Drive, Turlock, California. The area is zoned for industrial use. This facility processes herbs and specialty vegetables by freezing and/or other processing. Fresh  herbs and specialty vegetables are processed through an Instant Quick Freeze (IQF) tunnel. Frozen herbs are packaged for wholesale markets or processed through a paste line. Cold storage is also provided within the warehouse for holding packaged final products. The NAICS Code for the facility is 311411 Frozen Fruit, Juice, and Vegetable Manufacturing.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) is the regulated substance used in the facility's refrigeration system. The refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 19,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling to the cold storage rooms, and processing lines. The cold rooms are used to store finished products ready for shipping.\n\n\n\n\n\nChlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is utilized as a biocide to disinfect the process water in the facility which is used three wash lines. The source of chlorine for the chlorination system during normal operation is a one-ton container. Two one-ton containers may be on site, resulting in a maximum chlorine inventory of 4,000 pounds. At times 150 Lb. bottles are used when the ton cylinders are running low.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the SupHerb Farms facility due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more lik"

These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe CALARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. SupHerb Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system and chlorine wash tank process to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. One safety concern with closed-loop ammonia system or a chlorine cylinder is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The second is a component failure. The SupHerb Farms ammonia and chlorine process has safeties and cutouts that shut down pump components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the ammonia and chlorine processes are equipped with pressure relief valves on pressure vessels and most chlorine cylinders. Additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped. The ammonia pressure relief valves discharge into a diffusion tank of adequate capacity. The chlorine cylinder would release to atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system is, for the most part, under less than atmospheric pressure with only the two one-ton cylinders and vacuum regulators operated at above atmospheric pressure. The vacuum regulators will shut off chlorine flow if vacuum is lost anywhere in the delivery piping.\n\n\n\nOther safety features at the facility include:\n\n?    Ammonia leak detection in the engine room\n\n?    Chlorine release detection in the incoming vegetable wash line area\n\n?    Remote emergency shutdown switch\n\n?    Fire sprinklers indoors throughout the facility\n\n?    Component-specific safety shutdowns\n\n?    Personnel Monitors\n\n?    Monitoring by pe"
