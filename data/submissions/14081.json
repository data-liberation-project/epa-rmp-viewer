Torch Operating Company (Torch) operates the facility for Nuevo.  It is the policy of Nuevo and Torch that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any off-site impacts that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this end, Torch strives to operate is facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. Nuevo and Torch have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at the Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  It is each company's philosophy to implement reasonable mitigation measures to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances. \n  \nCompany emergency response policies are implemented to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and minimizing risk to the public.  This is considered to be of prime importance; therefore, all procedures must be carried out in the appropriate manner.  The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel has the highest priority.  Only then can safely executed rescue and medical activities be considered.  Protection of the environment is another high priority.  Only after life, safety, and environmental concerns are addressed will the focus shift to the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery.\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\nThe Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant is located, approximately 12 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 1.5 miles northeast of Vandenberg Village.  The nearest public road is Harris Grade Road, approximately < miles to the west. "

      "SummaryText": " The facility is relatively remote and bounded by undeveloped private property. \n\nThe Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant is a relatively small industrial operation, occupying approximately 20 acres and consists of one Program 3 process. The facility receives incoming crude oil and gas from an offshore platform (including some gas from onshore fields) and then utilizes several operations to produce natural gas and natural gas liquids for product.  The incoming oil is processed in the oil treating portion of the facility where water and other contaminates are separated from the crude oil before it is shipped via pipeline to a refinery for further processing.  The incoming gas is treated by removing water, hydrogen sulfide, and other heavy hydrocarbon components.  The hydrocarbon liquids which are separated out are sent to pressure vessels for storage before being trucked offsite to distributors.  The natural gas from the process is dry gas which is sold as a product.\n\n1.3  Regulated Substances\n\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane and iso-pentane are present at the facility.  There are no regulated toxic substance present at the facility in excess of the federal threshold quantities.   \n\n1.4 Summary of Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n1.4.1  Worse-Case Release Scenario - Flammable\n\nThe worse-case release for flammables, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is less than the maximum capacity, and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  \n\nThe worse-case release scenario modeled for the Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant is a release of the entir"

The worse-case release scenario identified some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes minimal public receptors and no residential receptors.  \n\n1.4.2  Alternative Release Scenario - Flammable\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables is a release of natural gas liquids which results in a vapor cloud fire.  The alternative release scenario could have some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes no off-site residential receptors.\n\n1.5  Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\nIn addition to being subject to RMP requirements the Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant is subject to Office of Employee Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions) Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program.  \n\nCompliance with PSM's comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes which handle flammable materials.  The objective of the Company's PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, Torch has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety management program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process.  Using this approach, the process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process are all considered in the evaluation.  The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and st"

Process safety management is the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment.  The elements of the company's PSM and accidental release prevention program are summarized below:\n\nProcess Safety Information - This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment essential to the company's PSM program and to a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards, technology and the equipment of the natural gas processing system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable materials.  The PHA provides information that will assist the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable materials.  As part of the company's PSM program a PHA has been conducted for the Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant. \n\nOperating Procedures - As part of the PSM program, all procedures for operating and maintaining the natural gas processing system are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this system.  As needed, changes or updates to the natural gas processing system operating procedures are incorporated under the company's management of change program.\n\nEmployee Training - Personnel performing specific tasks which affect the natural gas processing system must be qualified to perform their assigned tasks.  The company has an established training program that ensures the training and competency of employees whose jobs require them to perform work which affect the natural gas processing system. \n\nMechanical Integrity - Under the PSM program, equipment"

As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.\n\nManagement of Change - Contemplated changes to a process must be evaluated thoroughly to fully assess their impact on employee safety and health and to determine needed changes to operating procedures.  The company has established and implemented procedures to manage changes (except for \"replacements in kind\") to process chemicals, technology equipment and procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the natural gas processing system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - As one of the requirements of PSM, Torch is required to perform a pre-startup safety review for new facilities, and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  Although the processes at the Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant are essentially mature and therefore the start up of new processes are not anticipated, a PHA will be performed prior to start up for new processes which require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold.  For existing processes that have been shutdown for turnaround or modification, company policy ensures that any changes other than \"replacement in kind\" made to the process during shutdown go through the management of change process.    \n\nCompliance Audits - Periodically Torch performs an audit of their PSM program as required by the PSM standard.  An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and information, including statistical information, to verify compliance with the PSM standards.  The "

Accordingly, Torch has an incident investigation program which requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable material.\n \nEmployee Participation Plan - Torch has developed written procedures to include employees in the development, implementation and management of these PSM program elements.\n\nHot Work & Safe Work Practices - Torch has established safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.  These include (but are not limited to): lock-out/tag-out procedures for energy isolation of equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities,  and confined space entry procedures for work performed in confined spaces.\n\nContractor Safety - Torch, in following OSHA's PSM Guidelines, has established a screening process so they hire only contractors who accomplish the desired tasks without compromising safety when working around or in the natural gas processing system.  Torch also has a written Contractor Safety Procedure to ensure that the actions or operating conditions of contract workers do not compromise the safety of employees, the community, or the contract workers themselves.\n\n1.6  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to implementation of the PSM elements, Torch has implemented specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases of regulated (and other) substances at the Lom"

The plan consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances including the possibility of fires or explosions.  The procedures address various aspects of emergency proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, notification of local emergency response agencies, evacuation plans for the Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, and post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment and alarms. \n\nApplication of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans), and the emergency response element of PSM.  The basic concepts of these emergency procedures are to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies.  The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\n1.8 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a requirement of Santa Barbara Count"
