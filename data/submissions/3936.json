The facility uses chlorine to disinfect the plant effluent prior to discharge.  The facility's NPDES permit requires disinfection from May 1 through September 30 each year.  The facility also uses chlorine to destroy undesirable organisms in the biological treatment process (filamentous organism reduction).  The Neenah Menasha Sewerage Commission stores chlorine at the facility year round.  The facility has stored on-site an average of 6000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nHandling of chlorine is limited to: 1) unloading cylinders from the delivery truck and placing the cylinders into the storage area 2) connecting full tanks to the feed system and disconnecting empty tanks.  The facility has worked safely with chlorine for 30 years.  The staff receives both on the job training and classroom training for chlorine handling.  \n\nThe Neenah Menasha Sewerage Commission is committed to the safe handling of chlorine for the protection of the employees, the public and the environment.  Although the Commission is not yet required to comply with OSHA's 1910.119 Process Safety Management, the facility has been in compliance with this safety standard since 2/29/96.  The facility will convert to sodium hypochlorite by the year 2000 thus eliminating the need for chlorine gas.  \n\nManagement System\n\nThe purpose of the management program is to ensure that everyone who plays a part in the RMP understands their roles and that responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.  \n\nRandall R. Much, General Manager has the overall responsibility for development, implementation and integration of the RMP.  Jim Peichl has overall responsibility for the RMP in the absence of Randall R. Much.

This could only occur when the cylinders are being taken off the delivery truck.  Personnel are trained in this procedure and the employees treat chlorine with respect, so it is unlikely that a release of this type would occur.  Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined by the EPA's Guidance Manual as atmospheric stability F (stable atmosphere), wind speed 3.4 mph, and ambient air temperature of 770 F, and 50% humidity.  The scenario requires a ground level release and a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.  The off-s"

In the unlikely event of a chlorine release it is more probable that it would occur inside the storage area.  The building would mitigate the release.  Meteorological conditions for the alternative scenario are defined by the EPA's Guidance Manual as atmospheric stability D, wind speed 6.7 mph, ambient temperature 770 F, and humidity 50%.  The scenario requires a ground level release and a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.  The off-site impact of this release would be 0.58 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Neenah Menasha Sewerage Commission's (NMSC) prevention program follows the guidelines provided in OSHA's 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard.  The NMSC has several controls in place:\nEngineering Controls:\nChlorine is stored in a room separate from other facility processes.  The chlorine room is locked and posted with a \"Danger Chlorine\" and \"Authorized Personnel Only\" sign.  The chlorine room has a leak detection system with an alarm. \nAdministrative Controls:\nThis facility is staffed 24-hours per day.  This facility has written chlorine-handling procedures.  When changing tanks, two employees are required for connecting and disconnecting the tanks.  One operator attaches the connecting valves, while the other operator uses the ammonia bottle to check for leaks.  Operators wear respiratory protection while changing tanks.  Plant safety procedures in place include Lockout/Tagout, Hazard Communication, and Respiratory Protection.  Plant personnel attend annual training sessions for all safety-related issues.  The Mechanical Integrity Program includes regular testing and inspection of the equipment.\nPersonal Protective Equipment:\nIn the event of a chlorine leak the facility is equipped with SCBA, gloves, boots, and rain gear.  This equipment is to be used for small connection leaks or emergency rescue "

Plant personnel will contain the leak if possible by closing the doors of the storage area and turning off the exhaust fan.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases with the chlorine system at the Neenah Menasha Sewerage Commission.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Neenah Menasha Sewerage Commission has an Emergency Action Plan as part of its Safety Manual.  Included in this plan are procedures in the event of a chlorine emergency.    Additionally, the NMSC coordinates an off-site plan for chlorine emergencies with the County LEPC, HAZ MAT, local fire departments and local police departments.  The emergency response plan for a chlorine release is reviewed at least annually by all plant personnel.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility will convert to sodium hypochlorite by the year 2000 thus eliminating the need for chlorine gas.  Until that time the facility will continue to implement the current safety and training program that has to date prevented any release of chlorine gas."
