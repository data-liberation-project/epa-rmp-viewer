The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system to control human environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to our workers as well as the surrounding communities.\n\nIt is Harlan's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations; however, the safe handling of hazardous chemicals is paramount.  We adhere to standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of hazardous chemicals to ensure that we have obtained a reasonable level of risk reduction.  Investigation of inherently safer refrigeration technologies and fail-safe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements occurring at Harlan Bakeries.  Safety depends upon our management, the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent to our refrigeration system, our operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of our employees.\n\nWe believe that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management and this philosophy is evident in our mission statement.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in our organization structure and employee empowerment.\n\nWe have made extensive improvements to safety and health programs like our prevention program (process safety management), emergency preparedness and response, and training.\n\nAdditionally, we believe employee"

      "SummaryText": " involvement is the cornerstone to continued safe operations.  We call it employee ownership and its success is portrayed through lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved efficiencies at the plant.\n\n \nThe Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually tornadoes, heavy snowstorms, or conditions that are reasonably predictable.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of on-site emergencies such as a spill, fire/explosion, or a chemical release.  \n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled\n\nHarlan Bakeries is a domestic producer of processed bakery foods that include baked, partially baked, and frozen raw bagels, muffins and cookie products.  The Harlan Bakeries Avon, Indiana plant site covers approximately 216,768 square feet within the Avon, Indiana city limits.  It is located at 7597 East U.S. Highway 36 in Avon, Indiana, Hendricks County.\n\nThere are approximately 380 employees at the plant site, which are not represented by a union organization. \n\nWe presently handle only one chemical that is considered hazardous by the EPA.  This substance is present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore is included in our risk management program.\n\n?    Ammonia (anhydrous)- Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant.  It is received into the plant by truck, however deliveries of ammonia are infrequent.  One of the primary refrigeration vessels is the High Pressure Receiver vessel. This vessel has a maximum inventory of approximately 9,500 pounds that is controlled through administrative procedures.  The refrigeration system at the facility has a total capacity of approximately 26,000 pounds (~5,200 gallons) of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (worst-case & alternate-cases)\n\nThe RMP rule requirements for identification and selection of a worst-case hazard scenario are prescriptive"

      "SummaryText": ".  These requirements negate most safety systems designed to mitigate an incidental release.   Based on USEPA defined Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance, Harlan Bakeries has one worst-case hazard scenario for the toxic material handled onsite.  This scenario is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an EPA defined concentration (endpoint) resulting from an accidental release.\n\nHarlan?s worst-case toxic scenario involves anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant and is stored under pressure in a vessel located outside.  This vessel, the High Pressure Receiver, may have a maximum of 9,500 pounds of liquid ammonia at any one time.  The scenario uses the EPA's theoretical assumption that the vessel catastrophically fails and liquid ammonia is released to the atmosphere.  It completely negates any mitigation attempts and assumes that all 9,500 pounds of ammonia can be spilled onto the ground and evaporated within 10 minutes to form a toxic vapor cloud that drifts offsite into the surrounding community.\n\nUsing the USEPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, dated October 1998, to determine the greatest downwind distance, it was determined that an ammonia vapor cloud may extend 1.2 miles from the plant.  This calculation was based on the EPA recommended guide for ammonia.\n\nThe USEPA rule also requires that alternate or more likely accident scenarios involving regulated chemical be identified.  Other more likely ammonia incidents were assessed at Harlan using parameters prescribed in the RMP regulation.  The analysis of the alternate scenarios included mitigation affects from both passive and active safety systems.\n\nHarlan conducted an iterative assessment of several alternate or more likely scenarios.  From the various scenarios assessed, Harlan selected the following:\n\n?    An inadvertent failure of an ammonia transfer hose that results in complete separation from the connection point was selected as the alter"

Evaporation of the liquid ammonia could result in the formation of a vapor cloud extending 0.11 miles (581 feet) from the site.\n\nAccidental release program & chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nAfter significant modification and expansion of our facility's refrigeration capacity, ammonia inventories were increased at or above the threshold quantities established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which required the development of a Process Safety Management (PSM) ?prevention? program.\n\nHarlan Bakeries contracted with an outside consulting firm to assist in the development of the prevention program tailored exclusively to ammonia refrigeration operations.  This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective of the program is to ensure complete containment of ammonia through safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\nHarlan Bakeries has completed 100% of its initial process hazard analysis (PHA) requirement for the ammonia refrigeration system.  A PHA was conducted in January 2000 that resulted in 91 recommendations.  A second Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the current refrigeration modifications has been scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003.  The majority of the initial PHA recommendations have been negated by the current refrigeration system modification.  However, these initial recommendations are scheduled for review during the follow-up PHA scheduled for later in 2003.  \n\nFive year accident history\n\nHarlan has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  This process is defined and explained by Harlan?s Incident Investigation procedure.
