SICPA has been working with Jae Kyung (Min.Kyung@epa.gov) and Liam Fisher (Fisher.Liam@epa.gov). \n1.\tOVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY \nSICPA Securink Corporation is a manufacturer of specialty inks located at 8000 Research Way Springfield, VA 22153.  The company has two distinct operations at this facility 1. ink manufacturing and 2. varnish manufacturing.  The ink manufacturing plant does not use any chemicals above a regulatory threshold that are subject to Risk Management Planning.  The varnish manufacturing plant produces a variety of resin blends and specialized polymers, including urethanes.  The following information primarily pertains to varnish manufacturing operations which does have one chemical (TDI) above the RMP threshold.\n2.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nThe SICPA Securink site began operations in 1984. Securink's policy is to minimize the use of hazardous chemicals and implement effective control measures to safely handle and use those hazardous substances which are necessary for successful operations. There have been no accidental releases during this time (other than small drips during transfer of TDI).\nUnder the company's Emergency Response Plan, specific responsibilities are assigned to the management team. The plan describes the installation and operation of relevant safety systems and emergency equipment and training. SICPA is a non-responding facility and would utilize the Fairfax fire department and the local LEPC for spill response.\n3.\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \nA commercial blend of 2,4 TDI and 2,6 TDI with the CAS number 26474-62-5 this is a listed toxic substance used to produce urethane polymers in the varnish plant.  TDI is reacted with other chemicals under controlled conditions to produce special polymers which are used in SICPA's ink products.\nNo other regulated substances are present above the threshold quantities. \n4.\tTDI STORAGE\nThe B build"

      "SummaryText": "ing varnish plant and TDI tank and system is anticipated to be emptied in Q125. It is a 2500-gallon stainless steel tank, having a maximum capacity of approximately 26,000 pounds.  Currently approximately 5,000 lbs. remain in the tank and no more will be added.\nThe new varnish plant (C-Building) and TDI tank are now responsible for all varnish manufacturing. The transition to the new varnish plant (and TDI tank) began in 2021.\nThis new TDI tank is a 1,000-gallon tank with an operating limit of 8,000 lbs. This tank is stored inside a dedicated building. The TDI tank is filled from specially designed mono-containers that contain 2000 lbs. of TDI.  Up to two mono containers can be stored inside the TDI containment building that also houses the TDI storage tank. SICPA\u0092s plan when designing and building the new TDI tank system would be that it would be below the RMP reporting threshold of 10,000 lbs.  SICPA consulted with Jae Kyung (Min.Kyung@epa.gov) and Liam Fisher (Fisher.Liam@epa.gov) who have recommended that this new tank plus mono-containers should be registered into EPA\u0092s Risk Management program.  \n5.\tWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOs\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for this facility involves a possible rupture of either TDI storage tank containing its maximum capacity of TDI.  \n1.\tB building TDI tank: Under this worst-case scenario, there would be no off-site impact for a catastrophic release from this tank based on following the existing worst-case model performed by the Society of Plastics Industry that has been used in all previous filings by SICPA.  \n2.\tThe worst-case scenario for the C-building TDI tank was modeled using the EPA RMP Comp Model available on the RMP web site. This model shows offsite consequences even though the new tank is smaller with improved safety features. RMP Comp is a conservative model for TDI and defaults to 0.1-mile offsite consequences.  Based in this model there is a school and small industrial business within the 0.1-mile radius."

In the future SICPA plans to remodel this worst-case scenario possibly showing a lesser off-site impact. \n6.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nTDI tanks are located inside dedicated secured rooms. Safety features are noted in the filing, but include: \n\u0095\tSecondary containment inside dedicated buildings.\n\u0095\tTemperature controls\n\u0095\tNitrogen blanket to prevent contact with water vapor.\n\u0095\tTDI air monitoring and detection system for the C building tank only.\n\u0095\tTemperature sensors.  \n\u0095\tWater deluge system for the B building tank only.\n\u0095\tSite security\n7.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no releases of TDI since the facility began operations, except for minor drips from tank filling.  \n8.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nSICPA has developed an emergency response plan incorporating procedures for spill reporting, spill prevention, recognition of emergency conditions, control and containment of releases, training, and emergency drills.  \nA copy of this plan has been provided to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Departments.  SICPA has coordinated familiarization tours to emergency responders.  \nCommunication and preplanning have occurred with the Fairfax fire department and the LEPC for Fairfax County.  The LEPC plan references the following for the SICPA Securink Facility:\n\"A detailed emergency response plan is in place for the facility.  Standard Operating Procedures for response to emergencies involving the above chemicals would be followed by responding Fire and Rescue personnel.  The first-due fire station has a pre-plan for this facility.\"\nFurthermore, the LEPC's emergency response plan, referring to the presence of TDI at SICPA's facility, describes the probability of hazard containment as:\"... high, based on absence of prior emergency incidents involving hazardous materials, presence of spill control equipm"
