American Pacific believes the public recognizes its commitment to be a good citizen of the community based on its community involvement and its care in the design and operation of the plant to protect the community.\n\n2. The stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\n\n\nAmerican Pacific has one EPA Risk Management Plan regulated substances on site which is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAmerican Pacific has two anhydrous ammonia tanks at the WECCO division, which can contain 82,400 pounds of ammonia each.  Ammonia can be received by truck but is normally received by rail.  A rail car may contain up to 180,000 pounds of ammonia.  The ammonia is used in three ammonium chloride reactors.  Ammonia is transported via pipeline within the facility.\n\n3. Facility description, Worst Case Release Scenarios, and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nAmerican Pacific has prepared one worst-case and two alternate release scenarios for ammonia but will not include it in the executive summary due to national security reasons and EPA's suggestion.  \n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nAmerican Pacific is regulated under OSHA's PSM standard for ammonia and EPA's regulations on risk management programs, which require a 14-point program to prevent accidents.  American Pacific has a maintenance program that generates preventive maintenance work orders routinely through a computer program.  American Pacific's operators and mechanics are well trained.  American Pacific has written operating procedures which meet ISO 9001 requirements for a quality system and are audited by outside"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAmerican Pacific Corporation is dedicated to preventing chemical emergencies.  American Pacific has several divisions in its Utah operations.  The divisions are contiguously located on American Pacific property.  The facility handles anhydrous ammonia which is regulated under RMP.  American Pacific manufactures oxidizers (perchlorates).  Anhydrous ammonia is an essential ingredient in ammonium perchlorate.  Ammonium perchlorate is a critical component for the defense of our country and is an important ingredient in the space program for both manned and unmanned vehicles.  Ammonia is a toxic substance that is widely used in households in limited concentrations.  The use of Ammonia requires us to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our coworkers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  At American Pacific, it is our policy to adhere to all federal, state, and local regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices designed into the systems.  Our procedures for handling the materials and the training that we have provided to our employees reduce the possibility of an accident.  American Pacific administratively limits the fill ratio of the ammonia tanks to 80% in the perchlorate process, the fill ratio of ammonia tanks in the sodium amide process to 85% all in accordance with good safety practices for the vessels.  American Pacific Senior management has devoted many resources to training our employees to be capable of responding to any situations that could be hazardous and believes the response training is also integral in preventing incidents.  An American Pacific manager has been supported in acting as a member of the Iron County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  American Pacific has also provided"

American Pacific has additionally trained its response team so that a well-trained team is present 24 hours per day, 7 days a week to respond to any emergency in a timely and appropriate fashion.  The emergency response program specifically covers ammonia as well as other materials on site not regulated by EPA under the risk management program.  \n\n5. The five-year accident history\n\nAmerican Pacific has not had an incident involving ammonia in the last 5 yhears. \n\n6. The emergency response program:\n\nAs previously mentioned, American Pacific has a well-trained emergency response organization.  American Pacific has written response procedures on which the team has been trained and the procedures are provided to the Iron County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for coordination.  The response team has periodic drills, which vary from responding to fires and evacuating on-site personnel to responding to spills.  American Pacific has trained local outside response personnel such as the fire department and high way patrol.  American Pacific has served as the site for community drill involving a simulated acid spill in the past and will make itself available for any reasonable requests by the LEPC for future drills.  American Pacific has had a clear history of immediately notifying outside responders in the past (these responses have involved items not regulated under the risk management regulations).  American Pacific has worked side by side with outside responders to provide any information that they may require in preparing their responses to any American Pacific incident.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSeveral changes have been made to equipment and programs to ensure that employees and the community will be safe.  There are currently no other plans for future changes at this time."
