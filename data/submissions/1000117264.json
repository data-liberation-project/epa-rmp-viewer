This emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to EPA prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA emergency response program requirements.\n\nThe Trico Products facility is located at 1995 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas.  The  protective coating of windshield wiper utilizes Chlorine in its process. In this process, the regulated substance handled, is stored in a two 1-ton cylinders and four 150-pounds cylinders.  The facility is manned 24-hours a day and the tank has a fence perimeter to prevent entry from un-authorized personnel.  Self-contained-breathing-apparatus (SCBA) are stored strategically throughout the facility.\n\nThe Trico Products accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements.\n\n- Strong adherence to Process Safety Management;\n- High level of training of the operators;\n- Preventive maintenance program;\n- Use of process and safety equipment;\n- Use of accurate and effective operating procedures;\n- Performance of a hazard review assessment of equipment and procedures; and\n- Implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained-breathing-apparatus, Level B protective clothing, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of Chlorine.\n\nNo accidental releases of Chlorine have occurred in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program.  The program includes an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evacuations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nA process hazard analysis for the Chlorine p"
