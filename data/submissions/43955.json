The RMP conforms to the legal requirements established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The purpose of this RMP is to:\n\n\u00bfTo remove one of the previously submitted regulated processes from the plan.  \n\u00bfUpdate the Emulsion Polymer Process to include a new reactor.  \n\u00bfDescribe existing safety systems at the Chester facility that are designed to protect employees, community, environment, and assets;\n\u00bfComply with the applicable EPA regulations:  40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe following executive summary presents an overview of the Chester facility\u00bfs accident prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nOMNOVA SOLUTIONS\u00bf COMMITMENT TO SAFETY:\n\nOMNOVA Solutions and its Chester operations are and always have been committed to safe operations as a high priority. The commitment begins with qualified people and is reflected in all levels of the operation.  All employees at the plant are given the training, tools, and empowerment to perform their part of the operation in a safe manner.    Strict operational controls are in place to ensure a safe facility from the conceptual design stage through the final delivery of products to customers.  Chester has a staff of Safety and Environmental Professionals, Engineers, and Security personnel to assure implementation of an ongoing commitment to the highest standards of safe process management.  This experience and professional competency has resulted in many years of safe operations consistently exceeding the industry average.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED PROCESSES:\n\nOMNOVA Solutions, Chester Plant has two regulated processes.  One process uses 50% Formaldehyde Solution (49% Water) in the production of permanent press finishing resins for the Textiles industry. These resins are non-hazardous clear liquids.  Vinyl Acetate is used in the production of latex polymers"

These latex polymers are non-hazardous white liquids (water based).\n\nOMNOVA no longer manufactures polyamide resin and therefore, no longer uses Ethylene Diamine.  This process has been removed from the Plan.\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe EPA regulations require regulated facilities to provide information for all accidental releases from regulated processes that resulted in (1) deaths, injuries according to the RMP definition, or significant property damage on site, or, (2) known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nNo accidents meeting this regulatory definition have occurred at the Chester facility within the last five years.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS:\n\nAs part of the EPA regulations and Process Safety Management requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) OMNOVA Solutions is required to conduct Hazard Assessments of its regulated processes. The Risk Management regulation also specifically requires offsite consequence analyses in the form of Worst-Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios for certain regulated substances.\n\nOMNOVA Solutions is concerned that these Worst-Case Scenarios, required to be disclosed under the regulation, may overstate the risk of a worst case release.  For example, the EPA published lookup tables do not take any local physical conditions into account.  An alternative to the lookup tables (allowed by the regulation) is to calculate release scenarios based upon recognized risk analysis techniques, or \u00bfmodels.\u00bf  Limited consideration of local conditions is used in the models within strict EPA guidelines.  Accordingly, OMNOVA Solutions uses the EPA recognized models in preparing it\u00bfs release scenarios. While these models may be more accurate, they can still result in highly improbable and in some cases physically impossible risk scenarios.  For example, neither lookup tables nor models allow fo"

The use of models increases the number of specific data points examined and, thus, presents more accurate information using all required inputs.\n\nOMNOVA Solutions has also prepared Alternative Release Scenarios which it believes are more accurate predictions of potential accidental releases from the Chester facility.  Alternative Release Scenarios are by definition more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Scenarios but are still very improbable due to engineering and administrative controls in the facility\u00bfs prevention program.  \n  \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nEPA regulations require facilities to develop one Worst-Case scenario to represent all toxic substances and one Worst-Case scenario to represent all flammable substances from a list of regulated materials.  Additional Worst-Case Scenarios are required if different public receptors (off site residences, businesses or community buildings within a possible impact radius) could be affected by the release of another regulated material.  OMNOVA Solutions is not subject to this additional requirement.\n\nWhen examining the following Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios, it is important to keep in mind that OMNOVA Solutions has numerous preventative measures in place at its Chester facility to effectively prevent these situations.  These measures, most of which were not taken into consideration under EPA regulations, include leak detection systems, continuous monitoring, automated controls, emergency shutdowns, secondary containment and employees specially trained in handling these materials and in emergency responses methods.\n\nFlammable Materials\nThe Chester facility uses none of the 63 listed flammable substances above the regulated threshold.  \n\nToxic Materials\nThe Chester facility only uses two of the 77 regulated toxic substances on site above the regulatory"

These are 50% Formaldehyde Solution and Vinyl Acetate.\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario for a regulated toxic substance is the release of the entire contents of a Vinyl Acetate railcar.  This scenario assumes that there is no containment of the material and that the entire contents of the railcar would spill and vaporize.  It also assumes, unrealistically, that facility employees would do nothing to mitigate the release to limit the amount that is evaporated to the atmosphere.  OMNOVA Solutions does not think that this worst-case is likely and may not be possible due to the conservative assumptions required by the regulation.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nApplicable EPA regulations also require facilities to submit one alternative release scenario to represent all flammable substances and one to represent each toxic substance. \n\nFlammable Alternative\nThe Chester facility does not use any of the listed flammable substances above the regulated threshold.  \n\nToxic Alternatives\nThe facility is required to submit two alternative scenarios, one for each of the two toxic substances listed above.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for Vinyl Acetate involves failure of a pressurized pipeline, which would result in spraying material outside the storage containment area. \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for Formaldehyde involves failure of a tank truck unloading hose, resulting in a release of 50% Formaldehyde Solution from the hose.\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nOMNOVA Solutions\u00bf Chester facility began a formal Process Safety Management Program in 1992 when OSHA promulgated \u00a729 CFR 1910.119.
