The Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies At Your Facility\r\nThe Coalinga Cogeneration Company (CCC) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. Applicable procedures of the State of California and United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) are adhered to, including training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. CCC recognizes its responsibility to make employee, community and environmental protection an integral part of daily operations. It is committed to being a responsible member within the community by giving top priority to conducting operations in a safe and environmentally sound manner.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of CCC that every employee is entitled to a safe and healthful place in which to work. CCC incorporates the concepts of environmental responsibility and with safety into all aspects of base operations. As part of CCC's obligation to protect the integrity of human, environmental, physical, and financial resources, and to conserve and efficiently utilize those resources, CCC will: comply fully with laws regulating environmental protection and employee health and safety; furnish work places free of recognized hazards likely to cause injury to people and the environment; train employees in safe and environmentally conscious practices and require compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations, policies, and procedures; and provide professional staff to maintain and support environmental, health, and safety programs.\r\n\r\n2.

      "SummaryText": "eduction (SCR) technology to reduce combustion Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) emissions. SCR is a post-combustion flue gas NOx emission control technology that removes NOx from the flue gas downstream from the combustion process. A reducing agent is used to reduce NOx emissions by oxidation-reduction reactions in the presence of a catalyst. Injection of the reducing agent/air mixture into the combustion exhaust stream before the catalyst initiates the reactions and achieves the desired removal of NOx emissions upstream from the stack. \r\n\r\nThe CCC uses anhydrous ammonia (Chemical Abstracts Service #7664-41-7) as the reagent for the SCR system. The maximum amount stored on site is 69,960 lbs.  A single 15,000-gallon (69,960 lbs) anhydrous ammonia tank is provided to support the SCR at the CCC. Maintenance and loading of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank has been contracted out. Transport of anhydrous ammonia to CCC is accomplished using tanker trucks, with individual deliveries of about 5,000 to 7,000 gallons. Deliveries are scheduled every three to five weeks. The storage tank lies within an enclosed dike and is equipped with a deluge system. The deluge system is currently not in use.  In addition, the ammonia-handling facility is equipped with process area detectors to protect workers and equipment in the event of a malfunction.\r\n\r\nThe use of equipment for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia in support of the CCC SCR system will require compliance with federal Risk Management Program (RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP), Federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and California OHSA PSM. The quantity of ammonia on-site exceeds Federal RMP and CalARP threshold quantities. CCC is required to implement a federal RMP plan pursuant to Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. CCC is also required to implement a CalARP plan pursuant to California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19,"

The CalARP plan is administered by the local administering agency (AA). In Fresno County, the AA is the local Certified Unified Program Agency - the Fresno County Department of Public Health (FCDPH). The RMP plan is submitted to both the US-EPA and FCDPH. Additional information specific to CalARP is submitted to the FCDPH. The RMP plan is submitted to US-EPA using the RMP*eSubmit program for online reporting.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nCCC complies with federal and state RMP and PSM requirements, and is a key component of the CCC prevention program. CCC applies RMP and PSM processes to the entire plant. The CCC RMP and PSM plans are located in the control room and are updated as required to reflect changes in operating procedures.
