As part of this 5 year update, resubmitted to EPA on June 21, 2004, USS-POSCO has included the following:\n\no Following a significant incident at a source, the 5-year accident history information will be updated within six months to reflect the incident.\n\nO If the emergency contact at the source changes, the RMP will be updated within one month, to include the new emergency contact information. \n\nO A brief description of the OCA (worst case and/or alternate case) has not been included in this executive summary.  EPA prefers that the OCA information is left out of the executive summary to eliminate the possibility of sensitive information getting into the wrong hands, especially with the heightened awareness security. \n\nO The emergency contact?s email address has been included in this RMP submittal. \n\nO The purpose for the RMP submissions has been included?5year re-evaluation and re-submittal to EPA.\n\nO Name, address, and phone number of the contractor used to complete the RMP submittal has been included.\n\nSite Description & Regulated Substances\n\nUSS-POSCO Industries (UPI) is located at 900 Loveridge Road in the city of Pittsburg, California approximately 1/2 mile north of Highway 4.  The UPI property occupies approximately 490 acres.  It is bordered by the New York Slough of the San Joaquin/Sacramento River on the north and by open space and industrial facilities in all other directions.  The nearest residences are located approximately 3/4 miles to the southwest of any facilities handling chemicals regulated under the RMP Rule.\n\nThe plant employs approximately 870 people.  The major divisions within the UPI facility include: the Rolling Division, the Tin Products Division, the Sheet Products Division, the Reliability Division, and the Technology Services Division.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and liquid hydrogen are the only two federally and state regulated substances present at UP"

      "SummaryText": "I.  The sulfuric acid solutions used at UPI are at concentration of 93 weight percent or less and, thus, fall below the concentration threshold established under the RMP Rule.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in liquid form, under pressure, in an outdoor 12,000 gallon supply vessel.  The vessel sits on a concrete pad that is surrounded by a locked fence. \n\nThe amount of ammonia stored in the supply vessel is limited to less than 50% of the vessel capacity, by volume.  The management control to maintain this inventory is that:\n\no Ammonia is ordered only when the tank volume is less than 15% \no Ammonia supplier is contracted to only deliver tank trucks of 3,750 gallons\n\nThese controls result in a maximum inventory ammonia inventory of 5,550 gallons (28,000 pounds at 25oC).  The threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia under the RMP rule is 10,000 pounds.\n\nLiquid hydrogen is stored in two double-walled stainless steel pressure vessels (one 9000-gallon, one 18,000 gallon).  Administrative controls limit the contents of the larger tank to no more than 9,500 pounds of liquid hydrogen.  As the combined inventory for this process is greater than the 10,000 pound RMP threshold, this process is covered.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario as defined by the EPA, is an extremely unlikely event due to many factors, including the age of the process equipment, the prevention program, and the management system.  The worst-case scenarios for the UPI facility are a 10 minute release from anhydrous ammonia storage (Toxic Release Scenario) and liquid hydrogen storage (Flammable Release Scenario).  When determining the quantity released in these worst-case scenarios administrative controls that limit the maximum allowable inventory in both processes were included.  Maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia is limited to less than 50% of vessel capacity and the liquid hydrogen inventory in the largest vessel is limited to 9,500 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case scenario"

To do this, UPI modeled a series of three potential alternative release scenarios (ARS) to establish a reasonable \"outer bound\" for emergency response planning and to provide for explaining potential hazards to the community.  CCCHSD guidance calls for modeling the ARS using very conservative meteorological conditions for emergency response planning purposes.  The US EPA, in its guidance for modeling the ARS, suggests the use of more typical (\"average\") meteorological conditions that represent conditions much more likely to occur. \n\nSince the liquid hydrogen process qualifies for Program Level 1, no ARS are required for hydrogen.\n\nThe ARS for ammonia included:\n\n1.  Failure of unloading hose\n2. Relief valve discharge\n3. Failure of a 3/4 inch diameter liquid line from vessel\n\nThe results of the ARS modeling have not been included in the executive summary as a description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) is no longer a requirement in this section under the RMP regulation. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Programs\n\nNote that the anhydrous ammonia process is the only Program level 2 or 3 process and, therefore, is the only process requiring a RMP prevention program.

This management system is consistent with the recommendations contained in CCPS Plant Guidelines for Technical Management of Chemical Process Safety.  This management system satisfies the requirements of ? 68.15 of the RMP Rule, and ensures that the risk management program elements are developed, implemented, and continually improved. The management system activities are further discussed below.\n\nO Planning - UPI has an overall risk management program policy that \n  clearly identifies the goals and objectives of the risk management program.\n \nO Organizing - Individuals responsible for each risk management program \n  element have been designated.  The designated individuals are responsible \n  for developing and maintaining policies and procedures for each risk\n  management program element that meet program goals and objectives. \n \nO Implementing - Detailed responsibilities for program implementation \n  may be delegated to other individuals.

The release prevention program at UPI was developed to prevent onsite and offsite impacts to people and the environment.  Therefore, this facility has developed a release prevention program to comply with both the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the OSHA PSM requirements.  The release prevention program includes the following elements: process safety information, PHA, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, PSSR, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, contractors, and others.\n\nThe prevention program elements represent an integrated system of administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.  Many of these prevention program elements (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (i.e., administrative and engineering controls).  These safeguards prevent, detect, or mitigate the effects of accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nEmployee training is also a major focus at UPI.  UPI believes that employees who clearly understand how to safely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents, and increase efficiency.  Therefore, a thorough training program  focused on specific operating procedures and safe work practices is a key element of an effective prevention program.\n\nEmployees involved with operating the process receive training on the  hazards associated with the process, how to operate the process within safe operating limits, and how to handle potential emergencies. The training program satisfies the requirements of ? 68.71 of the RMP Rule and is comprised of the following:\n\no Initial employee training\no Training provid"

The operators receive training specific to the operations of the process once they are assigned.  Various means are used to verify competency, but primary emphasis is placed on on-the-job observation by supervisors.  Documentation of the training is forwarded to the Learning Center for filing and tracking.\n \nIn addition to on-the-job training, UPI personnel are trained in basic safety courses on an ongoing basis.  All operating division employees and all building wardens in non-industrial areas of the plant are designated potential first responders.  Courses they take include: \"Principles of Accident Prevention\", \"CPR\", \"First Aid\", and \"First Responder Training.\"  Operating division employees also regularly attend Safety Committee meetings to discuss safety issues.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nA review of facility incident investigation reports has shown that there have been no incidents involving ammonia or other hazardous substances, for which the onsite or offsite consequences exceeded the reporting requirements of ? 68.42 of the RMP Rule.\n\nFollowing a significant incident of a covered RMP process (anhydrous ammonia or liquid hydrogen), UPI will update the accident history within 6 months to reflect the incident.

      "SummaryText": "estimated residential population within the worst-case endpoint zone.\n\nThe liquid hydrogen process worst-case scenario does not result in any residential population within the endpoint distance zone.\n\nUSS-POSCO Industries (UPI) has a long-standing commitment to business principles which promote the safe, ethical operation of its steel manufacturing facilities in Pittsburg, California.  These principles have resulted in clear UPI business strategies that call for continual improvement of safety, quality, customer satisfaction, protection and preservation of the environment, and community responsibility.  Implementation of, and \nadherence to, these business strategies requires the full commitment of all UPI employees.\n\nUPI policy dictates that each division continuously identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safer technology and procedures.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the facility policy statements and the manual \"Principles of Accident Prevention\", which are available to all employees. UPI stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in written materials  (such as safety and health bulletins) periodically provided to all employees.  UPI safety and environmental programs include monthly safety meetings for all employees and a joint worker/company safety committee. UPI supervisory and management personnel conduct both regularly scheduled and unscheduled (surprise) audits of internal safety, housekeeping and environmental compliance and practice."
