      "SummaryText": "STATUS SUMMARY\n\nTraditionally, the facility has operated chlorine related processes in a batch mode utilizing liquid chlorine purchased in railcars.  In 2007, construction began on processes utilizing similar chemistry with two notable differences:  New production processes operate on a continuous basis and incorporate an electrolysis process to produce chlorine in lieu of purchasing it.  \n\nIn August 2008, start-up was completed and batch operations utilizing liquid chlorine were ceased.  From a safety standpoint, the new processes consume chlorine as soon as it is produced.  There are no chlorine liquefaction or storage capabilities, therefore, chlorine inventory levels are temporarily below the threshold quantities at this time.  The previous batch processes are still operational and being maintained for use as an immediate backup system to the new production processes.  The RMP is being maintained despite the non-presence of chlorine above the threshold level and the batch operation being dormant at this time.  In the event we need to start up the batch processes, a Pre-startup safety review would be undertaken and the LEPC, along with other local responders would be notified.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nChlorine is considered hazardous by EPA; therefore, certain safety precautions are observed when handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the health of the employees at this facility, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. Safety precautions followed by the facility in the use and handling of chlorine come from the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute as well as the recommendations of many of the equipment and systems manufacturers.\n\nIt is this facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. This facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and trains its employees to perform emergency response to "

In addition, the facility has implemented the NC State Pesticide Storage Contingency Plan and has developed a Hazardous Materials Management Plan, all of which address prudent management of the facility's hazardous materials and emergency response procedures, These plans outline who should be contacted and what steps should be taken in the event of an emergency. If an emergency were to occur, it is this facility's policy to alert the following outside agencies: Richmond County LEPC, Hamlet Fire Department, Richmond County Sheriff's Dept, the NC Highway Patrol, Richmond County Medical Services, and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis facility is a chemical manufacturer of agricultural chemicals and bleach. Chlorine is an ingredient used in the manufacture of these products. Liquid chlorine was typically brought onsite in railcars. These railcars are maintained inside the fenced area of the facility. Only one railcar is hooked up to batch processes at any one time, Chlorine detectors are installed at each railcar unloading point. In addition, chlorine has a strong, distinct odor; therefore, a leak should be detected within seconds of occurring by the detectors as well as by human senses. Since detection should occur soon after a leak begins, offsite impacts should be minimal, if any at all occur.\n\nThe liquid chlorine supply system consists of the railcars onsite and associated piping, valves, and detection equipment. In accordance with the recommendations of the Chlorine Institute and our chlorine suppliers, there is a safety shutoff device at the unloading valve on the railcar being unloaded, a safety shutoff valve where the railcar transfer hose attaches to the fixed piping of the plant system, and a safety shutoff valve midway to the process in the event of a problem. These valves can be activated from multiple remote areas of"

Piping has been labeled and color-coded to minimize misidentification.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis manufacturing facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, OSHA's PSM rule and applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility follows the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and its suppliers in the use and handling of chlorine. This includes the design of piping installations, materials of construction, release detection equipment, maintenance procedures, emergency response procedures, and release mitigation equipment and installations as well as normal process activities. The emergency response plan deals with the safety of the employees in the event of an accident and minimizing the release of any chemical onsite and offsite, including chlorine.\n\nEach employee receives hands-on training in the use of emergency mitigation equipment, personal protective equipment, and communications equipment. Each employee receives training in all aspects of the emergency plan and program, and drills are to be performed at least once a year. Training is conducted throughout the year on various aspects of the routine handling and emergency response aspects associated with chlorine. Written procedures have been developed that address all chlorine handling activities from bringing the railcar onto the facility, connecting to and disconnecting from the railcar, to transferring chlorine from the railcar into the process, and includes what to do if abnormal circumstances occur, Employees are observed when performing tasks related to the process and given feedback on their understanding and adherence to written procedures.\n\nOn-site training has been conducted with outside agencies that would be responding to emergencies.

If further action is required to stop a railcar release, employees can install a C-kit on the railcar. It is this facility's policy to notify the following outside agencies in event of emergency: the Richmond County LEPC, Hamlet Fire Department, the Richmond County Sheriff's Department, the NC Highway Patrol, the Richmond County Emergency Medical Services, and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThis facility is constantly looking for ways to improve upon the existing safety systems and on safety for both the employees and members of the surrounding area.  Security systems are being enhanced to facilitate observation in the chlorine process areas of employees performing work tasks, and to enhance observation of a leak or unauthorized access.\n"
