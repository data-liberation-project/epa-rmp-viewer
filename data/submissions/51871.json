Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Portsmouth site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why US Amines has a \"zero incident\" goal.  \n\nOur Facility:\n\nWe manufacture several different chemicals in the family of amines.  Our products are used to produce agricultural chemicals, engineering resins, and drugs.  We have about 14 site employees and 10 resident contractors.  US Amines uses a variety of raw materials including anhydrous ammonia and ethylamine to produce several amines including allylamine within its Amines Plant operations at the Portsmouth, Virginia site.  \n\nPlant Safety Activities:\n\nThe site has a plant manager who oversees all plant activities.  The staff includes a production manager, maintenance manager, training coordinator, technical support, a part-time nurse who oversees the plant medical program.  All plant employees must attend at least one safety meeting per month.  Safety meetings include training on regulatory requirements and plant specific issues.  Testing is conducted in safety meetings to insure the information is understood.\n\nPlant operators are members of the emergency response team.  They are trained in the specifics of incident command, emergency response, and medical response.  The plant conducts weekly tests of the plant alarm system and conducts emergency response drills with the local fire department.\n\nThe US Amines Portsmouth Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\nThe US Amines Portsmouth plant complies with RMP and OSHA 1910.119, (the OSH"
