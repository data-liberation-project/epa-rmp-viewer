Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Star Roses has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Star Roses, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Star Roses has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical              | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration        Anhydrous Ammonia               17,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP and RMP obligat"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\n\n\n\nStar Roses operates a commercial cold storage for bare root roses in Dinuba, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(7) Rooms\n\n(1) Wet Room\n\n(1) Loading Dock\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\n\n\nStar Roses is located at 41700 Road 100, Dinuba, CA 93618. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.546986, -119.349102. The facility is located approximately 14 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nStar Roses is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Star Roses has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes: \n\n\n\nMachinery Room\n\n(4) Reciprocating compressors\n\n(4) Oil separators\n\n(2) High pressure receivers\n\n(2) Liquid transfer vessels\n\n(2) Main suction accumulators\n\n\n\nOutside of the "

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nStar Roses has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Star Roses facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient mann"

Nevertheless, Star Roses continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Star Roses' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Star Roses' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nStar Roses has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Star Roses has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Star Roses now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Star Roses employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Star Roses will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
