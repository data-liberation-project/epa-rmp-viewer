The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n(7) Rooms\r\n(1) Wet Room\r\n(1) Loading Dock\r\n\r\n1.2.2 Facility Location\r\n\r\nStar Roses is located at 41700 Road 100, Dinuba, CA 93618. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.546986, -119.349102. The facility is located approximately 14 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in an area of minimal flood hazard.\r\n\r\nStar Roses is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Star Roses has a 1-2% chance of experiencing potentially minor-damage due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery room.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nStar Roses has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.

Nevertheless, Star Roses continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Star Roses' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Star Roses' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nStar Roses has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Star Roses has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Star Roses now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Star Roses employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Star Roses will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
