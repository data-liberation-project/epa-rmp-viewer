This successful operating record is due to the City's commitment to ongoing training programs, operating procedures, and computer-generated maintenance activities.\n\nStationary Source and the Substance Handled\n\nThe City of Columbus operates a 4.5-MGD (by design) municipal wastewater treatment facility at 865 14th Avenue South in Columbus, Nebraska.  Discharge from the treatment facility enters the Loup River.  The facility uses chlorine to reduce the pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria and viruses in the wastewater discharge to levels below those which can be achieved through ordinary secondary treatment.  The use of chlorine reduces the threat to the quality of recreational waters. \n\nThe facility uses sulfur dioxide to remove residual chlorine remaining after the disinfection process and prior to discharging to the receiving waters.  This is done because it has been shown that residual chlorine is harmful to some species of fish and carcinogenic to other wildlife.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide utilized in the disinfection and dechlorination processes arrive at the facility in one ton containers that are stored inside a ventilated building equipped with leak detection devices.  The maximum quantities of chorine and sulfur dioxide stored at the facility are 10,000 pounds and 8,000 pounds, respectively.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nOne worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario was assessed for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  To ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The worst-case scenario allows consideration of passive mitigation measures.  The worst-case"

Active mitigation measures, as well as passive mitigation measures, can be used in determining the alternative release scenario.\n\nAccording to EPA, the toxic endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been defined to be 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) 0.0078 mg/L (3 ppm), respectively.  An airborne concentration that is used as the toxic endpoints is the maximum airborne concentrations below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process.  Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information.  The population number is reported as part of the EPA submittal.  This method greatly overestimates the population potentially exposed to a chlorine or sulfur dioxide, because the chlorine or sulfur dioxide plume would seek lowest elevations in the direction of the predominant winds.  Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method.\n\nRelease scenarios and distances to toxic endpoints are discussed in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\nChlorine\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nFor the chlorine process at the Columbus WWTF, the worst-case release results from a one-ton chlorine cylinder (maximum amount held in a single vessel) rupturing when unloaded from the delivery truck and its contents escaping to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.

The flexible connector ruptures and the pressure regulators at both the point of injection and the storage cylinder shut down the flow of chlorine gas.
