Values for these parameters were chosen based on the guidelines provided in this section and in 40 CFR 68.22.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tToxic Endpoint\n\nThe EPA has established endpoints for the purpose of determining the distance over which releases could pose hazards to the public or the environment.  For toxic substances they are in the form of minimum concentration levels for each substance and are listed in an appendix to the RM Program regulations.\n\nToxic substance endpoints are based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association's (AIHA's) Emergency Response Planning Guideline - 2 (ERPG-2).  ERPG-2 values represent the maximum airborne concentration that AIHA believes nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to an hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious human health effects or symptoms that could impair their ability to take protective action. \n\n The ERPG-2 for anhydrous ammonia is presently 200 ppm (0.24 mg/L). This endpoint was used for the analysis of the worst-case and the alternative toxic release scenarios.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tWind Speed/Atmospheric Stability Class\n\nWind speed is an estimate of how fast the wind is traveling.  The wind speed may be expressed in miles per hour (mph), meters per second (m/s), or knots.\n\nAtmospheric stability class is a general indication of the degree of mixing present in the atmosphere.  It is a function of wind speed and solar radiation.  Stability class A represents extremely unstable atmospheric conditions with a high mixing.  A stability conditions occur on clear days with high wind speeds. Stability class F represents extremely stable or calm conditions with little atmospheric mixing.  F stability conditions occur on overcast nights with low wind speeds.  Refer to Exhibit 2 in the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance for more information on stability class.\n\nA wi"

The ammonia refrigeration system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program because there is more than 10,000# on site. \n\nThis report describes the results of a hazard assessment conducted to analyze the ammonia located at the Disputanta plant.  The purpose of the hazard assessment was to evaluate the impact of significant accidental releases on the public health and the environment, and to develop of history of such releases.  The scope of this report is limited to the equipment and procedures associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at the Disputanta, Virginia.  The hazard assessment did not address the hazards of shipping ammonia to this site.  The scope of this report was further limited to a review of the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  The procedures used to identify these scenarios are discussed in the following sections.\n\nLarry Aleksandrich has expended his best professional efforts in performing this work.  However, it should be noted that this report describes a joint work effort between Larry Aleksandrich and FOOD LION  personnel"

Plants that handle regulated toxic substances must analyze:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOne worst-case release scenario for the toxic substance that results in the greatest distance in any direction above the toxic endpoint.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAdditional worst-case release scenarios if other release scenarios could affect different public receptors. \n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAt least one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in covered processes.\n\n3.2\tDefine the Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario is defined as the release of the largest quantity of a toxic material from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\nThe largest single vessel or process line containing a RM Program listed toxic material at the Disputanta plant is the ammonia receiver located in the Engine Room.  The worst-case toxic release scenario involves a release from the receiver.\n\nThere were no additional worst-case toxic release scenarios identified that could affect receptors different from those potentially affected by a release from the receiver.  Therefore, only one worst-case toxic release scenario was analyzed.\n\n3.3\tDetermine"

      "SummaryText": "the Release Rate for the Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario can take into account administrative controls that are in place to limit the maximum quantity of the toxic substance in the vessel or pipe.  Administrative controls are defined in the regulations as written procedural mechanisms used for hazard control.\n\nThe ammonia system contains a maximum ammonia inventory of 14,000 pounds. \n\nWe next determined whether any passive mitigation systems can be considered during the worst-case scenario analysis.  Passive mitigation is defined in the regulations as equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical, or other energy input.  Passive mitigation systems must be able to withstand the physical effects of the worst-case accident scenario if they are to be considered.\n\nThe compressor room was considered as passive mitigation during the worst-case analysis of the ammonia receiver.\n\nSince the worst-case toxic release scenario involves the release of liquid under pressure (from a vessel or pipe above 0 psig), we assumed that the total amount of material was released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The release rate, in pounds per minute, is the total mass released (in pounds) divided by 10 (minutes).\n\nFor a worst-case toxic release scenario involving the ammonia high pressure receiver, the total release rate is 1,400 pounds of gas per minute (14,000 pounds over a 10 minute period).\n\n3.4\tDefine the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nAlternative release scenarios represent scenarios that are more realistic than the worst-case scenarios.  These scenarios should be considered in the facility's emergency response plan.  At least one alternative release scenario must be analyzed for each toxic substance handled in a covered process.  The release involved must be large enough to exceed the toxic endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.\n\nIn order to identify the alternative release scenario, we reviewed the facility accid"
