(the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION: The primary activity at the site relative ro Risk Management Planning is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distibuted for direct application and is used in the process of blending mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. It is stored in a storage tank with a capacity of 53,000 lbs. nurse tanks totaling 149,000 pounds. the total pounds of anhydrous ammonia is 202,000 lbs.Asafety training program has been developed for the transfer of anhydrous ammonia in the blending of mixed-grade fertilizers. Safety training will take place semi-annually with those individuals involved in the blending of mixed-grade fertilizers.\n\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS: A) The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance ro the end point of dispersion of 200 parts per million, or ppm, is estimated to be about 1.8 miles. B) The alternate case scenario, based on the five year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 26,600 pounds. The distance to the e"

      "SummaryText": "nd point of disperion is estimated to be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. In addition, Standard K-61.1, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia of the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The facility has : a) a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and b) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
