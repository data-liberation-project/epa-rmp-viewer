              "Description": "Dehydrated feed gas enters the unit at current flow rate, and conditions of 360 psig and 120 degrees F. The gas is cooled to 52 degrees F by a heat exchanger with the residue gas in Feed/Residue Exchanger. The cooled gas is then chilled to 40 degreesF by heat exchange with the propane refrigerant in the Feed Gas Chiller. The decrease intemperature causes a small portion of the feed gas to condense. Although ass the components in the feed gas are condense to some extent, the heavier components such as heptane and octane, will condense more readilu than the lighter components, suchas methane and ethane. As a result, the liquid portion of the chiller effluent will be more concentrated in the heavy ends, and the vapor portion will be more concentrated in the light ends.The Liquid Vapor portions of the chiller effluent are seperated in the Cold Separator. The liquid exits the bottom of the separator and flows to the liquid product stablizing system wich is discussed below. The vapor, called residue gas exits the top of the separator. The separator is equipped with amist pad to scrub entrained liquid droplets out of the gas stream. The scrubbed gas is heated to aaaaaabout 110 degrees F by heat exchange with the feed gas in the Feed/Residue Exchanger. Then the warm residue gas exits the unit and flows to the pipeline, It will have a dew point of 40 degrees F. In the pipeline, liquid will not condense out of the residue gas unless the gas temperature drops below the Cold Separator temperature of 40 degrees F. The Liquids are stored in a 30,000 gal. storage vessel",

The compression was brought on line in Sept. of 2007. The process was in place.Low pressure inlet gas enters the facility from several pipe lines and is manifoiled in to the 4 Compressor on location, The gas is then compressed up to 350 psig, send throung a TEG water removeal station and then send to a Natural Gas Dewpoint Plant where the gas is cooled and the C-3 plus Hydrocarbons are removed. The Stripped Gas is then Metered and solded to Columbea Gas Transmission. The Liquids stripped from the Natural Gas are sent from the Plant to a 30,000 Storage Tank and loaded on a Truck and sent to Mark West Hydrocarbons in Sialom, Ky. The Facility produces approx. 3000 gals. 15,000 lbs. of Hydrocarbons per day. The Hydrocarbon make up of Liquid is as follows .5% ethane, 6% propane, 8.4% Butanes, 22.6% pentanes and 58% C-6plus.The weight of the total Liquids is 150,000 lbs.

Ethane 5% @ 3.11 lbs. per gal, 4332 lbs., Propane 6% @ 4.224 lbs per gall or 6801lbs, 15% Butanes @ 4.865 lbs per gal. or 20656 lbs., Pentane 22.5% @ 5.2 lbs per gal. or 26,675 lbs., C-6 plus 52.5% @ 5.8 lbs. per gal. or 76,696 lbs.                                                                                    These factors give the total weight of the Liquids 136,168 lbs.
