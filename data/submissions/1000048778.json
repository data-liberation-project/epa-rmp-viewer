This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of the regulated substances.  \"A\" and \"B\" kits are available for containment in case of a gas leak.\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary function is the production and distribution of industrial gases.  We have one regulated substance, chlorine, present at this location.  The maximum amount stored are 60,000 pounds of chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in 150 pound cylinders and one-ton containers.\n\n\n\nChlorine is received and stored in pre-filled cylinders.  None of the chlorine is used at our facility.  The accidental release program for chlorine centers around the proper and safe handling of cylinders and containers.  Proper equipment is provided and training such as forklift operation is documented.\n\n\n\nThere has been no accidental release during the previous five years.\n\n\n\nOxarc has a written emergency response plan to deal with the accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes provisions for notification of neighbors and emergency response agencies, evacuation, and  first aid and medical treatment.  The plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place.\n\n\n\n"
