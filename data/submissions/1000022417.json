Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR 68.155(a))\nThe facility complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the Frutchey's policy to notify the Oakley Fire Department or the Saginaw County Sheriff's Office.  Frutchey's Health, Safety, and Environmental Program is committed to provide safe working conditions, and preventing accidents and damages to employees, the environment, and the general public.   \n\n1.2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\nThe Frutchey Bean Company - Oakley, Michigan Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, receives, stores, and distributes anhydrous ammonia for direct application and blending for mixed-grade fertilizers used for crop production nutrients.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is 394,545 pounds, stored in a 18,000 gallon bulk storage vessel and 69 nurse tanks.\n\n1.3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n1.3.1. Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\nFrutchey maintains a separate written Emergency Response Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Fa"

Frutchey inspects the 18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessel, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps on a monthly basis, and documents the inspection results.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n1.3.2. Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, Frutchey maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n1.3.3. Training\n\nFrutchey has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed.  In addition, employees not operating the anhydrous ammonia process are involved in safety training on the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.3.4. Mechanical Integrity\n\nFrutchey performs documented maintenance checks on anhydrous ammonia storage and transfer equipment to ensure proper functions.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nWhen outside contractors are required for maintenance and construction activities, those personnel are accompanied by Frutchey employees or are briefed by the area supervisor on the rules, regulations, and emergency procedures outlined in the Emergency Response Pl"

Contractors use hot work permits, confined space permits, comply with lockout procedures, and use appropriate personal protective equipment when needed.  Contractors are briefed on the emergency alarm procedures and emergency rendezvous point.  Contractors must sign the visitor log.  The supervisor debriefs the contractor after each day.\n\n1.3.5. Compliance Audits\n\nFrutchey conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are performed at least every 3 years as required by 40 CFR 68.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n1.3.6. Incident Investigation\n\nFrutchey promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  The anhydrous ammonia spill release reporting procedures are found in the Emergency Response Plan spill procedures.  Report forms that will be completed in the event of an incident or possible incident are found in the Emergency Response Plan and the RMP.\n\n1.3.7. Employee Participation\n\nFrutchey believes accident prevention is a team effort.  Frutchey employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, Frutchey employees have access to information created as part of the Facility's implementation of the RMP.\n\n1.4. Five-year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(e))\n\nAn accidental release of anhydrous ammonia resulting in death, injuries, significant property damage, sheltering in place, or causing environmental damage on-site or off-site has not occurred within the past five years.\n\n1.5.

      "SummaryText": "n the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facility's policy to notify the Saginaw County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security and request that they respond to the emergency.  The facility has discussed this policy with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Frutchey's Oakley Facility has an Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of an anhydrous ammonia accidental release.  Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  In the event of an anhydrous ammonia accident, first aid procedures for anhydrous ammonia exposure, and procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the local fire department, Saginaw County Emergency Coordinator and sheriff.  A site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on the site are included in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n1.6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety (40 CFR 68.155(g)\n\nMechanical integrity checks, maintenance checks, compliance audits, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety.  Frutchey has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety regarding the anhydrous ammonia process when necessary.  No changes have been scheduled at this time.\n"
