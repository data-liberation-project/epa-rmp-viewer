The facility also includes a fully permitted waste fuel storage facility that blends waste fuels for energy recovery by the rotary cement kiln.  The facility generally receives liquid and solid hazardous waste fuel via truck and railcar.\r\n\r\n(a) The facility is committed to the safety and health of its employees and operating safely in the community.  Facility personnel receive training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response as provided in the facility's RCRA permit, the RMP regulations and as appropriate, other regulations (e.g. MSHA, OSHA) and industry standards (e.g API).  Topics discussed to prevent hazards include: site access, inspections, location and operation of emergency response equipment, utilization of existing safety measure (e.g., berms, containment), and the handling of incompatible wastes, first aid and a host of safety programs.  Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and minor releases.  The Dorchester County Emergency Management Department (EMD) and Harleyville Fire Department will respond in the event of a fire or release beyond the incipient stage.\r\n\r\n(b) The facility consists of all manufacturing equipment necessary for the production of portland and masonry cement, including: cement kiln, clinker cooler, raw mill, finish mills, packing machine, and bulk loading facilities.  The liquid waste fuel tank farm consists of three (3) 80,000 gallon storage tanks, one (1) 50,000 gallon storage tank, and one (1) 6,000 gallon direct burn tanker, all of which are interconnected as well as connected to the rotary kiln. The facility may stage incoming waste fuel in up to twenty-one (21) railcars at the site (each with a nominal capacity of 27,000 gallons) and also stores site generated wastes in up to one hundred (100) 55-gallon drum equivalents (5,500 gallons).

The regulated substances potentially handled above their regulatory thresholds include:  Acrylonitrile; Allyl Alcohol; Ammonia (20% concentration or greater); Carbon Disulfide; Chloroform; and Vinyl Acetate Monomer.\r\n\r\n(c) As part of the facility's RCRA permit and MSHA/OSHA requirements, the facility provides regular employee training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response.  Personnel are also aware of the physical and environmental hazards associated with handling/processing waste fuels.  The objective of Giant's accident prevention program is to develop a proactive approach to the identification, evaluation, and prevention of chemical releases which may result from causes such as the lack of appropriate procedures, human error, or equipment failure. Giant strives to meet this objective through the implementation of a Prevention Program designed to comply with the Program Level 2 requirements of RMP regulations. The key elements of this program are: \r\n\r\n1. Safety and Health Information\r\n2. Hazard Review\r\n3. Operating Procedures\r\n4. Training\r\n5. Maintenance\r\n6. Compliance Audits;\r\n7. Incident Response; and\r\n8. Incident Investigation.\r\n\r\n(d) The facility has not experienced a Clean Air Act reportable accident under the criteria established during the past five years.\r\n\r\n(e) Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and releases only and Giant is not considered a \"responding facility\" under the Risk Management Plan regulations. In addition, the facility has coordinated it response activities with the local response agencies and therefore, is not required to implement an \"Emergency Response Plan\" under the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a RCRA-permitted facility Giant has developed and implemented a Contingency Plan under the Federal RCRA regulations. This Contingency Plan provides detailed response,"

The facility maintains emergency equipment to use in the event or a fire or release (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), spill control equipment).  \r\n\r\nThe Dorchester County EMD and Harleyville Fire Department are aware of the operations at the facility and coordination agreements with these agencies are maintained as part of the facility's Contingency Plan.  \r\n\r\n(f) The facility provides refresher employee training regularly that incorporates safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response.  Off-site contractors are provided safety training as appropriate.  Response equipment is regularly maintained for immediate use if necessary.
