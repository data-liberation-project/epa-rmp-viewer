Training\r\n\r\nWES has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations at this facility.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request or need. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\r\n\r\nF. Contractors\r\n\r\nWES uses Contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The plant was purchased from Nuevo Midstream, LLC late in 2014.  The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are transported onward to another facility for processing.\r\n\r\nWES has acommitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Ramsey Gas Plant is located near Orla, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products from raw natural gas:\r\n\r\n1.
