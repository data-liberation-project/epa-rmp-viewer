This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in all phases of the process, including design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, should a release does occur, our highly trained personnel, working in cooperation with appropriate governmental and local agencies, will quickly respond to control and contain the release. In the unlikely event of a catastrophic release, the refinery, working in conjunction with local emergency management staff, is well prepared to respond and mitigate adverse consequences to the community or the environment. The refinery maintains a comprehensive emergency response plan with Stark County Department of Emergency Services.  Emergency notification of the public is coordinated through these agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Marathon Dickinson Refinery, located in Dickinson, ND, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil and soy oil, including atmospheric tower bottoms, diesel, naphtha, natural gas liquids. The refinery has several regulated flammables (such as propane and butane) within natural gas liquids and other intermediate process streams.  The refinery does not store regulated toxic substances above a threshold quantity in a process at the refinery.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Marathon Dickinson Refinery.

Examples of employee participation include but are not limited to updating and compiling technical documents, serving on various committees, developing procedures, and participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan. In addition, the refinery has a number of programs in place that address process safety and employee safety issues. These processes include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Marathon Dickinson Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents to support safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is available to all employees through a computerized access system.

The refinery has a computerized process control system which helps the operators to ensure that the process is maintained within these limits. Process control systems, monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) provide a safe operating environment. \r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Marathon Dickinson Refinery has a comprehensive program in place to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to loca"
