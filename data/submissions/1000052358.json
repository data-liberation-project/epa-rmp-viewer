The NAICS code is 311612.  The facility has approximately 500 full time employees and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year. In the correction dated 04/15/2016 we updated the Emergency contact information and reduced the actual inventory almost in half, down to 36,707 pounds. The reason for this reduction is we had Plant Design Services come on site and physically measure all piping and apply engineering calculations to determine our actual inventory. In addition, previously the WCS did not take into account the engineering limitations that are on the vessel, which explains the reduction in the WCS distance.\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis submittal informs all interested parties that this facility is participating in the OSHA Process\n\nSafety Management (PSM) program defined in 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA Risk Management\n\nProgram (RMP) defined in 40 CFR Part 68. These programs provide for the implementation of detailed\n\nprevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP\n\nprograms. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat\n\ntemperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas. Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility. This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequences of analysis was determined utilizing RMP comp and the population data is\n\nbased upon information pu"

How to determine the WCS & ARS was derived from the Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities (May 2004).\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the\n\nsystem, included are: high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.\n\n\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents\n\nassociated with the ammonia refrigeration system. The Fire Department / Hazmat Team will be notified so that they can provide assistance during an incident. If it is necessary to contact the public regarding an\n\nammonia release, the local fire department will be contacted to coordinate with the police department. The police department will notify residents and business locations.\n\n\n\nThis facility had a reportable release September 22, 2015. We had some debris/contamination get into an A4AD valve on the water chiller, causing it not to operate correctly. With this valve not operating correctly the water going across the plates caused the liquid ammonia to boil and change to vapor which expanded and could not relieve through the A4AD and the SRV lifted like it was designed to do. It was discovered very quickly and isolated. However, some debris prevented the SRV from reseating properly so it continued to weep past until we switched the valve over to the other SRV. In lieu of repairing and re-piping the water chiller we have taken it out of service and removed it from the system.  \n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews,\n\nMechanical Integrity inspections, Preventative Maintenance activity, equipment inspections, and training to ensure mitigation and control of potential incidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility will make chang"
