In this resubmission, SELC is removing the chemical chlorine from the RMP.  The facility uses liquid chlorine - which is not a RMP regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nSELC has an ongoing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.  SELC has emergency response policies in place that are adressed in the facility's Heath and Safety Policies, SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan.  Most of the listed Plans have a minimum of annual training requirements to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  New employees are required to read the Plans listed above and undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.  SELC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nSELC is located in Sioux Center, Sioux County, Iowa.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture, natural gasoline (denaturant).  \n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia - Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in a 12,000 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the "

A determination spreadsheet is included as part of this documentation detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are also provided as part of this documentation.  The ammonia tank sits on concrete saddles. Passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes; the typical chain link fence used to enclose the ammonia tank would not prevent migration of a release.  Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a 100,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation.  The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 560,000 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, equaling 560,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 190,400 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112 (r).   RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation.   Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternate Scenarios:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 10,000 "

The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation.  Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate case release of ammonia.  \n\n\n\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tanker contents, equaling 42,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 14,280 pounds was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112 (r).  Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate case release of denaturant.\n\n  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION"
