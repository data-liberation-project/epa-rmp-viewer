Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe centerpiece of Sunoco's accidental release prevention program is Process Safety Management (PSM).  Sunoco has implemented a management system for PSM, which assigns responsibilities to specific individuals. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM, which are outlined below, constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n     1. Employee Participation\n\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety system that has an our attitude. Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process v"

PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our PSM program. \n\n     3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHA's are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n     4. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. \n\n     5. Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of"

Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n     6. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI activities are trained on the procedures and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n     7. Management of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes.

Pre-startup Safety Review\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams as a final check to ensure the safety of new or modified process facilities before they are placed in service. The review confirms items such as: construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; PHAs have been performed on new processes and all recommendations have been resolved; PSI documentation has been properly updated; MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes; and training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees.\n\n      9. Compliance Audits\n\nThe refinery Process Safety Coordinator is responsible to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the PSM system are being followed. A formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by a corporate audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that PSM and RMP practices are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the PSM/RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Refinery management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\n\n     10. Incident Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recurring.  The investigation team then recommends and implements additiona"

The published reports are shared with employees and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Sunoco organization.\n\n     11. Hot Work Permit\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near a PSM-covered process unit. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process. The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n     12. Contractors\n\nContractors are employed to supplement the refinery's work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. A contractor screening procedure is used to help ensure that contractors are hired who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees, the public, or the environment.  Safety regulations are sent with all bid packages, and an evaluation of the contractor safety record and training program is used in selecting a contracting company.  The safety regulations require contractors to train their employees in the safe work practices and safety rules of the refinery. The program also includes a refinery overview video that is shown to all contractor employees to familiarize them with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working.\n\n     13.

Trade Secrets\n\nOSHA PSM requires the refinery to make available all information necessary to those persons responsible for compiling the process safety information, those assisting in the development of the process hazards analysis, those responsible for developing operating procedures and those involved in incident investigations, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits, without regard to possible trade secret status of such information. Our facility openly provides this necessary information to all responsible persons to comply with these requirements.\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had five accidents resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. The accidents are deemed RMP-reportable because the releases resulted in onsite personnel injuries that required medical treatment, resulted in significant property damage onsite or resulted in property damage offsite.  No offsite injuries occurred due to these incidents. For each of these incidents, we have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the events and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The following is a brief summary of these incidents and the investigation results.\n\nOn April 4, 2003, while removing a blind from a feed line (which was thought to be empty) to a propane bullet, a mechanic experienced a burn to his thigh when liquid propane was discharged.  The incident investigation showed the cause of the release was a leaking inlet valve that had leaked propane downstream of the valve to the area of the blind.   After this incident, all leaking inlet valves to the propane bullets were replaced and a new valve was installed to give the option to safely isolate the feed lines to the propane bullets in the future.  Also, investigation results, as well as safe work practices when working on jobs with multiple lines, were reviewed with operations and maintenance personnel.\n\nOn January 18, 2003, low fuel gas pressure caused the flame in a heater to blow out.

No employees or contractors were injured during the event.  The incident investigation revealed the fuel gas controller was poorly winterized, no operating procedures existed to address the specific situation encountered, and that refinery safety standards had not been followed.  Following the investigation, all refinery operating procedures were reviewed to ensure that all units with heaters had emergency procedures to cover this situation, all emergency shutoff valve bypasses were car sealed closed (per company safety standards), and a standard winterization checklist was developed for all operating areas (which included likely and repetitive freeze up spots).\n \nOn December 23, 2000, a seal balance line on a hydrogen compressor became dislodged releasing a mixture of hydrogen and light hydrocarbons that resulted in an explosion and fire, causing significant onsite property damage.  No employees or contractors were injuried during the event. The incident investigation showed the cause of the release was an improperly installed fitting and subsequent inadequate maintenance activities and procedures that resulted in a compressor fitting failure, causing the seal balance line to become dislodged.  Following the investigation, refinery maintenance procedures were updated to include installation and inspection of compressor fittings, maintenance training was updated, and an audit was completed of all refinery compressors to identify and correct similar situations. \n\nOn June 30, 2000, piping between two exchangers failed releasing a combination of hydrogen and hydrocarbon vapor that resulted in a vapor-cloud explosion and fire, causing significant onsite property damage as well as offsite property damage.  No employees or contractors were injured during the event. The incident investigation showed the cause of the relea"

Since the investigation, all similar piping in the process has been replaced with piping of a different metallurgy that is resistant to degradation in High Temperature Hydrogen service.  Additional safeguards put in place include installing temperature indicators to improve monitoring of the exchangers, modification to operating procedures, and retraining operators on the purpose of the exchangers.  Lastly, a review of all process piping in the refinery in High Temperature Hydrogen service was performed to ensure the correct metallurgy is being used.\n\nOn February 2, 2000, operators were attempting remove a gate valve in Hydrofluoric Acid / Hydrocarbon service, after the system, which the valve was a part of, was purged.  As operators attempted to place the valve in the open position prior to removing it, material sprayed out of the valve and came into contact with an operator's face.  The operator was immediately treated and sent to the hospital where he was admitted overnight for observation.  The incident investigation revealed the material had been trapped under the seat of the valve or in the valve body due to scale formation around the valve stem.  As a result of the investigation, this valve and other valves in similar service were replaced with a Durco type plug valves, operators were trained in the inherent-risk associated with gate valves and the good operating practices that should be used when opening them, and refinery safety standards were revised to upgrade the Personal Protective Equipment utilized on the Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Unit.\n\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe Refinery maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Sara Title III and the Refinery Emergency Response Plan.

Our Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Contained in the Plan are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the refinery.  These emergencies include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel rescue incidents and medical emergencies.  The Plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including:\n \n* Information on the plant emergency organization (Incident Command System)\n* Information on the roles and responsibilities of personnel responding to the incident\n* Procedures for notifying employees that a release has occurred\n* Procedures for plant evacuation and accounting of personnel\n* Procedures to notify local emergency response organizations and other appropriate authorities that a release has occurred\n* Guidance on proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures\n* Procedures for post incident cleanup and decontamination\n \nSeveral methods are available to report an emergency in the refinery including telephones, fire pull boxes and radios.  When an emergency call is received by telephone or radio, the dispatcher at Security Headquarters has the ability to activate alarms that signal various refinery personnel to take action.  An alarm received by fire pull box is a general area alarm and first responders normally communicate by radio the details of the emergency upon arrival on the scene.  The level of response to the emergency is then adjusted as appropriate to the incident.  The dispatcher at Security Headquarters has the ability to pick up a direct dial telephone with the City of Philadelphia Fire Department to request assistance or advise on the status of an emerg"

The Fire Department and the Police Department would use this information to make decisions on advising the public to evacuate or shelter in place.\n\nA vitally important part of the plant emergency organization is the Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The ERT is made up of full-time emergency response employees, as well as employee volunteers from various refinery departments.  The ERT provides the personnel resources for a rapid and effective emergency response.  While most refinery employees receive an incipient responder level of emergency response training, ERT members train and drill on a monthly basis.  Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced interior and exterior fire fighting techniques, hazardous material response, confined space and high angle rescue, emergency medical response, the Emergency Response Plan and implementation of the Incident Command System.  \n\nThe refinery also maintains its own dedicated emergency response equipment.  This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, breathing apparatus, encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, spill response boats and fire fighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and fire fighting foam.  An inspection, testing and maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment.  Examples of equipment and systems included in the program are as follows:\n\n* Fire extinguishers - Inspected monthly and receive annual maintenance per the fire code,\n* Class A chemical suits - Inspected before and after each use, pressure tested quarterly (or more frequently if required),\n* Fire hoses - Inspected and pressure tested each year per the fire code,\n* Stationary fire water pumps - Inspected weekly and performance tested each year per the fire code,\n* Fire apparatus - Inspected weekly and performance tested each year,\n* Water spray systems - Inspected and flow tested annually pe"

Tours and drills with members of these emergency response organizations are held routinely.  These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the refinery.\n\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe are continually striving to make the Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery a safe workplace for our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Our focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations, and proactive management of these issues.  For example, we revalidate the Process Hazard Analyses for approximately six (6) process units each year.  These analyses generate additional prevention and mitigation recommendations that result in ongoing modifications to the facility.  In addition to the Process Hazard Analyses recommendations, the following list of improvements is being planned to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n* Construction of a new Central Control Room\n* Upgrades to emergency response apparatus and other fire protection systems\n* Installation of emergency isolation valves on LPG storage vessels\n* Installation of additional high level alarms on LPG storage vessels \n* Installation of additional water deluge systems \n* Improvements to instrumentation and computer systems\n* Fire water infrastructure upgrades\n* Structural steel fireproofing upgrades\n\nThe goal of the Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery is to demonstrate continuous improvement in our health, environmental and safety performance.  In addition, we will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns.  Should there be any question or c"
