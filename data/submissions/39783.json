As required under US-EPA 40 CFR 68.155, it outlines the following aspects of Accidental Release Prevention at our facility:\n  \n  68.155(a):The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n  68.155(b):The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n  68.155(c):The worst-case release scenarios and the\nalternative release scenarios for each regulated toxic and flammable material subject to regulation;\n \n  68.155(d):The general accidental release prevention\nprogram and chemical-specific prevention steps\n  68.155(e):The five-year site accident history\n  68.155(f): The Emergency Response Program\n  68.155(g):Planned changes to improve safety\n\n40 CFR 68.155(a): Site Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAGC Chemicals Americas, Inc.  (\"AGC-Bayonne\") has implemented an Accidental Release Prevention Program which includes Process Safety Information according to a documentation plan.\n\nProcess Hazard analyses are conducted on a five-year schedule by a process hazard analysis team, using checklist and/or HAZOP techniques.  The team is composed of a Hazard Study Team Leader, Process Supervisors, Process Operators, Maintenance Personnel and other personnel familiar with site production and safety.  Results of these Hazard Analyses have been recorded on the Hazard Studiy proformas.  Recommendations resulting from these hazard studies are recorded, assigned to specific personnel and tracked by the Process Safety Supervisor. The functions of the Process Safety Supervisor may be carried out by the Manager or the Vice President of Environment, Health and Safety.           \n\nOperating Procedures are written by process supervisors, operators and others with input from all affected parties. These Operating Procedures are reviewed by representatives of Site Management; Site Production Managemen"

Input from the Safety, Health and Environment (S/H/E) Department is included as necessary. The S/H/E Department conducts an audit of the SOP as part of the annual TCPA compliance audit.\n \nOperating procedures are maintained and are available on local computer networks on a read-only basis.  Any changes to Operating Procedures must be reviewed by the above noted departments and go through an approval process before adoption onto the site's computer network.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b) Site Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAGC-Bayonne occupies approximately 34.5 acres in the Constable Hook area of the city of Bayonne, NJ, a heavily industrialized area bordered on three sides by Upper New York Bay to the East, Newark Bay to the West and Kill Van Kull Waterway to the South. The site employs about 129 full-time staff and a part-time employee.  The site produces two products. One is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), an adhesion-resistant plastic used in numerous consumer and industrial applications whose trade name is Fluon, the other is HCFC 225 - a specialty cleaning solvent whose trade name is Asahiklin AK-225.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at the site are approximately twenty thousand pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS # 7664-41-7  which is used as a refrigerant gas in the site's refrigeration and chiller system; forty thousand pounds of Tetrafluoroethylene, CAS # 000116-14-3, a raw material which is polymerized to form PTFE; and thirty seven thousand pounds of ammonia contained in 27.5% by weight of aqua ammonia, CAS # 7664-41-7 which is utilized in the plant's Wastewater Treatment system.\n\n40 CFR 68.155 (c): Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nD E L E T E D\n\n40 CFR 66.155(d): Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nRelease prevention steps at the site include relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff systems"

This retraining is encompassed within the site's Operator Training program.\n\nAll release prevention, mitigation and area sniffer systems are subject to the site's Preventive Maintenance program. Equipment reliability information is used in scheduling routine inspections and tests  of these systems to ensure their uninterrupted operation.\n\nThe site's Management of Change program is monitored by the AGC Safety, Health and Environmental Department and ensures that equipment, process or software changes are not made without the direct input of all affected individuals.  All changes are screened by the SHE Department to determine if further hazard studies are required for a particular change.  No changes are made which do not conform to company standards for safe design and operation.\n\nAll incidents are investigated to determine root cause and identify any potential system deficiencies requiring correction.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(e) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe company experienced one incident involving a regulated substance, tetrafluoroethylene (TFE).  The incident involved a small release (5.1 lbs) of 56% TFE from a pressure gauge due to the gauge failure and its inadequacy. There was no injury. There was also no offsite or onsite impact.

The plan defines the structure of AGC-Bayonne's on-site response team, its coordination with the local emergency response agencies such as the Bayonne OEM or LEPC which is\nmanaged by the Bayonne Fire Department, equipment inventories and locations on site, response procedures, site emergency notification procedures, and emergency response drills.  The FEPP is updated as necessary based on results of emergency response drills, response team staffing, or other detail changes.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(g)    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWhile current site control and safety systems reflect the \"state of the art\" for design, it is recognized that safety improvement is a continuing process.  To this end, AGC-Bayonne actively maintains a Behavior-Based safety Management program known as \"SABRE\".  Other changes include those items resulting from the hazard study revalidations, conducted in May 2003 and May 2004."
