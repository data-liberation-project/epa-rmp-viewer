      "SummaryText": "JASPER WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Jasper Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is the sole sewage treatment plant for the city of Jasper, Alabama and surrounding areas. It treats approximately five million gallons of sewage per day. The final treatment operation in the plant involves injection of chlorine into the treated wastewater to kill potentially harmful pathogens. This is followed by injection of sulfur dioxide to destroy the residual chlorine in the final discharge. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only two regulated substances at the site.\n\nChlorine used for this disinfection is stored as a liquid under pressure in one-ton cylinders. The cylinders are stored in a concrete cinder block and steel building. When connected to the process, chlorine is withdrawn from a cylinder using a slight vacuum, and it is immediately dissolved into a small stream of potable water. This chlorine water is then mixed with the entire wastewater flow in a contact chamber where the chlorine reacts to kill pathogenic organisms such as e. coli. The WWTP may have as many as six one-ton cylinders of chlorine on site at any one time.\n\nA residual amount of chlorine in the water will remain after the disinfection reaction is complete. This residual must be removed to meet permitted chlorine discharge limit. Sulfur dioxide is added to dechlorinate the wastewater. The procedure is similar to the chlorine injection procedure. \n\nSulfur dioxide is stored as a pressurized liquid in one-ton cylinders. When connected to the process, sulfur dioxide is withdrawn from the cylinder with a slight vacuum and dissolved in potable water. This sulfur dioxide solution is then mixed with the entire wastewater flow. The sulfur dioxide reacts with residual chlorine to produce dissolved chloride salts. The WWTP may have as many as five sulfur dioxide cylinders on site at any one time.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Jasper Wat"

      "SummaryText": "erworks and Sewer Board (JWWSB) is committed to completely preventing harmful releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. While there is no written policy to that effect, the actions of JWWSB management in providing regular training, and providing routine contracted maintenance of all elements of the gas systems proves that commitment.\n\nThe JWWSB is also committed to incorporating industry-standard good practice into its emergency response practices for the WWTP. The model being used for the update is an industry standard prepared by the Chlorine Institute. When fully implemented, the program will provide the best practical measures to protect the community from large-scale releases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe first element of the accidental release program involves the design and construction of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. Chlorine Institute standards and good engineering practice were used in designing the chlorine system. The sulfur dioxide system was designed and constructed following the recommendations in the Compressed Gas Association's manual on Sulfur Dioxide.\n\nAnother important element of the plant's accidental release prevention program is maintenance of gas systems. Silver Sales, which is a regional supplier of operating and maintenance services for gas storage and injection equipment, currently provides twice-yearly review of the gas systems. They test the critical components and maintain all the equipment in good working condition. The plant, through Silver Sales, currently replaces all the gaseous tubing in the system twice per year and replaces the rigid gas piping once per year. Silver Sales also keeps plant personnel updated on newer technologies and equipment being used for the type of gas systems in the WWTP. Dixie Crane inspects the hoists used to lift gas cylinders from the delivery truck and move them into storage positions in the chemical feed building. This inspection is done yearly. If any deficiencies or concerns "

      "SummaryText": "are noted during the inspection, they are immediately addressed.\n\nTraining is the third major element in the plant's release prevention program. Only trained personnel are allowed to perform any activity related to use of chlorine or sulfur dioxide including unloading gas cylinders, connecting cylinders to the process, operating the gas injection processes, or disconnecting empty cylinders for the process. Harcross Chemicals Incorporated, which is the WWTP's supplier of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, provides this training every two to three years. Training consists of eight hours of classroom lecture and hands-on demonstration.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe WWTP experienced one harmful accidental releases of sulfur dioxide on November 23, 2004.  A minor leak was observed at 10:30 AM, and an emergency repair kit was immediately installed on the leaking sulfur dioxide tank, sealing the leak.  Less than 1 lb. leaked from the tank.  The apparent problem was faulty valve packing on the tank, which had been previously noted by the previous user of the tank, but had not been repaired.  Harcross Chemicals was contacted, and an employee (Charles Haddock) was dispatched at 12:30 PM to correct the problem.  In addition, the Jasper Water Works Board Engineer, Bob Norcross, was notified of the occurrence.  At 3:30 PM, Mr. Haddock determined that the cylinder needed to be picked up and replaced by Harcross Chemicals.  The problem was determined to be the fault of Harcross Chemicals, and they picked up the tank the morning of November 24, 2004, replacing it with a fresh cylinder and taking the faulty cylinder offsite.\n\nThe WWTP experienced no harmful accidental releases of chlorine in the five years prior to this update.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe WWTP emergency response plan consists of evacuation of the facility and immediate notification of the Walker County Emergency Management Agency (EMA).  The Walker County EMA serves as the designated emergency responder when there"

There are no changes planned at this time. However, this review and analysis is an ongoing process, so if subsequent deficiencies are identified, physical or procedural changes will be undertaken without delay.\n\n"
