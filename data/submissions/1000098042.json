      "SummaryText": "Cleveland Utilities owns and operates a WWTP in Cleveland, Tennessee.  The plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are classified as extremely hazardous substances, for disinfection and dechlorination.\n\n\n\nSince the plant uses and stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide in excess of 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively, it is subject to federal requirements including preparation of PSM and RMP programs.  Stringent RMP requirements (known as \"Program 3 Level\") apply to Cleveland Utilities because of Tenessee's OSHA jurisdiction.  Cleveland Utilities has developed an emergency plan to provide employees with specific details for emergency operations.  Additionally, in-house procedures are in place for training personnel on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems, mechanical inspection of equipment, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response and action plan.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has an excellent accident and chemical realease prevention program. Stringent unloading, loading, operational and maintenance procedures have been implemented to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas. There has not been an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or sheltering in place at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe Empergency Response Plan has been evaluated to produce the maximum impact in the least amount of time. The facility has coordinated with all local governments and fire departments to provide effective communications and rapid response in an emergency situation. The staff will respond immediately to a release event by taking the following basic actions:\n\n1.Dial 911. Notify the Emergency Management Agency.\n\n2.Evacuate the facilities and the appropriate perimeter area.\n\n\n\nThere are no planned changes as a result of the last safety review."
