Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State (Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Chapter Comm 43) and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility will respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the Beaver Dam Fire Department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a farm cooperative.  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The anhydrous ammonia system consists of two storage tanks.  The facility presently maintainsnurse tanks  for customer use.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the nurse tanks and applicator tanks is approximately 225,000 pounds.  Some of the nurse tanks and applicator tanks are located at the facility on a short-term basis, and may be temporarily transferred to different United Cooperative facilities.  This facility (i.e., the two storage tanks) is loaded by railcar and transport truck and may use railcars, disconnected from the locomotive, at the facility.  The railcars are primarily used during fertilizer manufac"

Several different contractors have been used (and will be used), including Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC of Garden City, Kansas.  The liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in railcars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.   The anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  \n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario have been developed for the facility.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations (Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Chapter Comm 43).  The following sections 1 through 7 briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program for the primary activity at this facility, which is the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia (Program 2).  Sections 8 through 19 briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process (information obtained from the Agriliance LLC Mason City RMP).\n\n\n\n1) Safety Information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.

The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\".  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n\n\n4) Training:  All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training program.  Initial training for new employees consists of on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) years.  The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n\n\n5) Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.

Hot work permits may be issued for general welding/fabrication purposes and electrical work. Welding/fabrication and electrical work is completed by experienced personnel.   \n\n\n\n19) Contractors:  If a contractor is needed to perform work on process equipment, information regarding the safety performance of the contractor is obtained and evaluated.  Before access to process equipment is given to a contractor, the protocol is to inform the contractor about potential hazards associated with the process, entrance and exit control  and emergency response activities.  Additionally, the contractor must act responsibly.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department (Beaver Dam Fire Department) and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response. \n\n \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility."
