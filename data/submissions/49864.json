Our products are used in automotive, medical, electronic, computer, and appliance industries to name a few.  In order to ensure quality products, quality service and quality of life, SABIC-IP continuously invests in safety and environmental protection.\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \nThis Risk Management Plan is part of SABIC-IP's continuing commitment to minimize the potential impact from our facility on our workers, our community neighbors,  and the environment.  It is the stated policy of SABIC-IP to safely manage our site operations.  In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.  The efforts at our Bay St. Louis, MS, facility have been recognized by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), who oversees our programs, as among the best in the nation for worker safety. \nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions regarding this document, or any other aspect of our company, please contact our Community Relations Representative at (228) 466-3047.  \n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nIn order to provide top quality products for our customers, the SABIC-IP Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. facility uses in its manufacturing process some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable. We are committed to comp"

Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, if a major release does occur, our trained on-site emergency response organization will be activated. This organization includes medical and chemical emergency response teams.\nThe outstanding programs at the Bay St. Louis facility have earned the OSHA STAR award, presented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for exemplary safety management.  This is OSHA's highest award for safety performance. \n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe SABIC-IP plant is located in the Port Bienville Industrial Park.  The site is on a 530-acre tract on the northern shores of Lake Borgne, about 3 miles southeast of the town of Pearlington, Mississippi. \nThe Bay St. Louis, MS. plant uses one chemical that is regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  The chemical is Acrylonitrile, a regulated toxic substance.  Acrylonitrile is used as a raw material to manufacture our products. \n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION / CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nSABIC-IP has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM is an integral part of working safely at SABIC-IP facilities.  PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical accident include:\n? Computer-controlled safety systems on our chemical reaction vessels to ensure that any deviations from the "

Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n? Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks to contain a spill;\n? Spill containment around unloading stations to mitigate the impact of a leak;\n? Acrylonitrile barge unloading operations are continuously attended by US Department Of Transportation (DOT) trained operators;\n? Extensive safety information about the processes available to employees;\n? Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions;\n? Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistently safe work-practices;\n? Maintenance programs to ensure ongoing equipment reliability - includes equipment testing and inspection;\n? A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards (this is called \"Management of Change\");\n? Safety pre-qualification for all contractors;\n? Safety reviews prior to startup of our processes; and,\n? Safety permitting procedures that control hazards during special operations such as welding and other maintenance activities. \n  0.5 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n The Bay St. Louis, MS. site has an outstanding record of accident prevention, which demonstrates its commitment to public and worker safety.  Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.  \n EPA requires that all incidents involving regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or significant on-site impacts are reported in this document.  During the previous five-year period, no such incident has occurred at the plant site. \n 0.6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n The Bay St. Louis, MS. site maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, the public, and the environment in the event of a major accidental release.

Our trained emergency, medical and chemical response teams work closely with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in Hancock County.  \n Examples of some of the emergency drills that have been conducted by the SABIC-IP emergency teams are:\n? A simulated barge incident conducted with site medical, emergency, rescue and Hazmat teams; \n? A simulated chemical tanker truck incident at SABIC-IP Bay St. Louis.\n? A simulated chemical/industrial accident with Hancock Medical Center emergency room and chemical emergency response teams.\n? A simulated response to leaking barges in the waterway where equipment was used to contain the chemical.\n\n Ongoing training exercises are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident. \nSABIC-IP personnel have helped develop emergency preparedness plans for Hancock County and surrounding areas.  In addition, they are members of local emergency planning and emergency preparedness groups.  As is consistent with the Hancock County Emergency Plan, SABIC-IP will work through the Hancock County Sheriff's Department to communicate any appropriate actions to be taken by the public in the event of a chemical emergency.\n  0.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSABIC-IP is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. facility.   Some of the specific planned changes aimed at improving safety are:  \n? Continuing development of best management practices under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP); \n? Conduct a third-party audit of our Process Safety Management system;\n? Continue using behavior based safety tools in an effort to reduce human error leading to a workplace injury "
