Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at NORPAC Foods, Inc. are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. \n\nThis commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our personnel are trained to mitigate or control the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Local HazMat Region 13 in Salem Oregon and Marion County Fire District#1 who provides additional emergency response expertise for our facility.\n\n\n\n2.    The stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, which is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 55,000 in all PSM regulated systems in our facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. One process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nNORPAC Foods Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility has impleme"

The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-If Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of every three years. New management team is fully committed and any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, NORPAC Foods Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and start up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the process. \n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nNORPAC Foods Inc. has implemented a comprehensive training program in place to ensure employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Operators are encouraged to take the RETA (Refrigeration Engineers Technicians Association) CARO Certified Assistant Refrigeration Operator exam for new employees with one year of experience and the CIRO Certified Industrial Refrigeration Operator exam with three years of experience on the job. NORPAC's goal is to eventually request all operators to get these certifications as job requirement in order to operate our systems. Also, refresher training will be provided at least annually and more frequently as needed. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: \n\nNORPAC Foods Inc. has implemented and carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to e"
