Copies of the inspection reports are forwarded to the appropriate Manager/Supervisor for review and corrective action. The Vice President of Water Operations and Vice President of Safety and Security conduct follow-up until all deficiencies are corrected. All compliance audits and safety reports are filed in the Compliance Audits section of the RMP.\n\nPlatte West has had no incidents in the last five years, but in the event of an incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine, an incident investigation team will be formed. The team investigates and reports the findings, causes, and recommendations to the President of the Metropolitan Utilities District. All resolutions and corrective actions will be documented and retained for five years.\n\nThe Metropolitan Utilities District operates its chlorine systems based on sound industry practice and has invested in the structures, equipment and people needed to mitigate the risk of potential small or large leaks to the safety and health of the public.

Platte West, along with the Platte South Water Production Facility and Florence Water Production Facility supply drinking water to the City of Omaha and surrounding communities. Liquid chlorine is used at all these facilities for disinfection.  Chlorine is the only chemical at the District that falls under the RMP rule.\n\nPlatte West is located on a 157-acre property on the southwestern edge of the City of Omaha. All chlorine operations are conducted inside the \u0093Chemical Unit\u0094. The Chemical Unit is under the same roof as the main Plant Building but is isolated from the other occupied areas for safety and security purposes.  The unit was designed to safely contain and mitigate leaks. It acts as a passive safety feature with its large enclosed interior space that slows the escape of any leaking gas. There are also active safety systems inside the Chemical Unit that continuously monitor the air. This system will automatically shut down chlorination feed and process systems if it detects a leak, activate alarms to notify staff, and start a scrubber system that removes chlorine gas from the air.\n\nDistrict also has Emergency Response (ER) plans and procedures in place at all our facilities to bring accidental chlorine leaks under control and protect the safety of the public. District management is committed to the safety of the public, our customers, and our employees. Our ER plan includes active response by properly equipped and Hazmat trained employees working along with the local Fire Department Hazmat teams. Safety and training staff support this strong commitment to safety and health.\n\nThe responsibility for implementation of the District's ER Plan and the safe operation of our Chlorine systems rests with the Vice President of Water Operations.
