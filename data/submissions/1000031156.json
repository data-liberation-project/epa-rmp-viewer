If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Tuscola Fire Department and the Douglas County Emergency Management Agency, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Tuscola Fire Department (aero-medical is available through \"Airlife\").  The primary hospital response is provided through Douglas County-Jarman Memorial Hospital.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.  \n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Development & Logistics, LLC Tuscola Terminal is a propane storage and distribution terminal.  The terminal receives propane via a pipeline system, railcar or tanker truck.  The propane is stored on-site in an underground cavern in preparation for tank truck and railcar loading.  Prior to product loading into railcar or tank trucks, ethyl mercaptan odorant is automatically injected into the propane stream.  The Tuscola Terminal is a fully automated facility and is available for continuous loading and unloading by trained and qualified drivers.  The terminal is equipped with multiple security systems and is designed to fail safe.   \n\n\n\nThe Facility's worst case scenario is the complete failure of one single largest vessel filled to 85% capacity (automatic shutoff limited) resulting in a total release of the flammable substance (Propane) and the resulting vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends of"

The resulting distance to endpoint extends off-site and affects public receptors.  \n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Development & Logistics, LLC - Tuscola Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D - Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).  \n\n\n\nThis is a RMP for an existing propane process (acquired from BP, October 2011): there have been no accidents/incidents resulting in a significant release within the previous five (5) years of operations as reported by the Tuscola Terminal personnel and a review of incident records.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Tuscola Terminal propane storage and distribution system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Tuscola Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the Tuscola Fire Department and the Douglas County LEPC.  The Tuscola Fire Department is aware of the Facility's propane system, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the even of a significant release.  The Tuscola Terminal maintains a vegetation control plan to minimize plant growth with 10 feet of the railcar loading/unloading areas.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.  \n\n\n\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety.  Also, Buckeye is considering a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles.   \n\n"
