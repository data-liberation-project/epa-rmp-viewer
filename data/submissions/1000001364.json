      "SummaryText": "ADM - Clinton\nRMP Executive Summary \n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of the Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Corn Processing, Clinton, Iowa to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objectives are to minimize the risk of a Sulfur Dioxide, Ethylene Oxide, or denaturant release, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to ADM's employees, the public and the environment.  These objectives will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, maintaining a preventive maintenance program, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary with the Clinton Fire Department, the local emergency response providers.\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with the Clinton County Emergency Management Agency, which is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Clinton Fire Department.  Emergency response procedures at this facility include notification of the LEPC in the event of an accident involving Sulfur Oxide, Ethylene Oxide or the denaturant with emergency response provided by the Clinton Fire Department with support by the Davenport Fire Department.  \n\nB. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nThe ADM-Clinton facility is a corn wet milling processing plant which processes corn into products such as corn sweeteners, fuel and beverage ethanol, corn oil and dry specialty starches.  To produce these products ADM-Clinton uses numerous substance which includes the substances Sulfur Dioxide, Ethylene Oxide and denaturant (natural gasoline containing n-pentane) that is regulated by the RMP regulations.  Sulfur Dioxide is used as a processing aid for starch and gluten, Ethylene Oxide is used in the production of specialty starches, and the natural gasoline is used as a denaturant in the fuel alcohol.\n\nADM-Clinton"

      "SummaryText": " continues to include denaturant (natural gasoline) as used in the production of fuel ethanol, which as mentioned has the listed chemical pentane in it.  The denaturant used at the facility generally has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of less than 4 and is exempt from the RMP according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2).  However, due to the potential variability in the make-up of this additive, it is possible that ADM will receive material that has a flammability rating of 4.  Therefore, ADM has included provisions in the RMP for managing the denaturant as a precautionary measure.  \n\nC. Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Scenario for Toxic Chemicals:\n\nFor multiple toxic substances the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated and reported for the toxic substance estimated to create the greatest distance, in any direction, to an endpoint.  To determine a worst-case scenario for toxics, it is assumed that the entire contents of the single largest tank fails catastrophically and is released over a ten minute period.  Assumed worst-case weather conditions include 1.5 m/s wind speed and a class F atmospheric stability.  The EPA regulations also require a worst-case scenario to be evaluated and reported for other toxics which may affect a different group of receptors other than the original group and an alternative more-likely scenario evaluated and reported for each toxic chemical.  \n\nEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis - March 2009 was used as a screening tool to determine the worst-case scenario(s) for this facility.  This evaluation was used to evaluate the consequences of a worst-case release of the toxics present, Sulfur Dioxide and Ethylene Oxide, to determine the extent of the effect on the receptors.    \n\nAlternative Scenario #1 for Toxic Chemicals: \n\nAs previously mentioned, an alternative or more realistic release scenario involving each toxic chemical resulting in an off-site "

EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis-2009 was used to perform the required OCA for this facility.  \n\nAlternative Scenario #2 for Toxic Chemicals:\n\nAccidental release of Ethylene Oxide might occur due to a release from a 4-inch pipe resulting from a piping failure at a flange, joint, weld or seal.  EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis-2009 was used to perform the required OCA for this facility. \n\nWorst-case Scenario for Flammable Chemicals:\n\nFor flammable substances subject to Program 3 requirements, the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated and reported.  The worst-case scenario for substances that are normally liquid at ambient temperatures assumes that the single largest container fails catastrophically, the entire contents are released instantaneously and forms a pool.  It is assumed that the amount which vaporizes in the first ten minutes is involved in a vapor cloud explosion.  EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis-2009 was used to perform the required offsite consequences analysis (OCA). \n\nThe worst-case flammable scenario is complete loss of the 4,000,000 gallon denatured tank containing 95% ethanol, 5% gasoline (which is 51% n-pentane). \n\nAlternative Scenario #1 for Flammable Chemicals:\n\nAccidental release of fuel (consisting of 51% n-pentane) from the 36,000 gallon gasoline tank might occur due to a release from a 4-inch hole resulting from a piping failure at a flange, joint, weld or seal.  EPAA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis-2009 was use to perform the required OCA for this facility.\n\nTo determine the most extenuating impact from an alternative release a number of factors were evaluated.

Accidental Release Prevention:\n\nThe key concepts in this facilityA?s prevention program are the elements of OSHAA?s PSM Program which include Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, and Contractors.\n\nE.

Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Program and Emergency Response Plan for responding to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  As part of this program, ADM has personnel trained to the First Responder Awareness Level who can identify the released materials and activate the Plant Emergency Operations Plan, and First Responder Operations Level who can isolate the spill area, control access to the areas, and initiate containment activities under the direction of the Operations Officer.  Hazardous Waste clean-up activities are handled primarily by spill contractors.\n\nClinton County has a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which has developed a county-wide emergency response plan that involves local industry, the fire departments, police departments, ambulance services, hospitals, the health department, the county highway department, local streets and sanitation department, and other local government agencies.  The plan organizes county-wide response to emergencies.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of a safety review of this facilityA?s Liquid Sulfur Dioxide, Ethylene Oxide and fuel alcohol systems it has been determined that no changes are required to be made to the systems at this time.
