Full scale emergency response to actual scenarios will be practiced on a quarterly basis.  Monthly meetings are scheduled for the emergency response team to review the needs and objectives of the team.  Annual re-certification will be provided as required by OSHA.

Minimal amounts of chlorine gas in the atmosphere will trigger on-site alarms and provide notification.  District personnel also receive specific training in the handling of chlorine cylinders and apparatus and in emergency repair.  Only the necessary amount of chlorine required for use in the treatment processes is stored at the wastewater facilities to minimize the potential hazards.\n                      \nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe District has experienced no accidental release of chlorine gas during the last five years and , in fact, has not experienced any accidental releases since it began using chlorine in 1972.\n\n                  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe District has developed and trained an emergency response team that is qualified to respond to and make repairs necessary to stop an accidental release of chlorine gas.  Other District employees have also been trained in the first responder, awareness level and first responder, operations level response to accidental releases of chlorine.

The facility is considered a secondary treatment facility and includes processes of primary clarification, biological treatment, secondary clarification, filtration and disinfection.  Chlorine gas is injected into the treated wastewater to kill any potential disease causing organisms.  Up to eight cylinders containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas each are stored at this facility.\n\n                     Worst Case Scenario\n\nA worst-case release scenario at the wastewater treatment facility would involve major damage to a valve incurred while loading or offloading chlorine gas cylinders.  This could result in a release of chlorine gas from the container at a rate of 200 lbs. per minute with the release lasting ten minutes.  At this release rate, toxic gas could extend over a distance of 1.3 miles.  The affected area would involve a maximum of 13,210 people and would include residential areas, industrial area, commercial area, hospital, and elementary, middle, high school and college level students.\n\n                Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario at the wastewater treatment facility is similar to that considered for the water treatment facility.  A leak would occur at the valve while the cylinder was being connected into the system.  At a release rate of one pound per minute, toxic gas would extend over a distance of 0.1 miles.  A toxic atmosphere could impact the District operations and administrative offices and could involve 32 people.  Again, it is unlikely that the entire content of a cylinder would be released because personnel would be on hand to immediately respond and stop any leakage.\n\n         Additional Scenario Concerns to the Community\n\n  In addressing the earthquake disaster potential, the one ton containers are cradled on engineered blocks attached to the floor and strapped in place"
