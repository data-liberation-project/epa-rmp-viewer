Safety and Environmental Policies\n\nGreenville Tube Company (GTC) is committed to promoting the overall safety of our employees, the public and surrounding environment. GTC complies with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Plan (RMP) Title 40 CFR Part 68 to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic or flammable substances. These programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety and environmental programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including the use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals or combination of these activities.\n\nOur safety and environmental programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees and contractors at our facility.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nGTC consumes anhydrous ammonia during the manufacture of stainless steel tubing. GTC maintains two tanks (8,000 and 1,000 gallon capacities) and ancillary piping for this purpose. Our Standard Operating Procedures limit the maximum amount of ammonia at this facility to 80% of tank capacity or 37,080 pounds.\n\n3.   Worst Case Scenario\n\nFailure of the large ammonia tank containing 32,960 pounds of ammonia (80% of the vessel capacity) resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.0 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely  for the following reason: wo"

Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nScenario 1\n\nFailure of a Safety Relief Valve where over-pressurization causes the valve to lift and the valve does not reseat properly resulting in a release of 18,540 pounds over a period of 60 minutes. Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. SRV failure was chosen as an alternative release scenario because the high severity rating of such a release. It is unlikely to occur for the following reasons: Preventative Maintenance Procedures, schedules SRV replacements every 5 years; scheduled SRV valve replacements at least every 15 years; and daily checks.\n\nScenario 2\n\nSmall pipe leak in the indoor process piping resulting in a release of 566 pounds over a period of 60 minutes. Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel less than 0.1 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. A small pipe leak was chosen as an alternative scenario because of the use of cranes and hoists to for moving materials from one are of the plant to another. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: All employees are trained on the presence and hazards of ammonia; only certified crane operators are allowed to operate cranes; piping is located outside normal materials handling areas; regular maintenance, inspection and replacement of equipment; and the emergency response plan and eq"

Accidental Release Prevention Plan\n\nGreenville Tube Company complies with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA RMP regulations inn 40 CFR part 68. Our PSM team conducts Process Hazard Analysis and Compliance Audits and Program reviews according to OHSA and EPA standards. Our personnel receive Hazard Communications Training annually and have access to our written safety and environmental programs. The ammonia system is inspected operated and maintained to industry standards. Our ammonia operators receive training in the classroom and on the job. They receive written tests to determine competency as well as testing by demonstration and observation.\n\n6.   Five-year Accident History\n\nTo this date, Greenville Tube Company has not incurred a reportable release.\n\n7.   Emergency Response \n\nGreenville Tube Company?s emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1991.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Clarksville Fire Department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and fire department. \n\n8. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nGreenville Tube Company is installing new Preventative Maintenance Software that will improve maintenance programs plant-wide. GTC is also currently considering the removal of anhydrous ammonia from operations which will eliminate the need for participation in the PSM and RMP programs."
