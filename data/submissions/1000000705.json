      "SummaryText": "Canyon Regional Water Authority is located in Guadalupe County, Texas, in a rural, primarily residential and recreational area.  Canyon Regional Water Authority is located near the City of New Braunfels, Texas.  The water treatment plant is located along the banks of the Guadalupe River, and uses chlorine gas as the primary water disinfectant.\n\nThe entire supply on hand consists of a maximum of twelve(12), one-ton containers.  A vacuum feed / injection system is used to prevent leaks in the system.  A chlorine leak detector is in place with an audible alarm system to alert personnel of chlorine leaks.  There are SCBA units on-site for chlorine emergencies.  The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times a day by an on-site operator and monitored daily on weekends.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly.\n\nA Hazard Assessment has been conducted and documented in accordance with 40 CFR 68.20 - 68.42 and a Prevention Program has been implemented to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.48 A? 68.60.  There have been no accidental chlorine gas releases within the past five years.\n\nCanyon Regional Water Authority has developed an emergency response plan for the Lake Dunlap Water Treatment Plant.  This plan identifies procedures and response actions to be taken in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Guadalupe County EMC and the Lake Dunlap Volunteer Fire Department."
