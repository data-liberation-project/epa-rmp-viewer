If an emergency were to occure, it is our policy to notify the Bancroft Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a farmer owned cooperative.  We sell agricultural products to members and non-members. We sell NH3 for the sole purpose of fertilization of farm ground.  This facility consists of one 18,000 gallon storage tank and one 12,000 gallon storage tank which are plumbed together.  There are also approximately 68 nurse tanks (14 - 1500 gallon and 54 - 1000 gallon).\n\nOur worst case senario would be the sudden release of both tanks at one time when they were filled to capacity.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to endpoint would be 4.4 miles with an appoximate population of 705 people.  Since this facility is located within the city limits of Bancroft, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons.  An avacuation plan is in place.\n\nOur alternate senerio would be the accidental pull-away by a recieving transport unit without disconnecting the transfer hose.  According to the EPA look-up tables, the end point would be .5 miles with an approximate population of 300 people.  All emplyees working at this facility have been trained on how to respond to this type of scenerio.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involoving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage or evacuations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency our NH3 plant, it is our policy to notify the Bancroft Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire depratment and members of the fire department have inspected our NH3 facility.\n\nThere are no planned changes of our porceedures or policies."
