      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nBasell USA Inc - Lake Charles ? Risk Management Plan \nLDEQ Facility ? Agency Interest # 1253\n\nSource & Process Description:\n\nThe Basell Lake Charles facility has one Program 3 covered process described as follows:\n\nPolypropylene: The polypropylene process is operated via Basell?s patented Spheripol technology. The process includes a storage vessel and a pipeline containing the following maximum intended inventories: Propylene Storage ? 934,000 lbs. ; Ethylene Pipeline ? 4031 lbs.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards:\n\nThe worst case flammable scenario has been selected due to potential impact on different public receptors. This worst case scenario includes the release of the entire content of the propylene storage vessel and subsequent vapor cloud explosion with a 1-psi endpoint that would reach a residential population. The alternate case flammable scenario is the release of the entire content of an ethylene pipeline segment and has a 1-psi endpoint that would reach an adjacent industrial complex. The 1-psi endpoint from this alternative flammable release scenario does not reach residential public receptors. There were no worst case toxic release or toxic alternate case scenarios reported since there are no listed toxic chemicals above threshold quantities within the facility. \n\nAccident Prevention:\n\nMost processes at the Basell Lake Charles Plant are covered by 29 CFR 1910.119, the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard that requires each operation be subjected to a detailed Process Hazards Analysis (PHA). As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, Basell is also committed to the Responsible Care Codes of Management Practices. The hazards analyses for all Lake Charles Plant Processes have been completed, and all safety improvements have been implemented. Any changes to the processes (procedures, raw materials, process conditions, etc.) or plant equipment following the PHA must follow the Management of Change (MOC) procedure whereby a tea"

The MOC team will track and document completion requirements, such as procedure revision and operator training, before approving the implementation of the change. All PHA?s are revalidated at least every five years, and the PHA and revalidation documentation is retained for the life of the process. \n\nThe PSM Standard requires that each employee presently involved in operating a process, and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process, be trained in an overview of the process and the operating procedures, including safety, health, emergency operations, shutdown, and safe work practices. At the Lake Charles Plant both classroom and field training accomplish this, and written tests and field observation verify understanding of the training. Maintenance and contract maintenance employees are trained, not only in the craft skills and repair procedures, but also, in the safety and environmental aspects of their job. Refresher training for operators and maintenance personnel is conducted at least every three years and more often if necessary. Training on certain safe work practices (e.g. hot work, confined space entry) is conducted annually.\n\nSafety Design Criteria (SDC), based on Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP), and Basell?s long history of safe operation of our unique technologies world wide, are developed and documented for each process type (e.g. Spheripol Polypropylene, Spherilene Polyethylene). Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted to verify compliance prior to startup. PSSR is also conducted as a step in the MOC process when there is an equipment change or modification.\n\nThe Lake Charles Plant has a formal Mechanical Integrity Management System that defines the frequency and protocol of preventive maintenance which "

The Lake Charles Plant has over 70 atmospheric detectors that alarm if a very low level of chemical release is detected. This gives operating and maintenance personnel early warning of a problem which can be corrected before it presents a hazard to employees or the community. \n\nEmergency Preparedness:  \n\nThe Basell Lake Charles Plant has a written Emergency Reponse Plan which details the responsibilities of employees during emergency situations including fire, explosion, chemical release and process deviations. Each shift has a well-trained Emergency Response Team led by Incident Commanders who are normally the operations Shift Team Leaders. The Emergency Response team members receive annual training at the Lamar University Fire Training Center, and the Incident Commanders receive additional leadership training. The plant has a dedicated emergency phone extension that is used to alert the Plant?s Security Officers that an emergency situation exists. The Security officer then activates the plant alarm system that is coded to identify the location and nature of the emergency. The Emergency Response Team then switches to a dedicated emergency radio channel and responds according to the instructions from the Incident Commander. The Emergency Response Team on each shift participates in a drill once per year. Although the drills are scripted in advance, the response Team members are not informed of the location or nature of the drill. Observers time each step of the response and record the quality of the response. After the drill, the observers and team members meet and critique the drill to allow continuous response improvement.\n\nEmergency Response Team members and other employees who will be expected to respon"

All Lake Charles Plant employees receive regular fire extinguisher and fire hose handling training. \n\nThe Lake Charles Plant has written procedures on emergency preparedness for unusual situations such as hurricanes and bomb threats. Each of the process areas has backup emergency electrical power and instrument air to allow a safe shutdown in the event of an electrical power failure. \n\nBasell is an active participant in Southwest Louisiana Mutual Aid whose mission is ?the joining together of fire fighting, rescue, first aid and law enforcement personnel, and facilities among LA industries and municipalities for mutual assistance in case of emergency situations.? Should the need for additional equipment or resources arise during an emergency, the incident commander can call upon Mutual Aid for assistance. \n\nCommunity Safety:\n\nThrough active participation in the Calcasieu CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) Group and the Calcasieu Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Basell is involved in developing and maintaining the system designed to protect the community in the event of a chemical emergency. A network of sirens is in place to immediately alert the community of a chemical emergency and the need to monitor radio and TV for instructions from the LEPC. Basell also has a telephone ?call down? system which will alert the immediate neighbors of a chemical emergency at the Lake Charles Plant. Lake Charles Plant personnel have helped distribute literature containing instructions on what to do when the siren sounds.

Where the risk assessments indicated reasonable potential for off-site impact, equipment and procedures has been put in place to mitigate that off-site impact.\n\nIncident History:\n\n40 CFR 68.42, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires covered industries to report a five-year accident history in their Risk Management Plan based on the following guidelines: ? all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.? The Basell Lake Charles Plant has had no incidents in the past 5 years, which meet these criteria.\n\nCommunity Outreach:\n\nThe CMA requirements for achieving ?Practice In Place? for the Responsible Care codes of management practice (which Basell achieved in 1997) involve a lot of interaction with the community. Although Responsible Care has certainly increased these activities, Basell Lake Charles has always sought to be a good corporate neighbor. Examples of this are participation in the ?Adopt-A-Road? program since 1992 and the adoption of T.S. Cooley Elementary Magnet School as our Partner In Education in 1988. Working with T.S. Cooley, Basell has provided tutors, judges for science and math fairs, chemistry experiments, financial assistance for field trips and competitions and U.S. Saving Bonds for graduates. At Christmas, the students come to the plant and perform a holiday program for the employees.\n\n\nBasell Plant management is an active participant with the Calcasieu Community Advisory Panel (CCAP).

In addition to scheduled presentations by plant representatives, LEPC members and technical experts (environmental, medical, etc.), the CCAP meetings provide an open forum for community members to question plant management about their concerns relative to plant operations and to provide feedback from the community at large. Basell participates in sponsoring attendance of CCAP members to CMA?s ?Building Communities Together? workshop. The workshop, which was attended by CCAP members and industry representatives from around the country as well as CMA leadership and regulatory officials, was reported to be very informative by CCAP attendees. \n\nPlant History: \n\nBeginning in1959 the Lake Charles facility was owned and operated by Hercules Incorporated; in 1983 Hercules merged their polypropylene business with the polypropylene business of Montedison S.p.A of Milan, Italy to form Himont; in 1995 Montell was formed through a merger of the majority of the polyolefins interest of Royal Dutch / Shell Group of Companies with those of Montedison S.p.A. including Himont Incorporated. In 1997 Shell acquired the Montedison 50% interest in Montell Polyolefins. In October of 2000 Shell then merged with BASF to form the present Basell Polyolefins, a 50 /50 joint venture company.\n\nThe Lake Charles plant is one of Basell?s largest sites in North America with over 185 full time employees. The Plant now occupies 285 acres of land on the corner of Highway 108 and Bayou d?Inde Road with an annual production of 1 billion pounds. \n\n\nProduct Information:\n\nBasell Polyolefins is a worldwide organization dedicated to the development, manufacturing and marketing of a diverse range of polyolefins. Olefins are hydrocarbon byproducts of oil refining such as propylene and ethylene. When propylene or ethylene undergo a process called catalytic polymerization, polypropylene or polyethylene, commonly called plastic, are formed. At the Lake Charle"
