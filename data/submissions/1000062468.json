(XTO) has a strong commitment to the protection of workers and the environment.  The Site has an active safety program covering both employees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to prevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. XTO recognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including personnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of all operating units and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment is also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to provide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is present at the Site to contain any liquid spills that may occur. The NGL storage tank was chosen as the WCS scenario as it is the only storage tank.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Oak Hill Site (the Site) is located at the end of an approximately 0.6-mile lease road south of Farm-to-Market (FM) 850, approximately 2 miles southwest of the intersection of FM 850 and U.S. Highway 259 in Rusk County, Texas. The Site neither uses nor stores any regulated toxic substance above RMP threshold quantities (40 CFR ? 68.130). Inherent with the operation of a gas processing Site, the Site processes and stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. These flammable substances are addressed throughout the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and may incl"

XTO Energy maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the Site's processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Employees at the Site are active in the development and maintenance of up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known concerns. For specific operations areas, the Site has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters, such as temperature, level, and composition. The Site ensures that each process is maintained within approved limits using process controls and monitoring instruments,trained personnel, and protective instrument systems, such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe Site also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. The Site's operational status is inspected daily. Identified issues are reported to"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the Site.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Site has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n?Release containment and control\n\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the operayion (manual and automated)\n\n-    Automated bypasses and manual shutoffs for specific process parameters\n\n-    Pressure relief valves are properly sized and tested every 3 years.  Any such valve that fails a test will be replaced or repaired and tested annually until reliability is ensured.\n\n-    Baseline ultrasonic testing thickness testing (for pipe corrosion) will be performed prior to startup.\n\n-    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters\n\n-    Diking to contain liquid releases\n\n-    Atmospheric relief devices\n\n?Release mitigation\n\n-    Fire suppression and extinguishing devices \n\n-    The local fire department has been notified about the potential hazards of the Site and has been provided the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Site has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel by use of locks held by qualified contractors and employees, (2) a lockout/tagout guidelines to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a guideline for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and guideline to control spark-producing activities, such as hot work, and (5) a permit and guideline to ensure that adequate pre"

These, and many other guidelines, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this report, the Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases, with no RMP-reportable incidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Site is coordinated with the Rusk County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings, which include local emergency response officials, and local government officials. The Site contacts local emergency responders annually with regard to the hazards of regulated substances at the Site. Annual Tier II Chemical Inventory filings are provided to the LEPC which detail the hazardous chemicals at the Site.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nNo changes are currently needed for the Site. In the event a change is identified that would improve safety, that change will be implemented upon management approval and directive. The Site will provide training, share information regarding hazards, and coordinate operating practices to simplify operations and ensure safety.\n\n"
