It is operated by ECO\nResources, which is subject to the requirements of OSHA 1910.120.  Therefore, this is a\nProgram 3 Risk Management Plan submittal. It is the policy of the MUD and ECO resources\nto fully comply with OSHA and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations\nregarding the storage and use of hazardous materials.\n\n0.2    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n0.2.1    Stationary Source Description\n\nThis source is a 2.6 million gallons per day municipal utility district water treatment (water\nsupply) plant that provides potable water for the River Place Subdivision.  One of the\ncomponents of the treatment plant is disinfection of the water by chlorination.  This site is\nlocated in an area  where the terrain consists of relatively steep hills.\n\n0.2.2    Regulated Substances\n\nTh only regulated substance present at this facility is chlorine gas, which is delivered in one\nton cylinders.\n\n0.3     Release Scenarios\n\n0.3.1    Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for this site is the rapid loss (complete loss over a ten-minute\nperiod) of a full 2,000-pound chlorine cylinder.  The distance to the endpoint for this\nscenario is 1.3 miles.  A 1.3-mile radius around this site encompasses 876 homes and\napartments, including existing structures, structures under construction and planned structures\nunder development (estimated population 2,600); recreation area (park and golf course); and\na designated wildlife refuge.\n\n0.3.2    Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes a full leak at the 3/4 inch cylinder vapor connection.\nThis scenario generates a chlorine gas release rate of 86 pounds (of chlorine) per minute.  The\npredicted distance to the endpoint is 0.2 miles. Public and environmental receptors within this\ndistance include 12 planned homes (none of whi"

If the vacuum is\nbroken (due to a line break or leak), the valve at the chlorine storage cylinder automatically\ncloses to prevent a release.  There are chlorine gas monitors near the chlorine gas system that\nprovide direct chlorine readings at the site and sound alarms at the ECO Resources (operator)\nbuilding.  ECO Resources has emergency equipment and a leak repair kit.  A SCBA is kept at\nthe facility for use by personnel responding to a leak.  There are emergency procedures in\nplace for repairing leaks and for notification of local authorities and emergency response\nteams. Routine and preventive maintenance is performed on the chlorine system.\n\n0.4    Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases at this site over the past five years (or ever) that have\nresulted in any injuries or property damage.\n\n0.5    Emergency Response Program\n\nUpon discovery of a leak by an employee or local resident report or via the chlorine gas\nmonitor/alarm system, ECO Resources notifies the local chlorine response team and the\nfacility operator.  On-site response time is 30 minutes or less.  If the response team determines\nthat 10 pounds of chlorine have been released, or if there is a potential health or off-site\nhealth threat, the proper authorities are notified immediately.  These include the Travis\nCounty Office of Emergency Management, City of Austin Office of Emergency Management,\nthe NRC, the TNRCC and, if necessary, 911 for fire and police assistance.  The response\nteam will also take immediate steps to shutdown the system and stop/repair the source of the\nrelease.\n\n0.6    Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes to improve the safety of this site are currently pending or being implemented.\nThere are no recommended changes at this time."
