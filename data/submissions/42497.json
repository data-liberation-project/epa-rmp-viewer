As our most valuable asset, we place top priority in the informing, educating, protecting and preserving our employees as valuable members of the company.\n\nAmerican Foods Group's primary focus is to prevent the occurrence of an unforeseen incident/accident from occuring in the work environment.\n\nFacility Descriptions and Regulated Substance\n\nThe operations at the facility consists of the processing of beef and speciality meat cuts.  The facility employs approximately 1500 employees on 3 shifts.  The refrigeration system at the facility comprises our process with the regulated substance being anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  This is a self contained system which provides the refrigeration for the Green Bay Dressed Beef facility.\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System Description\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single stage, closed loop system that is used to provide cooling for the process rooms, temperature control, water chilling, temper water for sanitation and freezer storage.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one release of NH3 on 3/29/00.  Please see section 6 for details.\n\nTo accomplish the facility's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a multi-faceted safety program.  The objectives of the safety program are to achieve maximum effiency and safety performance.\n\nThe facility has implemented a prevention program for the accidental release of the NH3 process.  Elements of the program coincide with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard(PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119; EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation (RMP), 40 CFR Part 68; State of Wisconsin's Ref Code: Chapter 45, NH3 Refrigeration and LP Gas Inspection Report.  The purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent occurrences and minimize the consequences of significant release"
