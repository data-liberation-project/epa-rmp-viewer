This commitment is demonstrated by The City's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at its facility. It is The City's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur unforeseeably, The City is completely coordinated with the Angleton Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility's primary activities encompass wastewater treatment. The City has one regulated substance present at its facility that exceeds the regulated quantity. This substance is chlorine and is used for disinfection of the wastewater. The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 4,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe City has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements mandated under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at The City's stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe City maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\t\r\nThe City conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with its processes are ide"

The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within its covered processes, The City has adopted written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown. The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe City has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Training is provided as frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe City carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel who have previous training in maintenance practices, and are offered further specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nProcedures are in place at The City to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose jobs tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Reviews\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established process are conducted at The City. These reviews are conduc"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe City believes process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, The City's employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nOn occasion, The City hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. The facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\n4.\tFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe City has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Due to the facility's stringent release-prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe City is coordinated to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.
