Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nThe F. B. Purnell Sausage Co., Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Shelby County Department of Emergency Services, who provides our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 45,081 pounds.\r\n\r\n3., I\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPA's EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.
