      "SummaryText": "Transok / Clinton Gas Plant RMP / Executive Summary\n\n\nA.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Clinton Gas Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Transok's policy for the design and operation of gas plants is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to and attempt to control and contain the release.\n\n\nB.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nTransok operates the Clinton Gas Plant located 6 miles east of Clinton, Oklahoma and 1.5 miles south of Interstate 40 in Custer County.  The Clinton Plant receives natural gas with some condensed hydrocarbon liquids (i.e. condensate) from production wells by pipeline system.  The plant separates ethane, propane, butanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components from natural gas by liquefying them at cryogenic temperatures. The natural gas minus these liquefied components (called \"residue gas\") is delivered back into the pipeline system for ultimate use as fuel.  The natural gas liquids (NGL's or Raw Mix) are sold separately for petrochemical feedstock, fuel, and other uses.  The NGL's are delivered into a Koch Company pipeline connected to the plant.\n\nThe Clinton Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Transok identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Section II - Accident Release Prevention Program, Table 1.  \n\nListed flammable substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the Clinton Gas Plant, are NGL's (prod"

      "SummaryText": "uct), methane and condensate.  However, Transok has determined that condensate has an NFPA rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  There are no listed toxic substances stored above threshold quantities at the Clinton Plant.\n\nBased on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint does not exceed the distance to public receptors.   In addition, the Clinton Gas Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Therefore, the Clinton Gas Plant is classified as a Program 1 process under the Accident Release Program\n\n\n\nC.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n1.\tWorst-Case Releases\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case scenario (WCS) release of a flammable substance is a 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is from one of the NGL storage tanks (i.e. product surge tank) with an endpoint 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.40 miles.  This is based on using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) equations found in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" dated May 24, 1996.   The storage capacity of the largest NGL storage tank is 40,000 gallons, which is limited to 80% or 32,000 gallons by administrative controls.  It assumes the entire contents of the tank (32,000 gallons or 125,840 pounds) is released instantaneously and is involved in the vapor cloud explosion.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Clinton Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above the"

Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for NGL's as follows:  \n\nA 2 inch valve on the 40,000 gallon, 250 psi, product surge tank fails and releases contents undetected for a period of 30 minutes.  This volume released of 30,785 pounds then participates in a vapor cloud explosion resulting in a 1 psi overpressure endpoint distance of 0.25 miles. This is based on EPA equations found in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" document. \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Clinton Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of each regulated toxic substance is not required.\n\n\nD.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Clinton Gas Plant. The processes at the gas plant are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  They are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Release Prevention (APR) Program under EPA's RMP.\n\n1.\tEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Clinton Gas"

Employee involvement will help ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. In addition, this is mandated as part of Transok Corporate Policy #SA4 - Employee Participation and is further identified in Section II, Part C of the PSM Manual.\n\nThe Clinton Gas Plant strongly encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of this include a cross-section of employees and management ad hoc teams participating in:\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis \n* Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n* Audits\n* Operating Procedures Development\n\nThe Clinton Gas Plant also actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at monthly safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employee suggestions on improving safety processes are encouraged at these meetings. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are also documented in Section II, Part C of the PSM Manual.\n\n2.\tProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in caring out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.  See also Section II, Part F of the PSM Manual.\n\n\n\n5.\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Clinton Gas Plant has various training programs available for operations personnel.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  New operators are also paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

      "SummaryText": "Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nTransok operates the Clinton Gas Plant located 6 miles east of Clinton, Oklahoma and 1.5 miles south of Interstate 40 in Custer County.  The Clinton Plant receives natural gas with some condensed hydrocarbon liquids (i.e. condensate) from production wells by pipeline system.  The plant separates ethane, propane, butanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components from natural gas by liquefying them at cryogenic temperatures. The natural gas minus these liquefied components (called \"residue gas\") is delivered back into the pipeline system for ultimate use as fuel.  The natural gas liquids (NGL's or Raw Mix) are sold separately for petrochemical feedstock, fuel, and other uses.  The NGL's are delivered into a Koch Company pipeline connected to the plant.\r\n\r\nThe Clinton Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Transok identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Section II - Accident Release Prevention Program, Table 1.  \r\n\r\nListed flammable substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the Clinton Gas Plant, are NGL's (product), methane and condensate.  However, Transok has determined that condensate has an NFPA rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  There are no listed toxic substances stored above threshold quantities at the Clinton Plant.\r\n\r\nBased on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint does not exceed the distance to public receptors.   In addition, the Clinton Gas Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Therefore, the Clinton Gas Plant is classified as a Program 1 process under the Accident Release Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\n1.\tWorst-Case Releases\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances"

      "SummaryText": "The endpoint for a worst-case scenario (WCS) release of a flammable substance is a 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is from one of the NGL storage tanks (i.e. product surge tank) with an endpoint 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.40 miles.  This is based on using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) equations found in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" dated May 24, 1996.   The storage capacity of the largest NGL storage tank is 40,000 gallons, which is limited to 80% or 32,000 gallons by administrative controls.  It assumes the entire contents of the tank (32,000 gallons or 125,840 pounds) is released instantaneously and is involved in the vapor cloud explosion.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nThe Clinton Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\r\n\r\n 2.\tAlternative Releases\r\n\r\nAlternative releases scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances\r\n\r\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP"

Accident prevention is discussed at monthly safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employee suggestions on improving safety processes are encouraged at these meetings. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are also documented in Section II, Part C of the PSM Manual.\r\n\r\n2.\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all employees.\r\n\r\nThe Clinton Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nThe details of this program are also identified in Section II, Part E of the PSM Manual.\r\n\r\n4.\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Clinton Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  New operators are also paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.
