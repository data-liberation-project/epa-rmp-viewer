During the past five years we have had one accidential release of chlorine, which was 21 pounds.

Olin has always had a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable.  Our goal is Zero  incidents.  To help insure that an emergency situation with off-site consequences will never arise, Olin has put six layers of safety and environmental protection in place: \n\n. Employees\n. Mechanical Integrity\n. Process Hazard Reviews\n. Process Controls\n. Monitoring Systems\n. Emergency Response\n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces chlorine, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and sodium hydrosulfite (along with other industrial chemicals), using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. Olin/Augusta employs approximately 105 people, including engineers, operating and maintenance technicians, and administrative disciplines.  The plant is located at 2402 Doug Barnard Parkway, two miles south of Augusta's Bush Field Airport.  In our processes, we use or produce the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics (Maximum Inventory)\n\nChlorine                     3,400,000 pounds\nHydrochloric Acid     2,300,000 pounds \nSulfur Dioxide           1,900,000 pounds\n\n\nAlso included in the RMP list of regulated substances and handled at the Augusta facility, but exempt from the regulation, is hydrogen.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario \u0017 Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nOur worst-case release scenario (by EPA definition) for our facility would be the catastrophic failure of one of the four 150 ton chlorine storage vessels.  These vessels have administrative controls to limit the maximum inventory.  Weight alarms prevent more than 150 tons from being present in the 188 ton tank. The contents would be released over a 10 minute period, with no mitigation measures to limit the exposure distance.  The estimated exposure distance would be greater than 25 miles, and would potentially impact public receptors (such as residences, schools, hospitals, prisons, major industrial areas, and public recreational areas), and environmental receptors (such as national and state parks, and designated wildlife sanctuaries).\n\nThis scenario is highly unlikely because of adherence to high industry standards set by The Chlorine Institute, Inc.  Tanks and associated piping are designed according to these standards,  are inspected regularly, and repairs made promptly.  One chlorine storage tank is always empty to provide space for the  transfer of chlorine in case of a leaking tank.  Chlorine and air entering these tanks are kept dry to ensure corrosion potential is very low.\n\n  \nAlternative Release Scenario(s) \u0017 Regulated Toxic Chemica"
