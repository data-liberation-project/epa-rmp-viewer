The pipeline that supplies propane to the Apex terminal is operated in compliance with applicable regulations of the U. S. Department of Transportation, \n49 CFR Part 195.  In addition, the Apex terminal maintains compliance with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management regulation given in 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as other industry safety guidelines and standards.\n\n\tThe Apex terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane, the receipt and storage of ethyl mercaptan, and loading of propane tank trucks.  The stored ethyl mercaptan in injected into the propane loaded into the trucks for the purpose of LPG odorization as an aid to leak detection.  The facility consists of propane pressure storage tanks, a six-station truck loading rack, mercaptan storage and injection equipment and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n\tThe Apex terminal has several systems in place to prevent an accidental release of pressurized liquid propane, including continuous remote monitoring of flows, pressures and levels in the facility control office and from the Dixie Pipeline control center.  The ethyl mercaptan storage tanks are filled manually by on site personnel monitoring the storage tank levels and pressure to prevent over-filling.   In addition, there are various alarms and shut downs designed to prevent over-pressure and over-filling of the storage tanks and tank trucks that are filled at the Apex terminal.  There are also pressure relief valves in place to protect the storage vessels and process piping.\n\n\tDixie Pipeline has a thorough Mechanical Integrity Program and safety procedures to protect against accidental release.  Each Dixie Pipeline facility, including the Apex Terminal, has an Emergency Manual that includes respo"

      "SummaryText": "nse procedures and personnel training requirements for emergency preparedness. \n\n\t The RMP Program 3 worst case scenario reported for the Dixie Pipeline Apex terminal, as defined in 40 CFR 68, involves the failure of one of the pressurized propane storage tanks instantaneously releasing the maximum allowable stored quantity of propane.  Ignition and explostion of the released flammable propane results in 1 psi overpressure blast wave endpoint that reaches offsite.  The alternate release scenario involves the release of a smaller estimated quantity of pressurized propane as the result of an assumed loading pump seal failure that allows propane to escape to atmosphere for 10 minutes prior to detection and manual or automatic terminal emergency shut down.  \n\n\tIn the event of an accidental release of propane, the Apex terminal has a fail-safe system in place to limit the amount of flammable vapors released.  The facility has an installed emergency shtu down (ESD) system that automatically shuts down pipeline receipts and truck loading operations and isolates the pressurized propane storage tanks and piping upon activation.  The ESD system can be activated manually on site, remotely from the Dixie Pipeline control center, or automatically from any of the numerous hazardous gas detectors located in the Apex terminal storage and loading rack areas.\n\n\tThere have been no accidents involving the release of propane or ethyl mercaptan which resulted in injury, death, or offisite property or environmental damange in the past 5 years.  In case of an accident, the Apex terminal ESD system would be activated and the local response agency would be contacted.  \n\n\tDixie Pipeline evaluates its facilities regularly to ensure that good safety practices are employed and policies and procedures are updated as needed for operating safety improvement."
