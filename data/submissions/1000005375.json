To ensure the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment, the Plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68. The policies and procedures integrated under the Plant\u00c2\u00bfs management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia. \n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant \n\nThe Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant produces fluid milk and ice cream products. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant. Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation. \n\nMechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process: the ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle. Heat is removed from the product being refrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor. By reliquefying the ammonia vapor, the ammonia can be used continuously in the refrigeration cycle. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Bellevue Milk and Ice Cream Plant which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard). Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system. \n\nAt ambient temperature and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic, irritating odor. \nAmmonia is highly soluble in water.
