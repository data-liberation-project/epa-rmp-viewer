Andres and , Steven D. Andres and Ricky L. Andres. They have a full time bookkeeper and a parttime bookkeeper. As owners/operators, the Andres family is committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and to the safety of the persons living in their community.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\n    Elbing Grain LLC is a retail outlet for agricultural products including feed, animal health products,seed,fertilizer, and herbicides. In addition, it receives and ships out grain including Corn, Milo, Soybeans, and Wheat.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a part of the fertilizer sales program. The ammonia plant consists of two above ground non-refrigated tanks: a 30,000 gallon tank and a 12,000 gallon tank. The two tanks are interconnected with pipes for vapor exchange and the movement of liquid, however the tanks are used separately. Two vapor exchange pumps are used to move liquid from the storage tanks to 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for farm use.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is recieved via tank trucks and unloaded by the liquid pump on the truck. Vapor lines are used to equalize the pressure between the tank truck and the storage tanks to prevent overpressurization.\n\n\n\nThe maximum stored in the storage tanks would be 42,000 gallons or 196,350 pounds. And with 25 1,000 gallon nurse tanks storage of those would be 25,000 gallons or 116,875 pounds. Combined storage total of 67,000 gallons or 313,225 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Worst case scenario\n\n\n\n\n\n     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank, 30,000 gallons or 140,250 and the small tank 12,000 gallons or 56,100 pounds which represents 85% capacity as limited by the design standards.

      "SummaryText": "elease rate would be 19635.0 pounds per minute for a 10 minute duration.  Estimated wind speed at 1.5 meters/second and the distance to endpoint would be 1.63 miles.  Given the built in sfety of excess flow valves, in our opinion, there are only two instances where the worst case scenario could occur.  A tornado or a train derailment on the Union Pacific Railroad,which is 75 feet from the plant.\n\n\n\n4.  Alternative release scenario\n\n\n\nThe most likely potential for an alternative release would be a break in a transfer hose.  Such a break would release a total of 11908 pounds at 5964 per minute for 2 minutes.  In this instance the most likely distance to endpoint is .60 miles.\n\n\n\n5. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and handling of anydrous ammonia.\"\n\n\n\n7.  The facility has:\n\n\n\n(a) a writen emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n(b) provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (Epcra).\n\n(c) a written emergency response program, in accordance ith OSHA standard  29 CFR 1910.120, including planning and employee training.\n\n(d) call 9-1-1.\n\n(e) plant manager participates in an annual training session with local fire department personnel at the plant site.\n\n\n\n8.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nElbing Grain Company stresses to its employees and customers that safety is of the first importance in the discharge of duties.  Constant evaluations of conditions at the plant are made while employees are moving anydrous ammonia.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations at this time.\n\n\n\n                                                        /s/ Edwin H.
