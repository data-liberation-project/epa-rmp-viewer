As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Monrovia Nursery has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.

The facility has several chlorine systems that are used for the disinfection of irrigation water in order to protect plants from various pathogens. The chlorine is metered into water streams and distributed as chlorinated irrigation water at the following locations:\r\n \r\nWest Recycle\r\nEast Recylce\r\nRiver Pump\r\n \r\nChlorine System Equipment\r\nThe processes operate as follows: ton containers are connected to the irrigation water disinfection process through process tubing and piping at the three (3) injection locations. Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton containers by a vacuum created by the flow of water from the water pump. This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the chlorine gas from the ton containers at a controlled feed rate set by the operators with the use of the rate valve on the chlorinator. The gas is injected into the water feed line where it becomes a chlorine/water solution and is distributed to the various locations throughout the plant in need of irrigation water.  \r\n \r\n \r\nProcess Chemistry\r\nAt Monrovia Nursery chlorine gas (Cl2) is used for the disinfection of irrigation water in order to protect plants from various pathogens. The chlorine, when added to water, yields both chloric (HCl) and hypochlorous (HOCl) acid (see chemical equation below)"

Note that the equation below is easily reversible which results in off-gassing of chlorine gas from water that contains high concentrations of the acids.\r\n\r\nCl2 + H2O &#8594; HOCl + HCl\r\n\r\nThe chlorination process begins with the chlorine gas being drawn from the ton containers through a pressure reducing valve, reduced to a vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted inside the chlorinator, metered through a manually-adjusted rate valve, and finally injected into water. \r\n \r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nAll ton containers are chocked or cradled and stored securely in the chlorine process areas. The chlorine process areas are fenced and locked at all times. \r\nSeveral safety features are built into the vacuum regulators used in the chlorination process at Monrovia Nursery. The regulator acts as a safety shut-off valve in the event that the vacuum is broken. A pressure relief vent has also been incorporated into the vacuum regulator to prevent pressure from building up in the system.\r\nEach chlorine ton container at Monrovia Nursery is protected from overpressure with three (3) fusible plugs on each side of the container (6 total). The fusible plugs consist of a brass plug with a fusible metal insert that is designed to melt between 157\u00baF-170\u00baF.\r\nEmergency eyewash and safety showers are located in various areas throughout the facility and can be used to decontaminate if chemical exposure occurs.\r\nFire extinguishers are located near the chlorine processes to assist in handling small fires that could occur during normal operation.\r\nWind socks are located near the chlorine processes. Employees have been instructed to consider the wind direction when evacuating during a chlorine release.\r\n \r\nProcess Classification\r\nEach chlorine injection system at Monrovia Nursery consists of ton containers, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.
