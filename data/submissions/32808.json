WRMWD personnel will not attempt to a stop a major chlorine leak.  However, procedures have been established for notifying the Fire Department, Sheriff's Department, and Emergency Medical Services (if needed).  Procedures have also been established for notifying all persons within 1/2 mile of the WTP concerning a major chlorine leak.  Depending on the severity of the leak and prevailing wind conditions, people will be advised to either move immediately upwind of the leak or to remain indoors with windows close and air conditioners and ventilation systems turned off.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION/REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe WRMWD is a 4.5 MGD water treatment facility which provides treated water to the Cities of Crosbyton, Post, Ralls, and Spur, Texas.  Chlorine, propane, chlorine dioxide, and ammonia are handled at the WTP.  However, only chlorine are stored in quantities subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68.\n\nWORST-CASE"

      "SummaryText": "AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case release scenario assumes a 2,000 pound release over ten minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, an F stability class, and rural topography.  Using the American Water Works Association Research Foundation's (AWWARF) Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants results in a worst-case distance to toxic endpoint of 3.10 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a valve or pipe failure resulting in a 5/16-inch diameter opening.  Using the above-mentioned AWWARF Guidance Document, a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second, a D stability class, and rural topography resulted in a 0.57 distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis was summarized above under Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents subject to reporting under 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis was summarized above under Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nSAFETY CHANGES RESULTING FROM 1999 RMP\n\nAs a  result of the initial 1999 RMP, a number of changes were implemented to improve safety.  These changes included:\n\n1.  Replacing existing chlorine pressure feed system with a vacuum feed system;\n2.  Installation of a windsock in a visible location;\n3.  Installation of chlorine detectors and;\n4.  Requiring escape-type breathing units to be worn by two operators when changing chlorine containers."
