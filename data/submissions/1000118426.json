The Safety Council meets monthly to discuss the status of issues noted previously, bring forward new concerns and assign people to address, and conduct an inspection of a section of the facility.  The meeting is documented and the notes are posted for all department personnel to review.  We also have a daily meeting with operations personnel to not only discuss the day\u0092s plan but to ask for any safety issues or concerns that need to be investigated.\nWe also do routine self-auditing on various permitted safety activities (lockout tagout, hot work, confined space, breaking into process, working from heights) to ensure out policies and procedures are being followed and solicit input from employees and contractors on potential improvements."
