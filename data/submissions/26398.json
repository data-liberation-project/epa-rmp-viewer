      "SummaryText": "Slack Chemical is a chemical warehousing and distribution company. Our \"Worst Case Scenario\" would be a ruptured or leaking chlorine cylinder. Our scenario is not a stationary source but because of the quantity of chlorine on hand it falls under the RMP. The chlorine is in ton and 150# cylinders and is located in warehouse 'E'. At any one time there could be 24,000 pounds of chlorine on hand. Slack Chemical does not use the chlorine but receives and warehouses it in cylinders for shipment to customer facilities. A set of our \"Worst Case Scenario\" plans are located at the entrance door to warehouse E, the receptionist desk and at the Director of Regulatory Compliance's office. The policies are explained in the plan. Slack Chemical is located at the base of the foot hills of the Adirondak Mountains and is located 30 miles east of Lake Ontario. The facility is located in the Village of Carthage, Jefferson County, and is in a residential neighborhood. In the worst case scenario a ton chlorine cylinder would rupture releasing its contents into the atmosphere. The resulting plume of vapors could travel approximately 7,800+ feet before dissipating to 5 PPM or less. This condition depends upon the weather. The release could last 5 minutes according to the Chlorine Institute. Depending on the wind condition the release could drift towards an elementary school is occupied during school with 600 students and staff, a hospital and residences. Slack Chemical has worked with the elementary scholl in developing an evacuation plan. An incident affecting the elementary school is unlikely due to the normal wind direction and the location of the cylinders in relation to the school and hospital. Slack Chemicals prevention program has been established around the transportation and storage of the product since it is not a stationary process. There are Job Task descriptions in writing on how chlorine is to be handled and stored. The ton cylinders are rolled onto forklift tongs and locked "

      "SummaryText": "into place with blocks, cargo straps and cargo bars to prevent them from shifting/moving. The cylinders are stored in a warehouse on pressure treated 4\"X4\" tracks and chocked. When delivering a cylinder there is a specially designed bracket used to prevent the cylinder from rolling off the tail gate. All valves are protected by the housing unit. The 150# cylinders are rolled off the truck by hand or with a hand cart. They are stored upright with chain supporting them to prevent them from falling. The full cylinders are separated from the emptys. Slack Chemical has repair kits for both type cylinders and the employees have been trained in their use. Slack Chemical has never had an accident or accidental release of chlorine from the cylinders. In the event of an incident Slack Chemical has an emergency response team to respond. Eight employees are HAZWOPER trained and two are First responders. One employee has taken the EPA 40 hour course. Our first joint training session with the Jefferson County Hazardous Materials Response Team will be in the fall of 2002. Public notification of an incident can be accomplished through phone calling, radio and door-to-door. The determination to evacuate or not will be made by the Incident Commander, Emergency Management Office Coordinator or the Mayor of Carthage."
