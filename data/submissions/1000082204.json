      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention \n\nSFID - R.E. Badger Filtration Plant has developed a Risk Management Program and an Emergency Response Plan to address CalARP Program requirements (19 CCR ?2735-2785).  \n\nSFID - R.E. Badger Filtration Plant has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorination and the ammonia injection systems.  SFID - R.E. Badger Filtration Plant's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nThe SFID - R.E. Badger Filtration Plant is located at 18535 Aliso Canyon Road, \n\nRancho Santa Fe, California. 92067.\n\nThe regulated substances at the Facility are:\n\n?    Chlorine.  This regulated substance is used in their chlorination system for final effluent disinfection.  The chlorination system consists of a gaseous chlorine storage and feed system.  The gaseous chlorine is housed in the chlorine storage room.  The storage room contains eight scales, each configured with four one-ton chlorine cylinders, for a total of eight one-ton cylinders.  However, only four cylinders are utilized simultaneously, while the additional four are on stand-by.  A total of up to eight gaseous chlorine one-ton cylinders are located on site at any given time.\n\n?    30% aqueous ammonia. This regulated substance is used in their aqueous ammonia system consists of a liquid storage tank (T-10) outfitted with pressure relief valves containing 30% aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) solution.  Rather than using a metering pump, compressed air is supplied to the storage tank to maintain a slight positive pressure.  The aqueous ammonia is then fed at a small rate to the T.M. Vault Drip Line, F.M. Chamber Drip Line, and FCW Drip Line. \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analy"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2014 Five Year Update Binder.\n\n?Alternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled for each covered process at the Facility.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2014 Five Year Update Binder.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; SFID - R.E. Badger Filtration Plant has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including the following:\n\n?    Ammonia and chlorine sensors are located in the process areas.\n\n?    Gas detection is in place to notify individuals if a leak occurs.\n\n?    The covered processes have alarms and interlocks.\n\n?    Automatic/Manual shutdowns are in place.\n\n?    P"
