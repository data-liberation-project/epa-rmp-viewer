The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\r\n\r\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \r\n\r\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the CHENEY BROTHERS - PUNTA GORDA FACILITY is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the CHENEY BROTHERS - PUNTA GORDA FACILITY 's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the CHENEY BROTHERS - PUNTA GORDA FACILITY is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\n2.

The results would normally be mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the some of the piping are inside the CHENEY BROTHERS - PUNTA GORDA FACILITY building; however, an unmitigated scenario was used to determine an extremely conservative estimate. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\r\n\r\n4.

CHENEY BROTHERS - PUNTA GORDA FACILITY has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The CHENEY BROTHERS - PUNTA GORDA FACILITY conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n7.
