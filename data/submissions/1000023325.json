Smithfield - Clinton Plant is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\n\n \n- Emergency Response\n\nSmithfield - Clinton Plant Emergency Action/Response Plan is part of the overall facility Integrated Contingency Plan, (ICP). The ICP focuses on response to various types of emergencies that could take place at the facility. In the event of an ammonia spill or release the ICP contains specific procedures to be implemented by designated Smithfield personnel.  The ICP includes procedures for emergency response, facility evacuation, as well as notification of local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The Plan also allows Smithfield - Clinton Plant personnel trained in emergency response operations to respond to an upset or release. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSmithfield - Clinton Plant's goal is to provide a safe, professional work environment while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever possible. In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce, or eliminate, the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics in the performance of our service. Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible."

      "SummaryText": "RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSmithfield - Clinton Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently, Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration systems. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration for our production, cold storage and distribution operations. Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Smithfield - Clinton Plant is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Worst Case and the Alternative Case Release Scenarios for the covered process have been completed and are discussed in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (Revision 1.07) was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp (Revision 1.07)) model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file with the Smithfield - Clinton Plant Environmental Manager.
