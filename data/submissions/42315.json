(Kemiron) facility located at 18700 Highway 14 North in Mojave, California 93501 (also referred to within Kemiron as the Mojave Plant).  The facility is located in an undeveloped area approximately 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Mojave.  The Mojave Airport, which is the nearest neighboring facility, is approximately 1 mile away. \n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with the risk management planning requirements as set forth in Section 25535(d) of Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program - CalARP) and Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR Part 68), also known as the federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs or the federal RMP.  \n\nThe scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at Kemiron?s Mojave facility which involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine (i.e., chlorine is the only regulated substances which is handled at the facility above the threshold quantity).  \n\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nPRIMARY OPERATIONS\n\nThe primary operation conducted at Kemiron?s Mojave facility is the manufacture of ferrous chloride and ferric chloride (NAICS Code 325188, SIC Code 2819).  The primary components utilized in the process include water, hydrochloric acid, chlorine and scrap iron.  Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the above-referenced regulations.  Chlorine is the only such regulated substance handled at the facility.  Provided below, is a brief description of the storage, handling and use of chlorine at the site.\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE \n\nThe manufacturing process consists of the following components:\n\n? A maximum of ten 90-ton railcars of chlorine (i.e., a maximum onsite inventory of 1,800,000 pounds of chlorine);\n? Two c"

      "SummaryText": "ontinuous chlorinators for reacting water, chlorine, and hydrochloric acid to manufacture ferrous chloride;\n? Three chlorinators utilized to convert ferrous chloride to ferric chloride; \n? One settling tank;\n? A number of heat exchangers; and\n? System piping, controls and instrumentation.\n\nNinety ton railcars of chlorine are delivered to the facility and parked in dedicated spots.  Liquid chlorine from the railcar, hydrochloric acid and water are mixed in two continuous chlorinators.  The resulting solution is circulated through dissolver tanks containing scrap iron/steel.  This results in the manufacture of a weak ferrous chloride solution.  The solution is recirculated until a rich ferrous chloride solution is made.  \n\nThe rich ferrous chloride solution is fed to three chlorinators.  Chlorine is added to the chlorinator until the desired ferric chloride solution is manufactured.  The resulting solution is fed to product storage tanks.\n\nCentral Emergency Vacuum Relief Device (CEVRD)\nKemiron has installed a central emergency vacuum relief device (CEVRD).  The CEVRD is connected to the overhead relief of each of the chlorinators onsite.  The CEVRD utilizes a  solution of ferrous chloride to scrub out excess chlorine.  \n\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe RMP regulations require that at least two types of release scenarios be evaluated for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n? the worst case release; and\n? an alternative release (that is more credible).\n\nA number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the RMP.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed in the technical studies maintained at the facility.\n\n\nES 3.0 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, the facility has NOT had any releases of chlorine which have resulted i"

Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nES 4.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at Kemiron?s Mojave facility consists of a series of programs, procedures and policies designed to minimize the risk of accidental releases involving chlorine.  These programs include design and operating controls, compliance with specified codes, the facility?s health and safety program, numerous standard operating procedures, the equipment inspection and maintenance program (including a mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance program), site security, the management of change program, pre-start-up review, fire prevention/fire protection/hot work permit program, management of- and safety of- contractors, accident/incident investigation procedures, emergency response plan, RMP compliance auditing program, record keeping and a variety of training programs.  Details of each of these components of the facility?s Accidental Release Prevention Program are provided in the document entitled Risk Management Plan (RMP), Volume I - Prevention Program (maintained at the facility).  \n\nThere are several chlorine leak detection and monitoring devices and other protective devices (e.g.., for fire protection, etc.) placed at strategic locations throughout the facility. \n\nES 5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nKemiron recognizes that emergency planning and emergency response are an integral component of risk management.   As such, Kemiron currently has emergency action plans and emergency evacuation plans in place. In addition, the facility has developed a Fire Prevention Plan.  These programs work together to mitigate the effects of unplanned releases or events.  However, as a continuous measure to improve safety, the facility reviews its emergency response plan, evacuation plan and fire "

This also ensures that the facility incorporates the latest safety developments into its existing programs.\n\nES 6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA detailed hazard and operability study (i.e., hazards analysis) was performed on ALL operations involving chlorine in order to evaluate the potential for accidental releases.  As required under the California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, section 2745.7 (q)(1-4), the hazards analysis included an analysis of natural and human caused external events.  Additionally, in 1994 the facility conducted a detailed seismic risk assessment.  As a result of the most recent hazards analysis conducted, a number of recommendations were made to improve the safety of the operations conducted.  The recommended actions are summarized in Table ES-1.  Table ES-1 also presents the implementation status of the recommended actions.  As shown, Kemiron has already implemented a number of the recommendations.  Table ES-1 also presents the expected date of implementation for those recommendations not yet implemented.  \n\n\nES 7.0 FOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nKemiron recognizes that some persons may be interested in obtaining more detailed information regarding risk management and prevention program components not discussed herein.  Interested parties that have additional questions regarding the facility?s Risk Management Plan, are directed to contact:\n\nMr. John Reiter\nKemiron Pacific, Inc.\n18700 Highway 14 North\nMojave, California 93501"
