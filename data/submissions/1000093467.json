The plant has blown out the pipelines within their block limits and installed blind flanges to the site header for Chlorine on December 2nd, 2020 and for Vinylidene Chloride on December 3rd, 2020. Due to the removal of these two chemicals, the 941 plant is no longer subject to RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nRemoved Chlorine from 858, since the plant has been shut down.  The plant has blown out the pipeline within their block limits and installed a blind flange to the site header for Chlorine on April 9th, 2021. Due to the removal of this chemical and the shutdown of the plant, 858 is no longer subject to RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCorteva Agriscience, LLC Midland Operations is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland Fire Department and Midland LEPC which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nCorteva Agriscience, LLC Midland Operations primary activity is chemical manufacturing, including agricultural and "

There are three (3) covered processes, five (5) programs and six (6) regulated substances present at the stationary source.  \n\nThe regulated substances are listed below.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\n\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous)\n\nChlorine\n\nCrotonaldehyde [2-butenal]\n\nDimethylamine\n\nSulfur dioxide\n\nVinylidene chloride\n\n\n\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection\n\n\n\nThere was one (1) worst case toxic and one (1) worst case flammable scenario reported in this submittal. There are five (5) total alternate cases reported, one of which is a flammable case.  Most of the toxic alternate cases were reported due to that being the only alternate case for the chemical.  No toxic alternate cases for chlorine impacted a population, so the scenario reported for chlorine was the only alternate case that reached an endpoint off-site. The flammable alternate case reported in the previous submission is no longer applicable, since the 941 plant doesn't have Vinylidene Chloride anymore, therefore a different scenario needed to be reported. The new flammable alternate case scenario reported is a Dimethylamine release from the 489 plant. This flammable alternate case was chosen due to it being the closest scenario to affect a population based on the location in the plant.  It has the closest scenario with an endpoint to an off-site location. EPA RMP*Comp and MARPLOT were used to evaluate the worst and alternate case scenarios. \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nCorteva Agriscience, LLC Midland Operations has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
