In addition to other generating facilities, TEC owns and operates the F.J. Gannon Station located on Tampa's Port Sutton Road in Hillsborough County, Florida.\n\nTEC is re-powering the existing coal-fired Gannon Station.  The repowered station will be natural-gal fired and will be known as the Bayside Power Station (BPS).  BPS will be comprised of two combined-cycle units.  Unit 1 will consist of three General Electric Model PG7241(FA) combustion turbines, three Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) and one repowered steam turbine generator.  Unit 2 will consist of four General Electric Model PG7241(FA) combustion turbines, four Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) and one repowered steam turbine generator.  The repowered plant will have a nominal capacity of approximately 1750 MW (approximately 750 MW from Unit 1 and approximately 1000 MW from Unit 2).  Steam from Unit 1's three new combined-cycle units will re-power existing Gannon steam-electric turbine Unit No. 5, which has a nameplate rating of 239 MW.  Steam from Unit 2's four new combined-cycle units will re-power existing Gannon steam-electric turbine Unit No. 6, which has a nameplate rating of 414 MW.\n\nAll of the existing six coal-fired boilers at Gannon will be shut down before January 1, 2005.  The overall thermal efficiency of the plant is predicted to increase from approximately 30% to 55%.  It is estimated that the Bayside project will reduce actual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by more than 28,000 tons per year, particulate matter (PM/PM10) by more than 900 tons per year, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by more than 50,000 tons per year.

The HRSGs have selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems installed to further reduce NOx emissions.   The SCR system will consist of an ammonia injection grid, catalyst, ammonia storage, a monitoring and control system, electrical system, piping, and other ancillary equipment.

Under the threshold determination criteria, if a regulated substance is present in a process in a quantity of 10,000 pounds or more of the substance, TEC must address the risks posed by the regulated substance in the applicable process.  The SCR system contains two ammonia storage tanks with a total capacity of 98,824 pounds of anhydrous ammonia each, and a minimum and maximum operating level of 5,000 and 84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, respectively.

The plan addresses potential emergencies identified by a facility-wide risk analysis conducted by a team of environmental professionals, health and safety specialists, and Bayside Power Station personnel.  The plan identifies specific responsibilities and procedures to be followed by all facility personnel following an accident or impending emergency to maximize employee and community safety.
