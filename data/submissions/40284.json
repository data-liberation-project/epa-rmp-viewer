              "Description": "Morrilton Meat Packing is a cold storage/warhousing facility.  This facility falls under the NAICS Cods 311612.  Our safety information was last reviewed on July 25, 2004 (safety meetings are also conducted every month).  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  These standards, and all applicable OSHA requirements have been implemented here through written manuals with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc.  The most recent hazard review was conducted on May 5, 2004.  Since this is a recently updated system, there were no major hazards identified during the review.  To aid in the prevention of releases, this facility uses standard operating and maintenance procedures for the refrigeration system, vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, and grounding equipment.   The refrigeration technicians of Morrilton Meat Packing are trained in the classroom and by on-the-job training.  This training is completed by demonstration and observation of working knowledge of the system.  The training programs were last conducted in May of 2004 when Ray Gunderman, Daron Robertson, Ray Williamson, Edward Ruff, and Ed McAnulty completed the Hazardous Material Refresher Course given by Environmental Services Group, Inc. trainer Gary Ingle.  Other training information was reviewed during a visit by Environmental  Services Group, Inc. on July 25, 2004.  This visit promted a review of safety, training, operations, etc. at Morrilton Meat Packing.  \nEmployees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system are knowledgeable in the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Manual provided by the manufacturer.  Employees follow the start-up procedures to aid in the prevention of accidental releases of anydrous ammonia.    The last review of maintenance procedures was completed May 25, 2004.  However, employees perform daily and weekly visual inspections to check for abnormal operating conditions which may cause the release of ammonia from the system.    Different components of the refrigeration system are checked on a daily basis to ensure performance.  Compressors, accumulators, condesors, receivers, cold rooms, alarms, and purgers of the system are checked by use of a list.  This list has several different aspect of each component of the systm.  For instance, the Compressors are chekced for Suction Pressure, Suction Temperature, Discharge Pressure, Discharge Temperature, Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature, etc.  If any items noted on the checklist are not within the recommended operating zones, the maintenance personnel determine the cause and correct the problem, with the assistance of the O&M Manual.  Also, maintnenance personnel conduct preventative maintenance on the system twice per year with the aid of Baker Refrigeration to help prevent releases of anhydrous ammonia due to equipment failure.  The oil is changed in compressors while Daron Robertson, MMP  Refrigeration technician, pulls the side plates off all compressors to inspect for wear.  Any work such as changing valves, seals, etc. are performed as needed.  Certified refrigeration technitian (Darren Robertson) helps to oversee the any maintenance conducted on the system. Baker Refrigeration is an outside contractor who also helps to ensure the proper installation of system components if needed.\n\nMorrilton Meat Packing (MMP) contracted Environemtnal Services Group, Inc., which triggered a review of our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training. Morrilton Meat Packing is a Level 3 Prevention Program Facility, and is implementing Process Safety Management at this location to help in the prevention of accidental releases from this facility.",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIn this cold storage facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental  Services Group, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Morrilton Packing Company Hazmat Responders, the Morrilton Fire Department, then the notification of Ray Gunderman (Safety Director), and then notifying the Conway County 911 System for 911 call-out to affected responding agencies.  The Morrilton Fire Department and Morrilton Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Conway County LEPC.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to cool and/or freeze storage compartments by utilizing anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a reciever in the engine room building.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  The system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage Compressor serves the Freezer Dock, Cooler, Cooler Dock and the Lo Stage Compressor discharge loads."

      "SummaryText": "  The Lo Stage system serves the freezer.  Other associated systems are the thermosyphon oil cooling for the compressors, liquid feed make up, purge, and condensing system.  Note:  The  system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with this description. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 51 Blue Diamond Drive location is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 13,000 pounds.  This amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\n \nThis cold storage facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.  We have discussed this program with the Conway County LEPC, the Conway County Sheriff's Office, the Morrilton Police Department, as well as the Morrilton Fire Department. A representative of Environmental  Services Group, Inc. visited this plant July 25, 2004, which prompted a review of our written safety procedures, operating and maintenance procedures, our prevention program, and our emergency response  plans.\n\nThe cold storage system was originally constructed in 1986, and underwent additions in 1999. This facility is striving to be in compliance with all applicable regulations applicable to this facility."
