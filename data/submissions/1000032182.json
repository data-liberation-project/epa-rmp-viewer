Members of management regularly attend and participate in the Pueblo County Local Emergency Planning Committee meetings.  We maintain written emergency preparedness plans that are regularly reviewed and updated as needed.  \n\n\n\nOur facility typically hosts open house every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  KMG makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation on many local organizations.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\n\n\nThis facility provides high purity chemicals to the semi-conductor industry.  The regulated substances handled are anhydrous ammonia, hydrochloric acid and ammonium hydroxide.  \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with written operating and maintenance procedures for the covered processes.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the ope"
