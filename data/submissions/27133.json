      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY for Wolcott Branch:\n\n1. The Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of IMPACT LLC, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidnetal release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC, or other agencies, to control any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people, property and the environment.\n\n2. Description of our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site, and is a substance regulated by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Managment Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricutural crops.\n\nThis facility maintains approximately 63 - 1,000-gallon tanks and 10 - 1,500-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery. Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks in 364,260 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 2 stationary storage tanks (2 @ 18,000) gallons on site. The maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tanks is 168,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity is 532,26 pounds. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 84,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, t"

      "SummaryText": "his release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. It should be noted that IMPACT LLC has never had a release of an entire stationary anydrous ammonia stoarge tank from any distribution facility.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. It should be noted IMPACT LLC has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific prevention steps:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1980), OSHA (29 CRF 1910.111). EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs,and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All main storage tank valves and riser valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards. Training is provided to all employees at le"

      "SummaryText": "ast annually, whenever there is a change in the process, or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification, and on the job training.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuires, property or environmental damage, including evacuation or or off-site.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia relese. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, IMPACT LLC has an Emergency Response and Contigency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200). The plan includes provisions for public notification, initial medical care, evacuations, and LEPC coordination.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures. We will also provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
