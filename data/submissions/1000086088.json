The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(3) Pre-Cooling Rooms\n\n(3) Post Cooling Rooms\n\n(1) Water Chiller\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 is located at 786 Road 188, Delano, CA 93215. The latitude and longitude of High Pressure Receiver 2 is 35.802973, -119.150941. The facility is located approximately 6 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. A review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed the following faults within close proximity:\n\nPond Fault - < 150 Years\n\nPoso Creek Fault - <1.6 Million Years\n\n\n\nVarious Unnamed Faults Near Rag Gulch - <1.6 Million Years \n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. \n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access.

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has had one accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\nOn 5/16/2021, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 had an accidental release of ammonia. The accident occurred at approximately 12:40 AM. The accident occurred when A 3-inch strip of tarp was sucked into the lower bunker fan in Postcooler 2. Two fan blades broke and flew into the east evaporator, puncturing two holes and causing the leak. The duration of the release was estimated to be 190 minutes before a contractor closed the liquid feed and suction isolation valves to Postcooler 2, stopping the leak.\n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 4,601 lbs. Employees evacuated with no injuries. The ammonia was contained inside Postcooler 2 and the surrounding cold rooms. The local CUPA, 911, State Warning Center, and the National Response Center were notified.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910."
