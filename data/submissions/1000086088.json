Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and \n\ntracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name            | Process Chemical           | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration     Anhydrous Ammonia            12,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation"

The latitude and longitude of High Pressure Receiver 2 is 35.802973, -119.150941. The facility is located approximately 6 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. A review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed the following faults within close proximity:\n\nPond Fault - < 150 Years\n\nPoso Creek Fault - <1.6 Million Years\n\n\n\nVarious Unnamed Faults Near Rag Gulch - <1.6 Million Years \n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. \n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to "

      "SummaryText": "ity is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 12,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has had one accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\nOn 5/16/2021, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 had an accidental release of ammonia. The accident occurred at approximately 12:40 AM. The accident occurred when A 3-inch strip of tarp was sucked into the lower bunker fan in Postcooler 2. Two fan blades broke and flew into the east evaporator, puncturing two holes and causing the leak. The duration of the release was estimated to be 190 minutes before a contractor closed the liquid feed and suction isolation valves to Postcooler 2, stopping the leak.\n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 4,601 lbs. Employees evacuated with no injuries. The ammonia was contained inside Postcooler 2 and the surrounding cold rooms. The local CUPA, 911, State Warning Center, and the National Response Center were notified.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910."

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has implemented all asp"

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 employees, but allows \n\nfor feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
