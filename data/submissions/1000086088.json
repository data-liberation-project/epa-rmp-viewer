Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and \r\ntracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name            | Process Chemical           | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration     Anhydrous Ammonia            12,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation"

Nevertheless, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has implemented all asp"

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 employees, but allows \r\nfor feedback and continual improvement.

As such, the refrigeration system at Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 facil"

      "SummaryText": "ity is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 12,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1 has had one accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\nOn 5/16/2021, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 1 had an accidental release of ammonia. The accident occurred at approximately 12:40 AM. The accident occurred when A 3-inch strip of tarp was sucked into the lower bunker fan in Postcooler 2. Two fan blades broke and flew into the east evaporator, puncturing two holes and causing the leak. The duration of the release was estimated to be 190 minutes before a contractor closed the liquid feed and suction isolation valves to Postcooler 2, stopping the leak.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 4,601 lbs. Employees evacuated with no injuries. The ammonia was contained inside Postcooler 2 and the surrounding cold rooms. The local CUPA, 911, State Warning Center, and the National Response Center were notified.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 1's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910."
