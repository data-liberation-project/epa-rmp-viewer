The FHWRP is located at 1700 Railroad Drive in the northeast portion of the City of El Paso, Texas. The FHWRP is surrounded by urban, residential, and vacant land.\n\n\n\nCurrently the FHWRP has the potential to store up to three (3) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage area, allowing the potential to store a total of 6,000 pounds of chlorine. However, the normal storage is two (2) one-ton chlorine containers at any one time. The average amount of chlorine managed at FHWRP is 4,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n\n\n?    Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 3 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 7,300 people, and the alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people. \n\n\n\n?    Develop strategies to prevent an accidental release (Prevention Program), \n\n\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n"
