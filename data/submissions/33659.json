      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis facility stores anhydrous ammonia for retail sale to farmers as fertilizer.  \n\nThis facility observes safety precautions in handling ammonia to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the environment, and adheres to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Note:  This company follows the version of the ANSI standards that has been adopted by the Kansas Department of Agriculture.  As the KDA adopts more recent versions of the standard we will budget time and money necessary to insure our facility meets the new guidelines.  \n\nWe also follow strict loss control guidelines set forth by our insurance company as a prerequisite for maintaining our insurance.  Safety depends upon the manner in which the facility handles ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, and the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel.  \n\nThis company was formerly operated by Collingwood Grain.  The last compliance was due during their ownership.  Unforturtuneately they took all their documentation with them after the sale.  We will be doing a performance audit in 2005.\n\nThe capacity of this facility was calculated as follows:\n\nThe main tank is 18,000 gallons at 100% water capacity.  The tank can only be filled to 85% by law.  The MSDS says that NH 3 weighs 5.14 pounds per gallon.  This brings the total to 78,642 pounds.  \n\nThe nure tanks that would be on site at any given time is 21 @ 1,000 gallons each.  When calculated using the same method the total additional storage would be 91,749#.  \n\nThe total amount of NH3 on site at any one time would therefore be 170,391#.\n\nThis facility does not have an emergency response plan.  By definition we have an emergency action plan.  We call the emergency responders, evacuate our employees and any needed residences, and prevent reentry until the first responders direct us that it is safe to reenter.  We submit our NH3 annually as part of the Tier II "

      "SummaryText": "requirements along with a letter inviting the local first responders to tour our facility for training purposes.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario/Alternative Case Scenario: These have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to concerns raised by the Homeland Security Act.  All necessary information will be forwarded to the first responders.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\nWe believe that the best form of release prevention is training.  Employees are sent to training meetings at least once every three years.  All fill hoses are connected to breakaway devices and each product line is equipped with excess flow valves.  We will continue to search for new technology and methods that may improve the safety of our operation.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the last five years at this facility.\n\nPlanned Changes or improvements:\nNo changes or improvements are necessary at this time.  However, we will continuously review our facility and update according to need and changes in federal or state law, particularly in the area of security.  One recent change made was the addition of a new gate that allows all nurse tanks to be transported to the scales without intruding into the residential area west of the storage area.  We feel this is a definite improvement as it reduces the exposure of the local residents."
