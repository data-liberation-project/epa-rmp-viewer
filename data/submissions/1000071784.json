The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.

The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency action plan that need to be addressed.

As a rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\n\n\n\nSee the Prevention Program Element 10 for the complete guidelines. \n\nThe supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained in the Safety & Training Manager's Office and on APSM website.\n\n\n\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\n\nThis permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. Maintenance reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operation and "

The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \n\n\n\nSee the Prevention Program Element 12 for the complete guidelines. \n\nThe supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained through ISNetworld.\n\n\n\nA-5    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere were no reportable ammonia releases that meet the reporting regulation at the California Dairies, Inc. Turlock Processing Plant during the last 5 years. \n\n\n\nA-6    EMERGENCY RESPONSE/ACTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCalifornia Dairies, Inc. Turlock Processing Plant has trained personnel to implement the Emergency Action Plan for flammables, fire, earthquake, hazardous materials and other emergencies. \n\n\n\nFacility personnel should coordinate with responding outside agencies such as Turlock Fire.  The facility has coordinated with outside parties through drills.  Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency. In addition, Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities capabilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and/or a chemical release.\n\n\n\nDetailed plans have been developed to assist responders and company personnel.  All areas (zones) can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if "

Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\n\n\nThe plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and controls for the system with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches and controls are identified at the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe facility will assist outside agencies on the facility during large releases of hazardous chemicals, as personnel do not enter IDLH atmospheres.  All personnel will evacuate to the meeting areas and be accounted for.\n\n\n\nA-7    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns.  The prevention program has been updated because of recent addition / changes of equipment.  A PHA study was conducted at California Dairies Inc. Turlock Processing Plant and the study team made recommendations for additional safety.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, the prior process hazard analysis was revalidated, and no new recommendations were proposed as part of the study.  However, California Dairies, Inc. Turlock Processing Plant continues to implement recommendations from the mechanical integrity inspection which will help to ensure the safe operation of the covered process equipment.  The facility also continues to implement recommendations from compliance audits which helps ensure the facility is within the program guidelines and any recommendations from the safety committee.\n\n\n\n"
