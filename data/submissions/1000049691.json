The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained for use in future PHAs or PHA revalidation.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention since the initial start up of the facility and is committed to maintaining this excellent record in the years to come.   There have been no releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect the safety of workers and the public, as well as the environment.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance, including the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire department, and mechanisms for notification are in place.  Employees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency actions.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary, and affected personnel are informed and/or trained in the changes.  The facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nTrade Secrets\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility has no known trade secret information which requires special handling or protection of the information."

      "SummaryText": "Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC owns and operates a fluid handling and compressor facility, the Carbide Facility, outside of Hastings, WV.   The facility is designed to remove liquids from natural gas by physical separation and dehydration methods.  Both petroleum condensates and produced fluids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas or field gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\n\r\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Carbide Facility because the facility handles and stores several EPA regulated flammable substances:  methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, isopentane and heptane.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the facility:\r\n\r\n1. Section 112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The gist of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to properly manage the situation.  Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Carbide Facility, as well as, all of its other operations.  Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC is committed to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors within the community.  The Carbide Facility, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness for our facility.\r\n\r\n2. Risk Management Plan - The Carbide Facility removes natural gas liquids and produces pipeline quality natural gas.  This process involves the handling and storage of chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in Section 112(r).   Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\r\nFor planning purposes, Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC has considered the impact of a worst case a"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Carbide Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\u00bf\tRelease Containment/Control\r\n\u00bf\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\r\n\u00bf\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n\u00bf\tCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n\u00bf\tAtmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\u00bf\tFire extinguishers\r\n\u00bf\tTrained personnel\r\n\u00bf\tPersonal protective equipment\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Carbide Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the facility.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the ope"

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) scheduled preventive maintenance, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel will receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Scheduled preventive maintenance helps to ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or facility management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Carbide Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility has a system to manage changes to all covered processes.

This training is documented for each operator.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow facility safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional checks to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance fu"

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Carbide Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are readily available at the facility for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task(s).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Carbide Facility has a program in place to help ensure that hazards associated with the various stages within the process are identified and controlled.  Each process in this program is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe facility primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. \r\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.
