The facility is designed to remove liquids from natural gas by physical separation and dehydration methods.  Both petroleum condensates and produced fluids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas or field gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Carbide Facility because the facility handles and stores several EPA regulated flammable substances:  methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, isopentane and heptane.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the facility:\n\n\n\n1. Section 112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The gist of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to properly manage the situation.  Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Carbide Facility, as well as, all of its other operations.  Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC is committed to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors within the community.  The Carbide Facility, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness for our facility.\n\n\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The Carbide Facility removes natural gas liquids and produces pipeline quality natural gas.  This process involves the handling and storage of chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in Section 112(r).   Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nFor planning purposes, Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC has considered the impact of a \"worst case\" a"

      "SummaryText": "ccident.  Information gathered indicates that less than 10 persons live within the potential impact radius. It should be emphasized that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote - far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.  A consideration of the radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nEureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC also considered the impact of a more likely release.  This alternative release is characterized as an accident during a daily routine.  Using air modeling software, the impact distance of a potential explosion of the vapor cloud formed after this release was calculated to be 0.32 miles.  A limited number of off-site receptors, such as residences, roads and staging areas are located within this radius.  Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  The Carbide Facility has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures.  Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC provides annual emergency response training to its employees. In addition, Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC coordinates with local emergency responders including the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\nEureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC is committed to the following:\n\n- Preventing accidents;\n\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with the Carbide Facility operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the liquids removal and compression process.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Informa"

      "SummaryText": "tion\n\n\n\nThe Carbide Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments are assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  For specific liquid handling and compression areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and isolation systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the liquid handling and compression equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Carbide Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent "

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are readily available at the facility for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task(s).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Carbide Facility has a program in place to help ensure that hazards associated with the various stages within the process are identified and controlled.  Each process in this program is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe facility primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. \n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and find"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized above is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Carbide Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Carbide Facility has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n?    Release Containment/Control\n\n?    Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\n\n?    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n?    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n?    Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n?    Fire extinguishers\n\n?    Trained personnel\n\n?    Personal protective equipment\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Carbide Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the facility.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the ope"

This training is documented for each operator.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Carbide Facility uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow facility safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Eureka Hunter Pipeline, LLC evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Carbide Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional checks to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance fu"

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) scheduled preventive maintenance, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel will receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Scheduled preventive maintenance helps to ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or facility management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Carbide Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Carbide Facility has a system to manage changes to all covered processes.

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Carbide Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Carbide Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
