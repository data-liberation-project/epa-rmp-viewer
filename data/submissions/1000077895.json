The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Rinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological\n\nsafeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to\n\nImprove Safety\". The safeguards include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of Hydrochloric Acid 37%.\n\n1.4. The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Hydrochloric acid 37% or any other chemical at the Rinchem Company Inc, Chandler AZ Warehouse.\n\n1.5. The Emergency Action Program\n\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, Inc, Chandler, AZ Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of Hydrochloric acid 37% from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above mentioned materials. Rinchem has developed an emergency action program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Hydrochloric acid 37% to employees (vapor-dispersion modeling demonstrates no impact to public receptors). Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. The Chandler Warehouse Emergency Action Program consists of: Emergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan Chemical Exposure and Chemical Spill Cleanup Procedure Emergency Evacuation Plan The Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise. The Emergency action plan and documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that ma"
