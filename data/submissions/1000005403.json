The RMP is in accordance with the requirements set forth in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations 40 CFR Part 68. The PORTS plant is subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP requirements.\n\n2.0\tMANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION\n\nUSEC is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of workers and the public, and protects the environment.  In order to meet these commitments, USEC has issued an operations policy manual which states, in part:  USEC is ultimately responsible for, and is committed to safe operations, maintenance, design, fabrication, and testing of the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, and is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of workers and the public, protects the environment and provides for the common defense and security.\n\nProgram and staff organizations are established for safety, safeguards and quality, and environmental, safety, and health with sufficient resources to support the line organization in safe operation of the plant.\n\n3.0\tGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\n3.1\tFacility Description and Location\n\nThe gaseous diffusion plant facilities have been transitioned into cold shutdown (CSD) status.  Under CSD for DOE, USEC is deactivating equipment and removing lube oil, pyranol oils, and uranium deposit holdups in the process equipment in advance of eventual decontamination and decommissioning (D&D).

The site is generally in a rural area, and was previously farmland and the watershed for several intermittent streams.  PORTS occupies approximately 650 acres within the Controlled Access Area about 1.5 miles east of U.S. Route 23 and 2 miles south of State Route 32, and 2 miles east of the Scioto River.  The entire facility is owned by the United States Department of Energy (DOE).\n\nUSEC leases and operates a portion of the plant.  The portion of PORTS leased by USEC contains more than 120 buildings with a total floor space of about 14.2 million square feet.  Three large enrichment process buildings constitute approximately 38 percent of the plants' total floor space.  There are also cooling towers, electrical switchyards, and several support operations structures, including sewage and liquid effluent treatment plants, decontamination and recovery operations, coal and ash-handling facilities, water treatment facilities, steam plant, maintenance operations, laboratories, fluorine facilities, and air plants.\n\nBuildings, facilities and areas not leased by USEC are owned and operated by DOE.\n\nThis RMP applies only to facilities leased by USEC.\n\n3.2\tRegulated Substances\n\nChlorine, fluorine, and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride are the only substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130 which are present in quantities exceeding the threshold quantity.  Chlorine, fluorine, and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride are used in three separate processes and are managed in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 PSM program.\n\n3.3\tUse of Regulated Substances\n\n3.3.1\tProcess One - Chlorine\n\nRaw water is taken from well fields, treated and supplied to PORTS for numerous uses.

Raw water treatment takes place at the X-611 Water Treatment Plant which is located to the north of the plant.  The sanitary water treatment process is similar to other water treatment plants throughout the United States that use chlorine to disinfect the water for sanitary purposes. \n\nThe chlorine, provided in 1-ton cylinders, has a maximum administrative limit of three filled chlorine cylinders at any one time.  This quantity is in excess of the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.  A typical working inventory is two cylinders attached to the system manifold.  The third container, if present, would be in an unconnected storage position adjacent to the in-use cylinders.  All three container positions are inside a building with a vehicle door to accommodate deliveries. \n\n3.3.2\tProcess Two - Fluorine and Hydrogen Fluoride\n\nThe X-342 fluorine generation complex produces fluorine from HF.  The HF is received in 850 pound cylinders, with up to two cylinders connected to the fluorine generation system inside a heated cabinet within the X-342 building.  Additional cylinders are staged in a separate room (Process 3).  The HF is electrolytically disassociated into hydrogen, which is discharged to the atmosphere, and fluorine, which is stored in a set of tanks enclosed in a third room.  The fluorine is used as needed in the maintenance of the uranium enrichment equipment.\n\nThe X-342 fluorine complex has the potential to release up to 1,290 pounds of fluorine or 1,700 pounds of HF.  The HF has a physical limit of two filled cylinders (nominally 850 pounds of HF per container) in use.  The fluorine has an administrative limit of 1,290 pounds.

During the last RMP inspection, the senior inspector advised PORTS that the storage of the HF cylinders in a room adjacent to the fluorine generation needed to be considered a separate process.\n\nThe HF is received in 850 pound cylinders.  Additional cylinders are staged in a separate room from the fluorine generation process within the same building.  Individual cylinders are moved to the feed cabinet as needed.  The X-342 fluorine generation complex has an administrative limit of eight filled cylinders staged for use (including the two cylinders actually in use).  Stored cylinders, holding a maximum of 5,100 pounds (six cylinders in storage) of HF are adjacent to, but not connected to, each other.\n\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nPORTS five year history exhibits a chemical release performance of no significant or threshold quantity release of chlorine, fluorine, or HF.  Minor releases can occur during routine operations and maintenance activities, but have not resulted in significant personnel exposure or environmental impacts.\n\n5.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nUSEC has addressed release potentials and risks in safety analysis documents and by the use of management systems.  Details of these mitigative actions to ensure safe operating conditions can be found in \"Application For United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission Certification Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant Safety Analysis Report\" and in 29 CFR 1910.119 PHAs for the X-342 Fluorine Generation Complex and the X-611E Water Treatment Facility.\n\nThese site-level systems apply uniformly for the management of structures, systems, programs, and components that pertain to an RMP covered process and related activities.\n\n5.1\tSystems\n\nThe chlorine feed facility is equipped with container-mounted vacuum regulators which reduce the pressure of the chlorine from the vapor pressure"

Drills are held quarterly and involve decision-making and actions by participating personnel to simulate emergency conditions but do not involve offsite response personnel. \n\nAn exercise is a training session that tests the integrated capability of all or most of the basic elements existing within the emergency plan.  Exercises use scenarios that are wider in scope than drills and may involve offsite response personnel and agencies.  Plant personnel plan and conduct biennial exercises.\n\n6.6\tPublic Warning System\n\nThe public warning system, consisting of outdoor warning sirens and emergency alert systems announcements, is used to provide emergency notification.  Operations testing of the public warning system is conducted monthly.\n\n6.7\tCoordination With Off-site Organizations\n\nMutual aid agreements, memorandums of understanding, and letters of agreement have been entered into with offsite groups to provide assistance in the event of an emergency.

The Employee Participation Plan is applied by formal plant implementation procedures, e.g., reporting unsafe activities, emergency response expectations, and configuration management controls.\n\n\n\n\n8.0\tINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\nUSEC conducts incident and event investigations to protect employees, public health and safety, the environment, and national security interests.  Incident investigations are conducted in accordance with formal procedures.  If a large scale event were to occur, a special investigation team may be appointed to investigate the incident.  Appropriate notification of an incident is by the specific program management and regulatory requirements.  Notification is performed in accordance with formal procedures.\n\nAs part of this program, abnormal events are identified, reported, and investigated.  This includes identification, categorization of the event and analysis to determine the root cause and its effect. The corrective actions developed as a result of the investigation are entered into a commitment management database, which is a dedicated database used to track and trend corrective actions and plant commitments. This database also facilitates management's review of the corrective actions and plant commitment.\n\n9.0\tCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nThe Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) includes an audit system which was established for Quality and Augmented Quality items and other activities and services within the scope of the QAP.  The audit systems are in accordance with Basic Requirement 18 and Supplement 18S-1 of NQA-1 (1989).  This system establishes planned and periodic audits to verify the compliance and effectiveness of the QAP in meeting quality requirements.\n\nIndependent internal audits of selected aspects of operational activities are performed with a frequency commensurate with their safety significance and in a manner as to assure that audits of"

      "SummaryText": "activities within the scope of the QAP are completed within the specified time periods.  Audit reports are managed as described in the Recordkeeping and Document Control program descriptions found in other RMP sections.\n\nCorrective actions and issues resulting from audits, investigations, and regulatory sources are addressed by the Corrective Action management system discussed in this document.  These audits and any corrective actions are processed by existing plant programs that include RMP elements and requirements.\n\nThe most recent compliance audit was conducted by Ohio EPA personnel, under contract to the federal EPA.  The audit cited no violations of the RMP requirements, but advised PORTS to split the HF storage into a separate process from the fluorine generation at the next RMP update.  The senior auditor also advised PORTS to label empty HF cylinders in the same or nearby areas as \"EMPTY\" for the benefit of emergency responders.\n\n10.0\t  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nUSEC Government Services has applied for Voluntary Protection Program status and anticipates planning for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration onsite evaluation summer 2009."
