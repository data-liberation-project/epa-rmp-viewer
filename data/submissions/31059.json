Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nManagement of the Gold Kist South Carolina Division processing plant in Sumter (GK-Sumter) is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental protection.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program which includes equipment design and installation, operating and maintenance procedures and employee training.  Our employees implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, trained emergency response personnel are present to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Sumter Fire Department for additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nGK-Sumter is a poultry processing plant which uses one regulated substance, ammonia , in its operations.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to ensure wholesome products.  \n\n3.  The Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \nThis information is available for review at the facility.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe GK-Sumter facility is in compliance with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The refrigeration process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and  subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.   The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information-\nDetailed records of safety information which describe chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all operations are maintained at the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nPersonnel with engineering and processing expertise condu"
