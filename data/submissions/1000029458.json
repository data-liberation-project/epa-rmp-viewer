A key element of its protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\n\n\nIGM's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from Mecklenburg County emergency response organizations.    Although the facility's programs have been highly successful, it continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs.  \n\n\n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrophic effects (\"the worst case\") and a scenario of lesser magnitude (\"alternative case\").  Worst case scenario information is provided in this report to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to the lesser magnitude scenario, which is more likely to occur.\n\n\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using the RMP*Comp model.  RMP*Comp is an offsite consequence model jointly developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which follows the procedures set out in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance and industry-specific "

The Charlotte facility employs about 50 people.   \n\n\n\nThe manufacturing facilities of IGM are certified under the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of IGM Resins USA Inc. to prevent all releases of potentially harmful substances.  Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs and the facility has invested extensive time and resources in this effort.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has detailed procedures, which ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of each process.  Facility personnel receive regular safety training and employee input is solicited on every aspect of safety improvement. Failure to follow safety policies is grounds for dismissal.\n\n\n\nIf a release were to occur IGM Resins' personnel are only trained to respond to an incipient release to control and contain a small release.  The standard procedure is to technically evaluate each situation, identify potential on-site and off-site impacts, evacuate workers as necessary, contain the release if possible and contact the local fire department who are depended upon to provide the necessary emergency response services.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE \n\n\n\nIGM Resins USA Inc. is a chemical manufacturing facility located at 3300 Westinghouse Boulevard.  The facility operates a variety of processes to produce many specialty chemicals for the coatings and inks industry.

Collectively, these programs prevent accidental releases caused by equipment failure or human error.  Following is a summary of the general accident prevention program at the facility:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Charlotte facility understands that employee involvement is crucial to the success of an accident prevention program.  The facility aggressively encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, reviewing chemical safety information, and participating in process hazard analyses (PHAs).  Employees have access to extensive process and chemical safety information.  Employee involvement in safety programs is documented in the facility's Process Safety Manual.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nSafe operation of a process starts with a detailed identification of the hazards associated with the process.  The Charlotte facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with each process are identified and controlled.  To do this, each process at the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe facility prim"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of trained personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nPHA team findings are submitted to the plant manager for resolution.  Implementation of mitigating options in response to PHAs is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nIn order to operate a process safely, facility personnel need accurate, detailed information about the process and any associated hazards.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Refresher training for all operators is conducted every 3 years.  Each training program includes a method of verifying that the operator understood the training through verbal confirmation and written tests.  All training is documented.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n\n\n- perform their work in a safe manner, \n\n- have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \n\n- ar"

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR for any new process or process modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared before placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that process safety management and accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n\n\n- conducting training, \n\n- developing written procedures, \n\n- performing inspections and tests, \n\n- correcting identified deficiencies, and \n\n- applying quality assurance measures.  \n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel training includes an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service.  If the required parts or equipment are not available, an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment until the required deficiency can be corrected.  The equipment will not be placed back into service unless the MOC team can adequately address the modifications required for the safe operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that the new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Charlotte facility has long-standing safe work practices to ensure employee and process safety.  Examples of these include:\n\n\n\n- control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel,\n\n-  a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \n\n- a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened,\n\n- a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and \n\n- a permit and procedu"

To prevent such mistakes, the Charlotte facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with the necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a serious situation, e.g. a fire or explosion, a toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be impacted by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Charlotte facility is periodically"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as policies that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based upon modifications made to the facility processes or other facility changes.  The emergency response program changes includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the modifications.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Charlotte facility was submitted to the Mecklenburg County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
