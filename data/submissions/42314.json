Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage.\nLykes Meat Group's safety programs are applied to all activitiesss involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the onsite movement of chemicals.  Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazard chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a singel process.\nLykes Meat Group's prevents accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures , and best practices which govern processes, activites, and or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and revies as necessary.  All information is communicated to employesss of Lykes Meat Group, Inc. through training and documentation.\nIn Worst Case Scenario, failure of the high pressure reciever under worst case weather conditions would release approximately 12,623 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minutes period.
