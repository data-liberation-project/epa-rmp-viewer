      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Gold Signature Foods, LLC frozen speciality foods facility at Monroe, North Carolina.  The facility refrigeration process consists of a single-stage refrigeration system (system #2) and a two-stage refrigeration system (system #1) using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.\n\nSystem #2 uses approximately 5,000 pounds of ammonia and is below the threshold quantity requirements.  System #1 uses approximately 12,000 pounds.  The two systems are located on opposite sides of the facility.  Even though we are not required by law to hold system #2 to the same standards, we are following most aspects of the regulations in order to enhance the overall safety of the system.\n\nA speculative offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as worst-case scenario and alternative release scenario.  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ...maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated for the Gold Signature Foods, LLC Monroe Facility has an endpoint distance of approximately 500 feet.  The Gold Signature Facility is located in an industrial area with minimal residential population for"

This plan inculdes emergency alarm, posted facility evacuation exit routing, emergency response drills and evaluation, and local Public Safety notification procedures.  The facility also has Security Officers on site at all times, including weekends and holidays.\n\nGold Signature Foods, LLC is a minority-owned facility which specializes in the manufacturing and marketing of frozen speciality foods.
