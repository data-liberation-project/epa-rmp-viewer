      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Rio Bravo Rocklin facility uses anhydrous ammonia to help maintain air quality compliance of the emission stack, specifically, reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions.  Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of Rio Bravo Rocklin to conduct all operations (including the ammonia thermal DeNOx system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Rio Bravo Rocklin implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nGeneral Overview\n\n\n\nThe Rio Bravo Rocklin facility utilizes ammonia in the Thermal DeNOx system installed on the Combustion Engineering circulating fluidized bed combustor which processes biomass for generating steam.  Biomass fuel is charged to the boiler and is combusted in the fluidized bed. Particulate laden flue gases travel upward through the combustion chamber.  At the top, the flue gases flow into a cyclone and the cleaner flue gases exit overhead.  Ammonia is injected into the outlet flue gas piping downstream of the cyclone.\n\n\n\nThe DeNOX process occurs in a specific temperature range with the ammonia mixing with the flue gas and reacting with the NOx. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the reducing agent.  \n\n\n\nFacility Details\n\n\n\nThe ammonia injection system uses approximately 200 tons of ammonia annually for the thermal DeNOx system at Rio Bravo Rocklin. \n\n\n\nThe system involves the storage and va"

      "SummaryText": "porization of liquid ammonia, and injection of the vaporized ammonia into the boiler through injection points (nozzles) to facilitate mixing with the flue gas. \n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia is brought onsite by trucks complete with an on board ammonia vapor compressor that transfers the ammonia to the ammonia storage tank.  The liquid ammonia is stored in a horizontal ammonia storage tank with a 12,000 gallon capacity.  The facility keeps the vessel filled to approximately 85% capacity.  \n\n \n\nTo ensure that an adequate supply of ammonia vapor is available for the process, a vaporizer may be utilized.  The vaporizer is located at an elevation lower than the bottom of the ammonia storage tank so it can be gravity filled with liquid ammonia.  The purpose of the vaporizer is to maintain the vapor pressure in the storage tank above 45 psig, which is the vapor pressure of liquid ammonia at 30?F.  Due to the large surface area of the storage tank, heat input to the system from the vaporizer is normally unnecessary except during times of low ambient temperature.\n\n\n\nAmmonia vapor from the head space of the tank is directly injected into the boiler for the thermal DeNOx process. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the Thermal DeNOx system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n-EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\n-California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). \n\n\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The ammonia system employed by the Rio Bravo Rocklin facility is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.  This monitoring system is comprised of pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for"

The detector is located above the Storage Tank.  The detector has a high level alarm set at 15 ppm and a high high level alarm set at 25 ppm. The detector alarms in the Control Room. At high high level, the control valves on the Storage Tank are automatically closed. Facility personnel will investigate the cause of the High High alarm on the ammonia sensor to determine the next action(s) to be taken, which may include any or all of the following: close valve(s), repair sensor(s), and, facility evacuation. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\n\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nRio Bravo's Five Year Accident History was reviewed during the PHA Revalidation on July 20, 2017.

This EAP was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n-save lives;\n\n-minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n-protect the environment; and\n\n-minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe EAP provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.

In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Control Room Operator.  The Control Room Operator will contact the Plant Manager to evaluate and ascertain the significance of the leak.  If the ammonia leak is considered minor and/or minimal, the repair will be conducted by the Rio Bravo Rocklin maintenance staff.  An outside contractor may be contacted to further assist in the potential repairs to the equipment pertaining to the ammonia system.  For major ammonia leaks, emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.

The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Rio Bravo Rocklin safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2.
