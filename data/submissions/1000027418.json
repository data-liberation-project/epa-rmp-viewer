Our facility is located at 1504 Roseport Road - Elwood, KS  66024.  The toxic chemical that is stored witin our facility is gas chlorine in 150#cylinders.  The most that is stored at any given point is 90 cylinders or 13,500#'s.  We are dedicated to the\r\nsafety our our employees and our community, as well as those communities we service.  We are continually training our staff on the proper procedures and protocol for handling chemicals.  \r\nWe have built a new facility and have requested onsite visits from Kansas Department of Labor Relations for an OSHA review - Fire Department - Police Department and just had a full audit of policies and procedures including Hazardous Material Training from DOT and no violations were determined to exist. \r\n\r\nOur Reglatory/Safety Compliance Manager is an active member in the LEPC and MERC committees. \r\n\r\nWe welcome and have had an unscheduled on-site inspection by our insurance carrier. We are proud that during these consultations no major itmes were noted and that all suggestions by these agencies have been put into place, with proper training given to our staff.  A site hazard assessment was completed on March 1, 2012 and noted items have been addressed and/or corrected.  The management of Edwards Chemicals, Inc. is dedicated to the safety programs instituited by our Safety Manager, and management is apprised of all\r\nsafety issues at weekly management meetings. In the event of a gas chlorine release on-site, we have been\r\nlisted in the Buchanan County LEPC emergency plan and have trained our staff how to detect a leak and how trained hw to evacuate the builidng and contact the LEPC as well as our emergency response contractor Haz-Mat Response,"

      "SummaryText": "Inc..  Although not required we have developed and implemented an emergency response program, to ensure that all staff members are trained and knowledgeable in the proper steps to take in the event of a release.  In the event of an off-site release the drivers have been trained in how to\r\ncontact the appropriate agencies, secure the area and contact our emergency response contractor, our inside staff has also been trained on the proper procedures if this situation occurs.  Post 9-11, we have also instituted many additonal security measures, such as a daily cylinder inventory report,  training for our staff on how to recognize any strange behavior by persons  who may be targeting our warehouse and/or our cargo during deliveries off-site, we have also d trained our staff on how to notify the proper authorities in the event\r\nof a security breech on or off-stie. \r\n\r\nOur facility now has a fence around the entire facility with a security gate - we have also installed a security system with 24 hour camera monitoring. In our hazard assessment, we determined that it would enhance our security to move the storage location of the gas chlrone cylinders and to make a more secure area to store them in the facility, which we have done.  We have installed global positioning satillte systems on our delivery trucks to be able to rapidly identify and locate a vehicle in the event of its theft, or a reported\r\nsuspicous activity.  We have assigned all of our drivers, warehouse staff and management with celluar phones so they could immediately notify appropriate persons in the event of a chemical release, security breech or any other necessary reason for contact.  \r\n\r\nAn additional concern would be a fire in the facility and cylinders and acids being exposed to high temperatures thus rleasing a chlorine vapor gas or toxic gases  As previously noted we have requested and received an on-site consultation from the Fire Marshall and have developed a \"grab and go\" file containing all relati"

We have also prepared a file that our drivers carry with them daily that includes relevant MSDS, emergency contact information and emergency procedures.  The most likely release of gas chlorine would come from a gas chlorine cylinder being dropped while being loaded\r\nonto our delivery vehicles or while delivering to a client.  Through our on-site consultations and hazard assessments we have developed a compreshensive plan covering all seniros related to the distribuiton of gas chlorine including the steps to be taken in the event of a valve stem being broken and a release of gas chlorine occuring.  Although we will not respond to this occurance, we have as mentioned trained our staff on how to prevent this occurance, recoginize this occurance and how to evacuate the premisis whether on or\r\noff-site and how to contact the proper agencies and responders.   Edwards Chemicals, Inc. is constantly looking for available information on how to better train, prepare and educate our employees.  In this vain we have a full time Safety Manager,who keeps updated on the new standards pertaining to the proper storage and handling of chlorine, as well as a safety committee that is includes all areas of our staff. \r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid is distribuited to water treatment facilities, swimming pools and industrial facilities.\r\nHydrochloric acid is onsite in 1 gallon containers, 15 gallon carboys, 54 gallon drums and 250 gallon totes, and soon we will have a 5000 gallon bulk tank - date of installation is scheduled no later than April 30th, 2012.\r\n\r\nEdwards Chemicals, works with the local LEPC as well as the local fire department to advise of all products stored in the facility, as stated with the gas chlorine Edwards Chemicals does not respond to large spills and would contact the fire department hazardous materials division to handle a large spill or worst case"
