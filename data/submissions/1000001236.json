      "SummaryText": "Central Davis Sewer Distict has developed this risk management plan in order to provide for the possibility that an accidental release of chlorine liquid/gas may occur into the environment of it's wastewater treatment plant.   The District considers the release of a significant quantity of gas remote due to the aprroximate 40 years of successful operation.  This analysis indicates a worst case scenerio radius to the toxic end point of 0.9 miles.  For the alternative case, the toxic end point is 0.3 miles.   The District has developed standard operating procedures for chlorine handling and emergency response.  The District has an effective process safety management program which has been in place for about 15 years.   The District has established a hazardous response team to respond to a site toxic release of chlorine.  The actions of this team are coordinated with the Kaysville City Fire Department.   The City Fire Department will act as offsite coordinators and energency rescue team for any chlorine release emergency.  The District has appropriate hazmat equipment and all members of the team are certified in respiratory protection and hazmat technician procedures.  The hazmat team drills approximately twice a year.  The District is confident that appropriate actions have been taken to prevent an accidental release and is prepared with appropriately trained staff should an unlikely release occur."
