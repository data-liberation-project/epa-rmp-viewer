The simulation calculated that 21,267 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.
