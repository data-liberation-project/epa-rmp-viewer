Our safety, health, and environmental policy calls for a\n\ncommitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding\n\nenvironment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and\n\nprocess systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs\n\nthat ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these\n\nprograms.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of\n\nResponsible Care Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule,\n\nthe Sinton, Texas facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.
