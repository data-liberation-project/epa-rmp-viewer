The outlet stream consists of acrolein, unreacted propylene and oxygen, nitrogen, steam, and small amounts of by-products.  The acrolein is separated from the other materials in the stream through a series of two quench columns, a stripper, and two distillation columns.   The final product is to be stored in each of three 1,000 gallon vessels.  This product will ultimately be transfered to the acrolein repackaging plant. \n\nA 16.3 MM Btu / hr thermal oxidizer is used to control emissions associated with the facility's process vents and polymerized streams.   Nearly 80% of the facility's steam requirements are produced in an unfired heat recovery steam generator that recovers heat from the facility's thermal oxidizer.   Recovering heat generated by the acrolein production reaction produces the remainder of the steam required.\t\t \n\nOff-site and utility systems to support the process plant include propylene storage in railcars, reaction inhibitor makeup and storage, water systems, cooling water, chilled water system, instrument air, emergency power, and an emergency flare system.\n\nCompliance Audits - Taft Manufacturing Company conducts internal audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits of RMP covered processes are conducted at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are initiated in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation - Taft Manufacturing Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reocurring.  All reports are maintained for a minimum of 5"

The alternative release scenario for acrolein was prepared based on the Safer System Trace Model.  The scenario involves the release of 2,450 pounds at the rate of 40.8 pounds per minute over a time period of 60 minutes.  (The maximum net weight of a skid is 2,450 pounds, but allowance is made for fluctuation in actual contents, polymerization of contents upon release to an ambient atmosphere, etc.).  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes were not used as such controls would not apply to a vapor release.  At D atmospheric stability and 3.0 meters /sec windspeed, with urban topography, the projected distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L is 6.3 miles.   \n\nWorst Case Scenario for Propylene\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario submitted for flammable substances involves the catastrophic release of propylene.  We have used the computer model RMP Comp Ver. 1.07. provided by the U.S. EPA.  The scenario involves the release of 40,000 gallons or 173,600 lbs of propylene as a vapor cloud.    Passive mitigation controls such as dikes were not used, as this feature would be ineffective for vapor release.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters / sec windspeed, with urban topography, the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.4 miles according to RMP Comp.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario for Propylene\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario submitted for flammable substances involves the catastrophic release of propylene.

This committment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our emergency repsonse personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacture and transfer of Acrolein, a chemical used in oilfield and agricultural applications from bulk containers into transfer and shipping / dispenser containers, with attendant rework and service of the containers.\n\nAcrolein is used as a pesticide.\n\nA raw material used in the acrolein manufacturing process is propylene.  Propylene is to be received in railcars for use in the chemical process.\n\n3. Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario are as follows:\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario for Acrolein \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario submitted for toxic substances involves a catastrophic release of acrolein.  We have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the U.S. EPA in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA).  The scenario involves the release of 35,000 lbs of acrolein (from an ISO container) as a liquid spill / vapor release over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes were not used, as this feature would be ineffective for gas release.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters / sec windspeed, with urban topography, the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L is 25 miles according to Reference Table 7 of the OCA Gui"

Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company Acrolein Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of all affected areas.\n\nThe plant has recently installed acrolein detectors around the perimeter of the plant, at the new acrolein product storage tanks, and at the base of the process area to measure ambient acrolein.  Additionally, lower explosive limit detectors are installed around the thermal oxidizer, reactor, and around the propylene railcar staging area.  The data from the detectors is sent to the continually-occupied control room where the operator is notified of alarm conditions.   Also, an automatic foam deluge system will be activated at the acrolein product storage tanks, to apply alchohol fire fighting foam (AFFF) in the containment area.   An automatic water deluge sytsem will be activated at the proylene storage area, to apply water to the propylene railcars.  Additionally, fire monitors can be used to apply water or AFFF to any part of the process area.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of loss control audits, excess flow prevention controls were installed on each of the two unloading platforms for our bulk acrolein unloading stations."
