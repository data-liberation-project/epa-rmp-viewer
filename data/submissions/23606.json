The sulfur dioxide is then converted to sulfur trioxide and mixed with water to produce sulfuric acid. In turn, the sulfuric acid is reacted with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is then reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce the mono- and diammonium phosphates.\n\nRegulated toxic substances involved in this process include: anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide. However, anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated toxic substance that exceeds the threshold planning quantity (i.e., 10,000 pounds) in the process. As sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide are fully consumed as intermediates in the production process, they are not present in quantities in the process that exceed their applicable threshold planning quantities.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in four aboveground interconnected horizontal cylindrical pressurized storage vessels at the New Wales plant. The anhydrous ammonia is received at the New Wales plant via a commercial pipeline.\n\n3. Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the New Wales Plant is the loss of the entire contents as a gas of a single anhydrous ammonia storage vessel over a period of ten minutes. No liquid pooling was considered to occur during the release of the anhydrous ammonia which is liquefied in the storage vessel by pressure. Administrative controls limit the storage of anhydrous ammonia in the vessel to 85% of the vessel's capacity. Computer modeling was used to predict the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L and was determined to have off-site impacts. A computer dispersion model, DEGADIS, was selected for the worst case scenario because of its ability to calculate dense gas concentrations and predict plume dispersion behavior. However, this worst case release scenario is unlikely to occur based on the material properties of the liquefied a"

Most of these scenarios did not result in offsite impacts. The alternative release scenario resulting in the farthest distance to the toxic endpoint involved the release of the entire contents of one pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage vessel due to a tank rupture. All of the anhydrous ammonia vapor and half of the liquefied anhydrous ammonia when released from the vessel forms a two-phase (i.e., vapor with entrained liquid droplets) hemispherical cloud which begins dispersing downwind immediately. The release duration was calculated to be forty--seven minutes. The remaining liquid anhydrous ammonia forms a pool on the ground at the base of the vessel which then evaporates under weather conditions representative of the nearest average Tampa area meteorological station. Administrative controls limit the quantity of the stored anhydrous ammonia to 85% of the vessel's capacity. Check valves and excess flow valves were considered active mitigation in determining the quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario. Computer dispersion modeling, again using DEGADIS, predicted the distance to the 0.14 mg/L toxic endpoint to have offsite impacts.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Based on the quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the New Wales plant, the New Wales plant is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, and therefore, New Wales plant satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP. The New Wales Plant has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. A brief summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\nThe PSM program at the New"

The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the anhydrous ammonia system was completed in 1994 and a revalidation was completed in 1998. All action items generated as a result of the revalidation have been completed.  The ammonia storage system was upgraded to meet applicable nationally recognized codes and standards. The ammonia feed system to the granulation plants was carefully analyzed and II action items were resolved. \n\nThe New Wales Process Safety Review Committee meets once a month to ensure the implementation and continuation of the entire PSM program. This includes writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures; training for all operators and maintenance personnel; reviewing mechanical integrity, quality assurance, and management of change programs; contractor safety programs; plus developing an audit schedule which meet all OSHA PSM standard requirements.\n\n5. Five -Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage` Since June 1, 1996 the New Wales Plant has had no accidental releases which meet the above criteria. \n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe New Wales Plant has an emergency response program in place to address foreseeable emergency situations and incidents involving all hazardous substances. The Emergency Response Plan establishes a mechanism for providing hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, external emergency response agencies, and the community. The New Wales Emergency Response Program contains procedures for notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency response agenc"

The New Wales Plant has defined an emergency as a non-routine, unusual set of circumstances that call for immediate safety or environmental action. The New Wales Plant also has an Emergency Action Team on each shift that conducts training and practice drills with county emergency personnel. This team is provided with appropriate personal and mitigation equipment to handle plant emergencies.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe New Wales Plant is working to timely resolve all action items generated as a result of internal audits and process hazard analysis. Although all previous incidents have been thoroughly investigated, the New Wales Plant is also evaluating the use of root cause investigation and analysis techniques to enhance the plant's ability to prevent recurrence of incidents."
