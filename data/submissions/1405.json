(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Port Wentworth, GA.  The facility is located on Crossgate Road. The resin facility consists of a plant that was originally constructed in 1974.  Overall, the facility employs 48 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Port Wentworth, Georgia plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Port Wentworth Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Port Wentworth Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Port Wentworth Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Port Wentworth Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n \n7 an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation further describing these eleme"

In fact, the Port Wentworth Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Cont)\n\n\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Port Wentworth Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Port Wentworth Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Port Wentworth Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, an"

GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Production Superintendent to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\n \n\n\n1.

The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  GPRI does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Port Wentworth Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences "

Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n \n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Port Wentworth Plant:\n\n1.3.1 Program 3 Processes-Toxic Substances - Formaldehyde Solutions\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the release of the entire contents of   47,875 lbs of pure formaldehydefrom a resin manufacturing kettle .

The U.S. Census indicates that 27 people live within this distance from the storage tank;  one public receptor is- also located within this distance.  No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\n\n \n\n\n1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Cont)\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince 1992, the Port Wentworth Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:\n\nProgram 3essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nProgram 2requires simplified versions of 7 of the 12 elements of the Program 3 prevention program (not applicable for Port Wentworth Plant)\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Port Wentworth Plants Program 3 prevention program that address EPAs RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Port Wentworth Plants Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.4.1.1 Process Safety Information-the Port Wentworth Plant maintains a  variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes.

These PHAs help to identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the what-if checklist technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.
