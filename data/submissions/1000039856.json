This document has been\r\nprepared to satisfy multiple regulations and is governed by the following agencies:\r\n1. OSHA's Code of Regulations, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly\r\nHazardous Chemicals (PSM)\r\n2. Federal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\r\nRequirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3\r\nRequirements (RMP)\r\nThe purpose of this document is to:\r\n1. Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring\r\nproper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\r\n2. Assist Merchants Terminal and local government agencies in their communication and\r\ncoordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\r\nThis document addresses Merchants Terminal administrative and operational programs to prevent\r\naccidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks. The regulated substance of\r\nconcern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration\r\nfor warehouse cold storage and dock operations.\r\nThis Executive Summary contains tables outlining the PSM/RMP sections. It includes the purpose,\r\nfrequency of use, responsibilities and requirements, and forms for each section of the PSM/RMP\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\nMerchants Terminal operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary\r\nrefrigerant.

The refrigeration cycle\r\nconsists of evaporation, compression, condensation, and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are\r\ndesigned to alter the quantity of energy associated with refrigerant. Compression and expansion are\r\ndesigned to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed-loop\r\nprocess. The ammonia refrigeration cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of\r\nvaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system utilizes these phenomenons to remove heat from a\r\ndesired area, and then to discard that heat, through condensation, to an area where it is of no\r\nconsequence.\r\nThe Merchants Terminal facility utilizes ammonia refrigeration to cool various storage areas. The\r\nrefrigeration system contains the following equipment: nine screw compressors, three evaporative\r\ncondensers, one -43\u00b0F recirculator with pumps, one -25\u00b0F recirculator with pumps, one high pressure\r\nreceiver, one thermosyphon receiver, six blast cells evaporators, four minus -20\u00b0F penthouse evaporators,\r\neighteen -10\u00b0F penthouse evaporators, two cooler penthouse evaporators, and eight dock evaporators.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\nEvery section of the RMP/PSM program must allow for employee participation in its development and\r\nimplementation. The plan allowing for this participation must be documented.
