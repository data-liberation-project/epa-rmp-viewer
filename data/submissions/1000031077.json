The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Enterprises and the employees of the AGChoice Ammonia Plant in Osage City are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Osage City Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient as well as dry fertilizer and grain.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nWe are currently upgrading the facility to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1999\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the Kansas Fertilizer Law.\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has;\n\n\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n\n       required unde"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. Currently the facility is evaluating the requirements of CGA 2.1, 2014 and Process Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and will make the required upgrades needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    10/12/12\n\n\n\n"
