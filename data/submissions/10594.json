Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.                                                            To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Inc., New Holland, Pa., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Inc., New Holland, Pa., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n     Ammonia:     We have (2) High Pressure receivers located in each plant (fresh & further processing), containing a total amount of anhydrous ammonia equaling 100,000 pounds. \n     \n     Propane:     We have (2) Propane storage tanks located in each plant (fresh & further processing), containing a total amount of propane equaling 51,000 gallons.\n\n                                                       \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\n Worst-case scenario - Failure of high-pressure receiver when full releasing 56,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high-pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high-pressure receiver.  The loss of 56,000 pounds of ammonia will have a dist"

The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high-pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had one release in the past 5 years of this type.\nAlternative release scenario ii.  Overpressure situation releasing 120 lbs of propane with a distance of .07 miles to lower flammability limit.\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations' Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  For chlorine systems Tyson Foods Inc. has adopted the Chlorine Institute guidelines for chlorine use. \n \n5.  Five-year accident history.\nPLEASE REFER TO REPORT IN SECTION 2 (HAZARD ASSESSMENT, SUBPART FIVE-YEAR HISTORY)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.
