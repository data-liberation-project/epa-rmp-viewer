The process consists of a 21,000 pound tube trailer provided by the chemical manufacturer and two, 400-liter Y-cylinders (\"tonners\") as well as associated gas cabinets, valve manifold boxes, piping, valves, and controls.   The tube trailer and tonners are stored in a secured outdoor area northwest of the northwest corner of the South Building.\n\nAs anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride is also regulated under OSHA's PSM Standard, TI has completed a Program 3 prevention program to comply with the RMP rule.\n\nThis RMP includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of a worst-case accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and emergency planning. \n\nThe \"number of fulltime equivalent employees on site\" listed under Section 1 - Registration Information comprises the South Building only.

TI also has restrictions and standards related to chemicals incorporated into supplier contracts.\n\nIf concerns about a chemical or other material arise during review, the matter is elevated to a chemical and material review board staffed by company experts. If a chemical or material is thought to be necessary for manufacturing but still raises concerns, the company's manufacturing leaders review the issue; where appropriate, they authorize additional time and resources to seek a safer alternative, or implement more stringent use controls. \n\n\n\nChemical-use policy and practices:\n\nTI is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations for chemical use.
