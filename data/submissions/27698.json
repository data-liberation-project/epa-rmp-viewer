The facility is an 844-MW electric generating station consisting of three natural gas-fired turbines.  A Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system are associated with each of the gas turbines.  The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is an approximately 30% solution of ammonia in water.\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at Choctaw County Generation Station is comprised of one storage tank, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The tank has a capacity of 30,000 gallons.  The tank is equipped with a pressure relief/vacuum breaker valve, as well as pressure and level indicators.  \n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) prepared in support of this RMP utilized the methodologies recommended by EPA and employed in the RMP*Comp, Version 1.07 modeling system.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (WCS) considered the catastrophic rupture of the aqueous ammonia storage tank, in which the entire contents of the tank are released within the secondary containment dike.  The secondary containment dike is large enough to contain the "

      "SummaryText": "entire volume and limits the exposed surface area of a pool, which reduces the release rate.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions of 1.5 m/s wind speed and atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), the resulting ammonia cloud could travel 0.5 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a health hazard to the public.  This worst-case impact distance extends offsite of the Choctaw County Generation Station and impacts offsite residences, recreational areas, seasonal hunting lease areas, and small industrial areas.  The WCS does not impact any offsite institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), major commercial areas, or environmental receptors.\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios (ARSs) were considered including releases due to a failed delivery hose, a failed pipe between the ammonia transfer pumps and the header for the ammonia flow control skids (AFCS), a failed pipe between the AFCS header and a vaporizer, and a corrosion-caused hole in piping.  The release due to a failed delivery hose resulted in the farthest impact distance (0.3 miles) and is the ARS presented in this RMP.  The impact due to the ARS extends offsite of the Choctaw County Generation Station facility and impacts offsite recreational areas and seasonal hunting lease areas. The ARS does not impact any offsite residences, institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), major commercial areas, or environmental receptors.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nA five-year accident history is not applicable, since this is a new process at the facility that has yet to commence operations.\n\nSummary of Prevention Program 2\n\nChoctaw County Generation Station is covered by an accidental release prevention program, which includes the following:\n ?Periodic hazard review and updates\n ?Periodic audits of the system and its operation\n ?Emergency response plan coordinated with local responding agencies\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the foll"

Choctaw County Generation Station employees have been trained in this plan and would be the first responders in the event of an emergency. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Choctaw County Generation Station was conducted as part of this RMP.  This is a new process, and there are not any planned changes to the system at this time."
