      "SummaryText": "THE WATER PRODUCTION PLANT WAS ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED IN 1963. A MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN MID 1999 ADDED MEMBRANE FILTRATION TECHNOLOGY, NEW FEED EQUIPMENT, AND A NEW LOW-LIFT PUMPING STATION FOR INCOMING RAW WATER. ADDITIONALLY, A NEW HIGH -LIFT PUMPING STATION AND 2.5 MILLION GALLON TREATED WATER RESERVOIR FOR PUMPINMG TREATED WATER WAS CONSTRUCTED IN 1999 AS WELL. THE PLANT HAS AN AVERAGE DAILY FLOW OF 12 MGD WITH A DAILY MAXIMUM DESIGN CAPACITY OF 40 MGD. THE PLANT USES CHLORINE SUPPLIED IN 1-TON CYLINDERS TO TREAT INCOMING WATER FROM LAKE MICHIGAN WITH CHLORINE AS A DISINFECTING AGENT PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION INTO THE PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM. CHLORINE IS AUTOMATICALLY METERED INTO THE WATER BY AUTOMATED PROCESS EQUIPMENT. A CHLORINE MONITORING AND ALARM SYSTEM IS INSTALLED IN THE ENCLOSED ROOM WHERE THESE CYLINDERS ARE USED AND STORED. ADDITIONAL HALOGEN SHUT-OFF VALVES ARE INSTALLED ON THE CYLINDER(S) IN USE WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHUT-OFF THE FLOW OF CHLORINE GAS IN THE EVENT A RELEASE IS DETECTED BY THE CHLORINE MONITORING SYSTEM."
