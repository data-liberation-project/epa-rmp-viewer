A revision to a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) done on August 7, 2006, by the prior owner of the facility, should have triggered an update within six months of the change, pursuant to 40 CFR ? 68.190(5);\n\n? The last training dates noted for the process units had not been updated by the previous owner.\n\nThis update addresses the issues noted above.  In addition, the nine sections of the plan were reviewed and verified. The bulk of the changes are in Section 7, Prevention Program 3. The changes in this section reflect recent FHR efforts to immediately address deficiencies in the facility?s PSM program by conducting a safety turnaround that focused on emergency response procedures and training. No changes have occurred that affect sections 1-5. Three recent incidents, a flaring event in the Olefins plant due to a broken cooling tower supply line and two small reactor fires in the polyethylene plant were added because they involved significant (greater than $25K) on-site property damage. Section 9 was changed to reflect the improvements to the emergency response plan and training resulting from the safety turnaround.  Flint Hills Resources, LP (FHR) purchased the Odessa Facility in an asset purchase on August 1, 2007.\n\nElements Descriptions\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: FHR Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors. Since purchasing the facility in an asset purchase on August 1, 2007, FHR?s focus has been on safety and environmental compliance.

FHR plans to make the required updates and improve the system for PSI maintenance.   \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA process hazards analysis (PHA) that identifies potential hazards, adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls, and ways to minimize those hazards is available for each covered process.  The PHAs on file are mostly Hazards and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) and ?What If?, a structured brainstorming method of determining what things can go wrong and judging the likelihood and consequences of those situations occurring,  performed by third parties prior to FHR?s ownership. FHR is currently using the most recent PHA date for each covered process to establish revalidation schedules.  FHR intends to improve the quality of the PHAs in the areas of documenting and considering past incidents and human factors.\n\nThe Odessa site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the process HAZOP methodology and the specific expertise as required.  FHR plans to improve procedures and policies to assure the proper people are assigned to each PHA team. \n\nThe HAZOP team will continue to develop recommendations to reduce the potential hazards.  FHR is implementing an effective tracking system to assure that the approved HAZOP team recommendations will be implemented within a reasonable period of time. \n\nOperating Procedures\nThe FHR Odessa facility?s policy is to maintain written operating procedures that were developed with operator participation and provide clear instruction for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process. FHR expectations for operating procedures is that the procedures address steps for the various operating phases, safety systems and their function, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards; and, that the procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and c"

Five Year Accident History\nThe facility has had four reportable incidents for the five-year accident history. \n- On March 16, 2004, there was a release of a flammable gas mixture from an underground storage well. For reporting purposes, the release was quantified over a four-day period. For emergency response purposes, the release was only six hours in duration. The initial response for the incident included the closure of several major roads in the immediate area. There were no on-site or off-site injuries or deaths. \n- On September 2, 2005, there was a piping rupture due to elevated temperatures and pressures directly related to ethylene decomposition inside the discharge piping of Cold Shot Compressors C-165 A/B. Area personnel activated the Emergency Shutdown Device and Emergency Response personnel were called to secure the area. There were no off-site consequences resulting in deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place warnings, property damage, or environmental impact. \n- On December 19, 2005 at approximately 5:50 AM, an employee received 2nd degree cryogenic burns to the abdomen area after opening the truck liquid valve prior to connecting unloading hose on a Propane/Propylene transport truck. \n- On July 25th, 2006 at approximately 2:28 PM, a ?? nipple on a bleed valve on an incoming feedstock supply line was severed by a forklift transporting media to the C4 carbon filter (D8.0917R1), resulting in the release of approximately 27,983 lbs of Y-Grade (Flammable Mixture) to the atmosphere.\n- "

The failure occurred above grade at a set of flanges, in a vertically oriented pipe, approximately 200 feet west of the East Cooling Tower.  In this area the supply line transitions from carbon steel to polyethylene (PE) pipe. This event resulted in releases to both air (via the air and steam flares) and surface waters (via the storm water system). This event resulted in releases to both air (via the air and steam flares) and surface waters (via the storm water system). The cause of this failure was fatigue due to severe piping stress resulting from extreme misalignment.\n- On January 19, 2008 at 7:45 PM a fire occurred at the polyethylene unit ?G? reactor recycle intermediate knock-out pot (V-281G) The reactor was shut down and the fire was extinguished at 8:15 PM by Operations personnel. The fire appeared to start under the insulation and the fuel source was a waxy polymer build-up from a rupture disk vent pipes. It is suspected that the temperature of the steam jacket was sufficient to ignite the wax/polymer mixture.\n- On January 24, 2008 at 7:33 PM. a fire occurred in the polyethylene unit ?B? reactor bay. The reactor was shut down and Operations personnel extinguished the fire at approximately 8:05 PM.A ?cold gas?
