As part of this commitment, AEIII has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility in Irvine, California. \n\nOne component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Bowerman Landfill Gas Processing Facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPAs) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at AEIII?s Bowerman Landfill Gas Processing Facility.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\n\nThe risk management program at the Bowerman Landfill Gas Processing Facility consists of three elements:\n\n1.A hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and accidents that are more likely to occur at the facility.\n\n2.A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance, in our case, Methane.\n\n3.An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nApollo Energy III is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes in the gas processing facility; and programs to continuously evaluate the hazards at the Bowerman gas processing facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Apollo Energy III controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  Although the local fire department, the Orange County Fire Authority, is the designated first responder to the Bowerman Landfill Gas Processing Facility, Apollo Energy III provides response training to its employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities until the fire department takes over, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  The Orange County Fire Authority is staffed with certified firemen and is manned 24 hours per day.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, AEIII has established a management system headed by the Vice President of Operations to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\nFacility Information and Regulated Substances\nApollo Energy III operates a landfill gas to liquid natural gas processing facility that employs approximately 2 full-time workers.  The gas processing produces approximately 5,000 gallons per day of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  The LNG produced at the facility consists of 97% methane and is stored in an above ground storage tank with a capacity to hold 25,000 gallons.  However, administrative and engineering controls maintain that the maximum amount of LNG in the storage tank at any point is 22,500 gallons.  The LNG from the storage tank is transported off site in tanker trucks that fill up at the LNG Truck Loading station. According to 40 CFR 68, facilities with acutely hazar"

The LNG storage tank stores up to but no more than 22,500 gallons of LNG, which equates to approximately 80,500 pounds of methane, a flammable material.  The regulatory threshold for methane is 10,000 pounds.  The LNG Storage and Truck Loading process is a Program Level 3 process.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Bowerman Landfill Gas Processing Facility complies with both the Federal and State Chemical Accident Prevention Program provisions as well as OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulations and as such, has developed procedures and policies that address the following:\n\n?Maintaining process safety information to document physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the gas processing facility and the design basis and safe operating parameters for equipment at the facility.\n\n?Performing process hazard analyses to help identify potential process hazards and to generate recommendations and action plans to improve safe operations.\n\n?Defining safe operating procedures.\n\n?Training of workers to safely and effectively perform assigned tasks.\n\n?Inspecting and testing to assess equipment mechanical integrity.\n\n?Managing change to ensure that change does not negatively affect safe operations.\n\n?Performing pre-startup safety reviews of new or modified processes.\n\n?Conducting compliance audits to be certain that safety programs are effectively addressing safety issues.\n\n?Investigating incidents so that similar accidents can be prevented.\n\n?Employee participation to help ensure that safety concerns of employees are addressed.\n\n?Using hot work permits to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fi"

The facility was designed to include several risk mitigation items which include: \n\n?combustible gas and fire detectors strategically placed throughout the facility;\n?alarms for temperature, pressure, and flow; \n?high-high and low-low interlocks that shut down equipment and isolate gas flow; \n?a dike around the storage tank; \n?fail-safe valves upon loss of power or air; and\n?emergency shut down valves.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nApollo Energy III?s Bowerman Landfill Gas Processing Facility is a brand new facility, and therefore, does not have any accidents to report.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nApollo Energy III has coordinated emergency response procedures with the Orange County Fire Authority and has also developed a written emergency action plan to help safely respond to a wide range of incidents including the accidental release of hazardous materials.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for:\n\n?Informing the Orange County Fire Authority and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in off-site consequences.\n?Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances.\n?Controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nApollo Energy III constantly strives to improve the safety of their process at the Bowerman Landfill Gas Processing Facility through both the incident investigation program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from everyone involved in operating the process."
