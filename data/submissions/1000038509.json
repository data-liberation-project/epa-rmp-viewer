However, if a release does occur, our personnel are trained to respond, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\n3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCHS SRU - ATS produces and distributes chemicals, which are used in agricultural and industrial applications.   CHS SRU - ATS converts hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into elemental sulfur for sale.   The unit also converts H2S and ammonia (NH3) into a fertilizer product, ammonium thiosulfate (ATS).\n\nCHS SRU - ATS was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.   Based on process knowledge, CHS SRU - ATS identified no listed flammable substances and one listed toxic regulated substance kept on site over threshold quantities (Anhydrous Ammonia).  \n\n\n\n4.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nCHS SRU - ATS has completed all hazard assessments required under the Risk Management Program rules.   Details of the Hazard Assessment are included in the data submitted to the U.S. EPA's Central Data Exchange.\n\n\n\n5.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the CHS SRU - ATS facility.  Because the processes at CHS SRU - ATS are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc.  8502)\n\nCHS SRU - ATS encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  CHS SRU - ATS has an employee representative in the position of Special Project Operator.  This employee is responsible for writing and updating operating procedures, verifying P&ID drawings with engineers and interfacing between unit operators and management.  CHS SRU -"

Other examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating in the Union/Management Health and Safety Committee, participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, and participating as a member of a PSM Task Force.  \n\nIn addition to participating in incident reporting and investigation, employees have access to all information created as part of the CHS SRU - ATS accident prevention program through an electronic computer system called Mockingbird.  This system allows employees to access numerous drawings, procedures, and safety information.\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc.  8503)\n\nCHS SRU - ATS keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration.  Specific departments within CHS Inc. are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  CHS SRU - ATS has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  CHS SRU - ATS assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nIn addition, CHS Inc. maintains numerous mechanical doc"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to assure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nMuch of this information is available through the Mockingbird system that can be accessed from computers in the CHS SRU - ATS facility, the maintenance shop and administrative offices.  Employees can obtain additional information not found on Mockingbird through their supervisor and the engineering department.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc.  8504)\n\nCHS SRU - ATS has a comprehensive program to help assure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and assure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nCHS Inc. primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Process Hazard Coordinator for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking he"

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help assure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, CHS Inc. periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures (CHS Inc.: Doc 8505)\n\nCHS SRU - ATS maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, CHS SRU - ATS maintains as part of the operating procedures, documentation of Safe Upper and Lower limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information includes consequences of deviation from those limits and steps to avoid or correct deviations from those limits.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc.  8506)\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, CHS SRU - ATS has implemented a c"

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to assure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc.  8507)\n\nCHS SRU - ATS uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, CHS SRU - ATS has procedures in place to assure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and, inform CHS SRU - ATS personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, CHS SRU - ATS evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  CHS SRU - ATS personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to assure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc.  8508)\n\nCHS SRU"

The purpose of the PSSR is to assure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc.  8509)\n\nCHS SRU - ATS has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: identification and categorization of process equipment, performing inspections and tests of process equipment, correcting identified deficiencies, applying quality assurance measures and documentation of these steps.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nInspections and tests are performed to help assure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels) and meets the applicable regulatory codes and standards.  If a deficiency is identified, corrections will be made before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to assure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nTraining requirements for maintaining and inspecting p"
