Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nAt the North Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (NRWWTP) located in Broward County, Florida, chlorine is stored for use for wastewater disinfection. Chlorine is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). It is management?s commitment to safety and adherence to Federal, State, and local rules and regulations that reduce the threat to our employees and nearby members of the community.  Our safety procedures involve the training of our employees in the safe handling of chlorine and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\n\n\nOur facility?s specific Emergency Response Plan includes notification of the local fire authority. In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. At the NRWWTP, the chlorine system exists in an enclosed building on our property. An emergency chlorine scrubber was put in place to help mitigate a potentially hazardous situation in the event of a chlorine leak within the building.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine. The primary purpose of the NRWWTP is to handle the wastewater coming in from the customers and treating to a certain level as specified by the EPA regulations. One of the treatment processes included in a wastewater treatment plant is disinfection by chlorine. \n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations including OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment. Our delivery drivers have been trained in regard to chlorine ha"

      "SummaryText": "zards and emergency response. Our employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing chlorine to our site.  In addition, we contract out to chlorine system professionals to periodically inspect our chlorine system, and make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to continue to ensure safe handling and use of chlorine. We maintain a computer generated preventative maintenance schedule of the chlorine process equipment.\n\n\n\n4. The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nIn lieu of a full-fledged ERP, this facility?s Emergency Action Plan is based upon the appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with our local emergency responders. We have discussed this program with the Pompano Beach Fire Department.\n\n\n\n5.Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) review of the chlorine system was conducted in July 2009.  From this review, the recommendations were:\n\n\n\n- Suplemental awareness training for plant staff.\n\n\n\n- Continued development and implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and scheduled maintenance activities.\n\n\n\n- Continued implementation of equipment manufacturers operation and maintenance procedures\n\n\n\n- Continued implementation of a mechanical integrity program, including visual inspections and replacement of equipment as necessary.\n\n\n\n- Continued implementation of the Process Safety Manual."
