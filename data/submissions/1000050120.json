Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to an incipient stage release or small fire to control and contain the release/fire. If larger than an incipent stage, the plant ESD will be activated and the plant will be evacuated.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant is located about 10 miles west of Farmington, New Mexico.  The facility includes compression, amine gas treating, liquids stabilization, acid gas injection, dehydration, and a cryogenic liquid recovery plant. The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, a mixed natural gas liquid stream (NGL) and an acid gas stream consisting of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. The acid gas stream is re-injected into an underground formation permitted for that purpose.  The liquid products contain ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier components.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The plant uses an amine process to remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide but does not contain threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic.  There are no significant toxic release scenarios to consider at the San Juan River plant.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequen"

The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process and employee safety issues.  These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change and safe work practices. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the San Juan River Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition"

      "SummaryText": "able to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe gas plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant uses the What if Checklist and HAZOPS methodologies of conducting process hazards analysis (PHA) to evaluate the equipment and processes at the plant.  These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the t"

      "SummaryText": ", all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\r\n\r\nContractors: \r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the San Juan River Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs):\r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is completed in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves"

The basic aspects of this program include: 1) conducting training, 2) developing written procedures, 3) performing inspections and tests, 4) correcting identified deficiencies, and 5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  All of these activities are tracked and documented using Avantis, an asset manager database.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on 1) an overview of the process, 2) safety and health hazards, 3) applicable maintenance procedures, 4) emergency response plans, and 5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to verify that equipment parameters are within acceptable limits.  For a vessel, the parameter being monitored would typically be wall thickness. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: \r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure iso"

These procedures along with training of affected personnel form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to 1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, 2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and 3) ensure that changes do not introduce an unknown hazard to the process.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nThe San Juan River Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.
