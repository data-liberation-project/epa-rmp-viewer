FACILITY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY.\n\n     THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF SOUTHERN FS, INC  ARE COMMITTED TO THE\n     PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTIAL \n     RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT.,\n     OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE\n     TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY,  WHICH IS LOCATED AT 510 WEST KASKASKIA STREET  \n     PINCKNEYVILLE, IL  IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR  SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS \n     AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION AS A CROP PRODUCTION \n     NUTRIENT.  THE STORAGE AND HANDLING SYSTEM CONSISTS OF 1 STORAGE TANK (30,000  GALLONS), LOADING\n     RISERS, ASSOCIATED PLUMBING AND NURSE TANKS.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED \n     FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE \n    300,000 POUNDS. THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE\n     TANKS.\n\n\n\n3.   THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n      THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL \n      APPLICABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THIS FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISION\n      OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA,\n      K-61.1\",  PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AS ADOPTED BY\n      STATE REGULATION AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH\n      ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS\n      A"
    },
    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 46207,
      "SummaryText": "MMONIA\".  COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND ON-GOING TRAINING OF OUR EMPLOYEES MAKE UP\n      OUR ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n4.   FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\n        THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF ACCIDENTAL RELEASES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE OCCURRED AT       \n        THIS FACILITY;\n        1. WE HAD AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF LESS THAN 1000#S OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ON APRIL 12, 2006. \n         THERE WERE NO EVACUATIONS BUT ADJACENT HOMES AND BUSSINESS WERE NOTIFIED FOR \n         PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES\n\n5.    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n       THE FACILITY HAS ...  A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA \n       STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38; \n \n        PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY\n        RIGHT- TO- KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III  (EPCRA);\n\n        IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY INVOLVING ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, IT IS OUR POLICY TO\n        NOTIFY THE PINCKNEYVILLE FIRE DEPT. AND THE PERRY COUNTY LEPC AND REQUEST THAT THEY RESPOND\n        TO THE EMERGENCY. OUR EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS HAVE BEEN COORDINATED WITH BOTH THE FIRE\n        DEPARTMENT AND LEPC.           \n\n6.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\n      SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ONGOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PERIODIC EVALUATIONS\n      ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE NO \n      SPECIFIC SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
