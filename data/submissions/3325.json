We have also been members of the Chlorine Institute for 15 years. \n\nThe HCI Safety Program of the HCI Health, Safety and Environmental Program is designed to prevent fires, explosions and accidental chemical releases. The program requires safety audits, inspection and maintenance programs, and safety training for employees and contract workers. Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations. \n\nWe are located at 607 Hudson Road in Chattanooga.   We employ 13 people.  The chlorine that is distributed from this plant is used by water treatment facilities and general industry to purify drinking water and sanitize swimming pools. We are active participants in the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n \nThe Emergency Programs in place at this facility include an:\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN \nFIRE PREVENTION PLAN\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nTRANSPORTATION EMERGENCIES PLAN\nSPILL PREVENTION CONTROL & COUNTERMEASURE PLAN\n \n The EPA was mandated by law to define the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) as an unlikely event: the largest single storage vessel losing all of its contents in 10 minutes. This facility does have off-site consequences to the public and the environment.\n \n The EPA calls a more likely incident, many of which will have limited or no off-site consequences, an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS). An ARS could be a hose or small vessel leak. For this facility, the ARS will have off-site consequences.\n \n HCI USA Distribution Co., Inc maintains Health, Safety and Environmental manuals, which contain company policies for Risk Management, Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach and Hazard Communication among others.  The manuals also include Emergency Action Plans, Emergency Response Plans, and Transportation Emergency Plans. The facility is also in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard which requires careful reviews of the hazards with and the safeguards that must be implemented to prevent releases of regulated chemicals.
