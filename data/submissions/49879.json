Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at facility.\n\nGaylord Chemical?s accidental release prevention program is based on the OSHA Process Safety Management system, and includes regularly scheduled process hazards analyses.  Its emergency response program includes a written response plan with specific actions to be taken by Gaylord Chemical personnel and information to be provided to responders in the event of an incident.  Gaylord Chemical also works with local emergency response agencies and members of the community to review and improve its emergency response program.\n\n   ?   Facility and regulated substances handled.\n\nAt its Bogalusa plant, Gaylord Chemical makes two products?DMS (dimethyl sulfide) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide)?and sells and ships them to customers in countries around the world.  Gaylord Chemical makes DMS by combining sulfur with organic wood by-products obtained from a near-by paper mill.  DMS is used for a variety of purposes, including as a safety odorant in natural gas.  Gaylord Chemical sells some of the DMS it manufactures and combines the remainder with oxygen and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), to make DMSO.   DMSO is used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.  N2O4 is a regulated substance under Louisiana regulations.  N2O4 exists only under pressure and when released a portion immediately becomes nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas, a common combustion product.  N2O4 is transported, stored, and used directly from one-ton steel cylinders.  While connected to the process, the cylinders are contained within a building equipped with an emergency scrubber to mitigate a release.\n\n\n   ?   "

The PSM program includes process hazards analyses, operating procedures, training, preventive maintenance, incident investigations, pre-startup reviews, and management of change.  Periodic audits assure compliance.\n\n   ?   Five year accident history.\n\nGaylord Chemical?s past five year accident history includes no accidents covered by these regulations.  \n\n   ?   Emergency response program.\n\nGaylord Chemical?s emergency response program is set forth in its written Emergency Plan and includes actions to be taken by Gaylord Chemical personnel in the event of many types of emergencies.  Gaylord Chemical coordinates emergency preparedness measures with local emergency response agencies including the Bogalusa Police Department, Bogalusa Fire Department, and the Washington Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (the designated LEPC).\nEmergency preparedness training for plant employees includes first aid, CPR, hazardous materials awareness and emergency notification procedures, and fire safety training.   Gaylord Chemical maintains a list of qualified emergency hazardous materials contractors available to assist in emergencies requiring specialized expertise. Finally, Gaylord Chemical has chemical monitoring instruments to warn of leaks and an emergency alarm system, which is tested weekly.\nIn addition to Gaylord Chemical?s internal Emergency Plan, Gaylord Chemical works with the City of Bogalusa and Washington Parish under its emergency preparedness plan that includes coordinated public safety and emergency response measures for Bogalusa and the surrounding area, including the following: a city-wide siren system; a traffic al"

Gaylord Chemical was a principal party in organizing and funding a local HazMat mutual aid emergency response organization ?ERMAS? available to the entire community. \n\n\n   ?   Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nGaylord Chemical has already made many improvements to its plant over the years.  These improvements, some of which make use of previously unavailable technology, have made the plant safer and have reduced the potential for accidental chemical releases.  Gaylord Chemical will continue to evaluate and improve plant safety and its emergency response abilities."
