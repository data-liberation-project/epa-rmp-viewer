Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is also supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine process areas as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element of this program. All the required process safety information was compiled as stated in the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. This information was used by CHMP staff to improve safety and reduce the likelihood and potential consequences of an accidental release. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine process.\r\nThe chlorine PHA was conducted by an experienced consultant with chlorine process operation and maintenance. The PHA was done using a combination of \"What-If\" and \"Checklist\" methods.  Based on the results of the PHA, recommendations for operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the plant were identified.  Over the years of RMP/PSM program implementation, changes have been adopted by the plant and have been incorporated into the plan.  \r\nOperating Procedures\r\nOperating procedures for the chlorine process have been developed as part of the RMP/PSM plan.

      "SummaryText": "SECTION 1\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nIntroduction \r\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment. They are transported on roads, water, and railways. The City of Minneapolis Columbia Heights Membrane Plant (CHMP) stores chemicals that are used in daily operations. The CHMP facility currently uses chlorine stored in up to twenty-four connected 1-ton containers. In addition to the twenty-four connected cylinders, space for up to twenty-four more reserve containers is available. Chlorine is used to disinfect treated water prior to distribution to customers in Minneapolis and surrounding communities. The natural world contains more than 1,500 chlorine-containing compounds. Chlorine is also used to disinfect wastewater, disinfect our swimming pools and protect human health through the destruction of disease-causing organisms. The World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children who die daily could be saved using an effective water disinfection agent such as chlorine.\r\nChlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable. However, it can support combustion under some circumstances.  Chlorine is a respiratory irritant, and exposure through inhalation or eye or skin contact can pose a health risk.  As a precaution, the CHMP has special safety systems that are an integral part of the chlorine systems.\r\nWe take our safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we take providing the community with treated water.  The following document describes the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, what could happen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on site, and what to do in the event of an emergency.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, codified under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.

This plan is referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\r\nChlorine is stored in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP is required.  This RMP document summarizes our existing safety systems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. \r\nThe CHMP has a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle accidental releases.  In addition, City staff regularly work with the Columbia Heights Fire Department and the Minneapolis Fire Department on emergency planning and response coordination, including conducting tours for and drills with these emergency responders of the facility. \r\nThe CHFP has been handling chemicals since 1911.  To date, no chlorine releases causing a safety or health hazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred.  Minor releases that have occurred at the plant have been safely remedied using existing emergency response procedures and techniques.  \r\nUnderstanding the Chemicals Used at the Columbia Heights Membrane Plant\r\nThe Columbia Heights facility, operating since 1911, is located at 4500 Reservoir Blvd. in Columbia Heights, Minnesota.  Raw water supplied from the Mississippi River is initially treated at the Fridley Softening Plant prior to delivery to the Columbia Heights.  The old filter plant plant provides coagulation and settling of the water.  The CHMP began operation in 2005 and provides the final membrane filtration treatment. Treated water is distributed to customers in Minneapolis and the surrounding communities.  The entire water treatment process includes screening, softening, coagulation, membrane filtration, and dis"

      "SummaryText": "infection.  The city treats an average of approximately 55 million gallons of water per day from all of their treatment plants.  The CHMP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine storage containers. \r\nChlorine is delivered to the plant in 1-ton containers by a chemical supplier.  Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn directly from the 1-ton containers through chlorinators and educator system and delivered to the disinfection process as chlorine solution. The CHMP uses state-of-the-art equipment to maximize the safety for plant staff and the community at large.  Some of the specific features are as follows.  Chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorine process areas.  Leak alarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant and the alarms sound at the central and local control panels. \r\nTo further improve safety an automatic cylinder valve closure system is provided for each on-line container that automatically closes if chlorine is detected in the room.  \r\nThe 1-ton container chlorine storage room is enclosed in a building.  The building is equipped with an emergency ventilation system that activates a scrubber when chlorine is detected in the room.  The scrubber neutralizes the chlorine gas and discharges treated air to the atmosphere.  The scrubber is sized to treat the entire contents of two 1-ton chlorine containers.  Plant staff utilize a supplied-air breathing system when making connections to the containers and a dried air system is used to purge process piping for maintenance.\r\nThe chlorine feed room is enclosed in a building and the process area is equipped with a ventilation system.  The process area includes an automatic ventilation system that operates when the chlorine leak detector detects chlorine in the room.  The Columbia Heights complex has a fence surrounding the site and is staffed 24 hours per day when in service.  Access control systems are in place for both the"

The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the potential effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public surrounding the facility. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serve as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore is referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nFor the Hazard Assessment, the distance a set endpoint concentration of chlorine gas would travel was determined. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case.\"  The results of the Hazard Assessment are reported to EPA.\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\r\nEmployee Participation \r\nThe participation of the plant staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\r\nPlant staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program through a series of meetings and workshops. Another way that the plant staff participated in the development of the RMP/PSM was the Process Hazard Analysis that is descr"

Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine process must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards and safe work practices. CHMP staff receives initial training on the operations and maintenance of the chlorine process.  In addition to RMP/PSM plan training, select staff has been trained to respond to an accidental release. Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years. Refresher training for emergency response (HAZWOPER) is conducted annually.\r\nContractors\r\nCHMP must make contractors aware of the known hazards of the chlorine process related to the contractors' work. In addition, the plant must make contractors aware of the applicable elements of its emergency response plan. CHMP must evaluate contractors' safety programs and select only those that can perform work on or adjacent to the chlorine process without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility or the surrounding public. \r\nBefore allowing a contractor to work on or adjacent to the chlorine process, the plant must obtain and evaluate information regarding the contractor's safety performance and programs. If a contractor is to work in or adjacent to any hazardous chemical, a safety briefing, to make the contractor aware of the plant's RMP/PSM plan requirements, must be conducted before work begins. \r\nPre-Startup Review\r\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new process that uses a regulated substance under RMP, or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine process that necessitate a change in the process safety information.

The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that the facility is ready to operate new and modified regulated processes safely. \r\nTo initiate the pre-startup safety review, all updated elements of the RMP/PSM plan are assembled for review. This includes all process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training and mechanical integrity. A pre-startup safety review team completes a pre-startup checklist. The pre-startup safety review team should complete and sign a Pre-startup Safety Review Form. This form documents the process, and helps ensure that the review has been properly performed. The Pre-startup Safety Review Form must be authorized before startup.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nAn effective mechanical integrity program is one of the primary lines of defense against an accidental release. The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\r\nThe CHMP maintenance staff schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. In addition to preventative maintenance, the plant staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. The staff that performs maintenance tasks is all trained as part of the RMP/PSM program.\r\nHot Works Permits\r\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the chlorine process. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, weldi"

Following the standards outline in this section aid in complying with the OSHA Hot Work Regulations (29 CFR 1910.252(a)).\r\nManagement of Change\r\nA system for the proper management of changes and modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions is required under the RMP/PSM. Modifications to the chlorine system will be reviewed before they are implemented to determine if the modification would compromise system safety. An effective change management system will help minimize the chance for an accidental release.\r\nIf a modification covered under RMP/PSM is made, its effects must be addressed, employees must be informed, and the written operating procedures must be updated. The intent is to require that all modifications to equipment, procedures, and processing conditions other than \"replacement in kind\" be managed by identifying and reviewing them before implementation. A Management of Change Committee that consists of plant engineering, operations, and/or maintenance staff is formed to evaluate any modifications that are covered under the RMP/PSM. The committee will complete a Management of Change Form that must be reviewed and authorized prior to initiation of a covered change.\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, facility management will establish an investigation team. As part of the investigation, the investigation team will prepare an incident report to recommend system"

The primary goals of conducting an internal compliance audit are to gather sufficient data to verify compliance with RMP/PSM requirements and good process safety practices, to identify process safety deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and to increase safety awareness among plant staff.\r\nThe compliance audit methodology is modeled after OSHA's guidelines for conducting regulatory PSM compliance audits: Compliance Guidelines and Enforcement Procedures, OSHA Instruction CPL 2-2.45A (September 28, 1995). An internal compliance audit must be conducted at the plant at least once every 3 years for the chlorine process. A team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the covered processes and an audit leader knowledgeable in RMP/PSM requirements and audit techniques will conduct the audits. Plant management and the audit team will promptly determine an appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit and document the corrective actions and the dates by which they must be taken.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Emergency Response Program develops a plan for dealing with a release. OSHA Process Safety Management regulation 29 CFR 1910.119(n) and EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR 68 Subpart E require that an Accidental Release Emergency Response Plan be prepared. The plan must be prepared in accordance with the provisions of another overlapping OSHA regulation-Employee Emergency Plans (29 CFR 1910.38(a)). In addition, provisions of the OSHA hazardous waste and emergency response standard, 29 CFR 1910.120 (q), must also be considered. The Emergency Planning and Response Plan described in this section complies with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, 29 CFR 1910.38(a), and 29 CFR 1910.120(q). \r\nThe Emergency Planning and Response plan provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine.

As part of the emergency response procedures there are plans for victim rescue, leak investigation, and communication with additional support agencies. The Emergency Planning and Response plan also indicates the level of training needed to carry out the emergency response procedures. \r\nInformation regarding self-contained breathing apparatus is provided in the Emergency Planning and Response plan. It also addresses plant site communication, emergency response equipment, first aid and medical treatment, medical surveillance and consultation, and emergency response drills. Plant personnel routinely communicate with emergency personnel in the surrounding jurisdictions.  The Minneapolis and Columbia Heights Fire Departments are aware of the chemicals stored and used on site.\r\nIn conclusion, the CHMP has taken all necessary steps to prevent the release of hazardous chemicals that may harm facility staff or the surrounding public."
