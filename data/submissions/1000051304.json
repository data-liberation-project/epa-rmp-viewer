Upon notification of an existing, or imminent emergency situation, the ERC will immediately identify the character, exact source, amount and extent (area) of the emergency.\r\nThe ERC will assess possible hazards both direct and indirect to human health, the environment and/or property both inside and outside of the plant. After this information is received, a decision is made whether or not to implement the provisions of the Emergency Action Plan.
