ACCIDENTAL RELEASE  PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE  POLICIES\n\nBayer Corporation is committed to the principles of Responsible Care which emphasize operating in a safe and environmentally correct manner. Management systems are in place to assure all facilities are complying with these principles.  There are Corporate Engineering Standards and Health, Environment and Safety Guidelines which address every aspect of Risk Management from design of intrinsically safe processes and use of layers of protection to incident tracking and program audits. Bayer Corporation is the North American subsidiary of Bayer, AG, which is headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany.  Bayer Corporation has its own corporate structure, policies and procedures which are consistent with those of the parent company, but are customized to meet US regulations and standards.  Bayer AG has established guidelines for Responsible Care in Environmental Protection and Safety, which includes a Directive for Process and Plant Safety that all Bayer facilities world-wide are expected to follow.  It provides guidance for safe process design and operation.\n\nIn the US, Bayer Corporation is an active member of the Chemical Manufacturer's Association Responsible Care Initiative.  Bayer has implemented all six codes of management practice which have been verified in practice by a third party audit.  Bayer Corporation has a Corporate Health, Environment and Safety Policy which states that it is the corporation's responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, customers and communities.  This is a primary responsibility, of equal importance to any other business objective.  This is supported in the corporation's Vision, Values and Beliefs, which emphasize applying technical expertise to advance our business while assuring the safety and protection of our employees, customers, communities and the environment.\n\nThe Bayer Corporation"

These include site Safety and Health Procedures, Emergency Response Procedures, Process Safety Management Procedures, Hazard Communication Procedure and Risk Management Procedure as well as safety plans in the individual production unit Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).\n\n2.  FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility manufactures plastics and resins.  The plastic pellet products are sold to molders for end use in refrigerator and automobile interiors, medical uses, computer housings, health spas, tools, and much more.  The resins are sold to primarily to paint manufacturers, where the resins add special qualities to automobile paints.  Other resins are used to coat circuit boards and coat aluminum cans to allow printing on the can.\n\nTwo RMP chemicals are used in the plastics process, acrylonitrile and butadiene.  These make up two of the three main chemicals used to make the plastic products.  (The third being styrene a non-RMP chemical).  Acrylonitrile is a liquid and is received by barge and stored in 2 large tanks (600,000 and 900,000 gallons) prior to being used in smaller tanks and in several plastic manufacturing processes.  Butadiene, a flammable chemical, received by rail car, and stored under pressure in a 60,000 gallon tank.  All storage tanks have concrete dike floors and walls capable of holding more than the quantity of the material being stored.  Multiple processes use these chemicals in various quantities ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 lbs in a process at one time.   Acrylonitrile represents the worst case scenario for toxic chemicals.  Butadiene is the only flammable RMP chemical and thus represents the worst case flammable scenario.\n\nOne RMP chemical is used in the Resins process, formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde is a toxic liquid received by tank truck in a water solution called formalin,"
