      "SummaryText": "The Silver Creek Processing Plant (Silver Creek Plant) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a ?regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)? in the processing of natural gas, where natural gas liquids (NGL) are extracted from the inlet gas using a cryogenic process and treated by an amine unit prior to being delivered to the pipeline for further market distribution. Therefore, this facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Silver Creek Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA?s PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA?s RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA?s 40 CFR 68 ? Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA?s PSM. \n\nThe Silver Creek Plant is a newly constructed facility; therefore, it has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\nAt the initial stages of operation, the Silver Creek Plant will employ twelve (12) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\nThe following information serves as the 2007 RMP submission for the Silver Creek Plant.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, reducing to the great"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility at any given time is 31,788 gallons (109,853 lbs). \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA?s PSM. The Silver Creek Plant?s Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility?s PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include: \n\n?Employee Participation\n?Process Safety Information\n?Process Hazard Analysis\n?Operating Procedures\n?Training\n?Contractors\n?Pre-startup Review\n?Mechanical Integrity\n?Hot Work Permits\n?Management of Change\n?Incident Investigation\n?Compliance Audits\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant is a newly constructed facility. For this reason, no accidental releases of NGL occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) year"

      "SummaryText": "s prior to August 2007.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. Furthermore, the facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Parker County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Parker County Sheriff?s Department. The Parker County Sheriff?s Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL release.  For these reasons, the Silver Creek Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Silver Creek Plant?s PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety. The Silver Creek Plant has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary."
