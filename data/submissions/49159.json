Therefore, this facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Silver Creek Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA\u00bfs RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA\u00bfs 40 CFR 68 \u00bf Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA\u00bfs PSM. \n\nThe Silver Creek Plant is a newly constructed facility; therefore, it has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\nAt the initial stages of operation, the Silver Creek Plant will employ twelve (12) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\nThe following information serves as the 2007 RMP submission for the Silver Creek Plant.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL extraction operations, reducing to the great"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility at any given time is 31,788 gallons (109,853 lbs). \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Silver Creek Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA\u00bfs PSM. The Silver Creek Plant\u00bfs Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility\u00bfs PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.

Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. Furthermore, the facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Parker County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Parker County Sheriff\u00bfs Department. The Parker County Sheriff\u00bfs Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL release.  For these reasons, the Silver Creek Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Silver Creek Plant\u00bfs PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nMaintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and incident investigations will identify changes to improve safety. The Silver Creek Plant has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary."
