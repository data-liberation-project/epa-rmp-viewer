      "SummaryText": "The East Chicago Water Filtration Plant is located in East Chicago, Indiana.  Its covered process is the chlorination of municipal drinking water.  This is done using one ton tanks of chlorine gas, liquefied under pressure.  The worst case scenario effects seven thousand people, and the alternate effects thirty-two thousand people.  The facility is near a marina, a gambling boat, and residencies.  All scenarios were completed using RMP Comp.    The chlorine process is located indoors in it's own room.  There is a chlorine lead detector located along the process which alerts the operator, an operator is on duty at all times, to shut down the system to minimize releases.\n\nEast Chicago Water Filtration Plant is covered by OSHA PSM.  This program was designed and implemented at the time of writing the RMP.  The facility has all applicable OSHA documents on site; such as confined space entry, PPE, Lockout/tagout, and fire prevention procedures, in writing.  The chlorine process is inspected daily and is only dealt with by trained employees.  There is personal protective equipment on site for which the employees are trained to use.  All employees are also trained in evacuation procedures that begin with the sound of the chlorine alarm.  All accidental releases are handled by the East Chicago Fire Department.  They are the responders and handle all evacuations of the surrounding neighborhoods.  The facility has an emergency action plan on file at the fire department."
