It is the policy of this facility to provide and maintain safe working conditions and to operate and manage facilities in a manner that protects the environment and meets or surpasses all applicable Federal, State, and local environmental regulations.  Plant Crist has a safety program designed to ensure that employees and contractors are working in a safe environment.  The program includes training, operating and maintenance procedures, as well as auditing and incident investigation programs. \n\nPlant Crist will have one process covered by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, as a Program 3 process.  Anhydrous ammonia will be stored on site in two identical 20,500 gallon vessels for use as part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction system (SCR) on Unit 7 to control nitrogen oxide emissions from burning low sulfur coal.  \n\nThe worst case ammonia release scenario was defined as the release of the largest single vessel occurring over a 10 minute time period. The Degdis model predicted that the ammonia would travel 2.8 miles before reaching its endpoint.  The 2000 Census data predicted that 14,423 would be affected by a worse case ammonia release.  The alternative release scenario used for the modeling was as follows: a valve fault causing three pressure relief valves to open fully and release ammonia at a rate of 3.7 kg/s for approximately one minute followed by a release resulting from improper shutting, causing the leak to continue at  0.037kg/s for 59 minutes.  The model predicted that the ammonia would travel 0.12 miles before it reached its endpoint.  The alternative release scenario would affect no off-site pe"
