Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Butte County Rice Growers Association, Richvale facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1121 Richvale Highway, Richvale, California, 95974 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.
