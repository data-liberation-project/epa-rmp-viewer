The facility is regulated under RMP due to onsite ammonia storage in excess of the RMP applicability threshold of 10,000 pounds.  Ammonia is used at the facility in the ammonia refrigeration system.  The receipt, storage, and conveyance of ammonia is the single highly hazardous process present at the North Charleston facility.  \n\nThe facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by:  \n\n1) the existing Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119 already in place at the facility, and \n2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for ammonia in response to the RMP requirements.  \n\nThe management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (i.e. International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance for ammonia).\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted for the facility's single largest vessel based on US EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998) and RMP*Comp Software.  The worst-case release scenario is a 10-minute gaseous ground release of the contents of the single largest vessel at 100% capacity.  The storage volume of this vessel is restricted to 80 percent of its total capacity by administrative controls.  The alternative release scenario assumes a < inch diameter gasket rupture.  Public receptors were determined to be located within the impact zone of both the worst-case and alternative releases.  No environmental receptors were located within the impact zone of either scenario.   \n\nFiv"

These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequence of any accidental ammonia release from the facility and include such measures as process hazards analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup safety, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.  The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has coordinated response with the North Charleston HAZMAT Response Team to ensure that they will respond to any accidental release from the ammonia system that is too large for Coburg to handle alone.  Coburg officials will respond to all other ammonia releases based on the Emergency Planning and Response Section of the Process Safety/Risk Management Program Manual.  \n\nSafety Management and Changes\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered ammonia system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes.  To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required by RMP.
