This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and having preventative maintenance programs in place. Pratt has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) Plan, SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed plans have a minimum of annual training requirements in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. Annual training is also a good time to discuss any situations at the facility the occurred over the previous year that the helped the plant gain knowledge on how to better address chemicals or spill practices. New employees are required to undergo training on the plans listed above prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. If job duties warrant, new employees may also be required to read through the plans, as well. Pratt's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will follow the applicable procedures outlined in the SPCC/FRP, Industrial SWPPP, and H&S Plans to respond to, contain, clean-up, and properly dispose of the release.\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nPratt is located in Pratt, Pratt County, Kansas. The facility operates for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn. The regulated substance stored at the facility is a flammable mixture (natural gasoline), typically referred to as denaturant. \nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\nWorst Case Scenario:\nFlammable Mi"

      "SummaryText": "xture (Denaturant) - The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, otherwise referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature 200 proof ethanol prior to shipment off-site. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground internal floating roof steel tank within the tank farm. The tank farm is located within a lined berm with gravel\noverlay for means of secondary containment. A worst-case natural gasoline SDS was used to determine RMP applicability and for RMP Comp modeling. The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation for the flammable mixture. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results are included in the RMP documentation file. Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Earth as well as facility's knowledge of the surrounding area. \nAlternate Case Scenario:\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant) - The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to estimate the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi. Model results are included under Pratt's RMP documentation file. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing off-loading if possible. Therefore, a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment system with underground piping that leads to the tank farm berm. For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. Population data was obtained using CAPS and public receptor information was obtained using Google Eart"

No environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate case release of denaturant.\nThe Pratt facility qualifies as a Program 3 due the close proximity of public receptors; therefore, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been implemented at the plant.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs in place at the Pratt facility are described in earlier portions of this Executive Summary and in the Industrial SWPPP and SPCC/FRP plans onsite. As part of training, employees participate in drills and exercises in order to test responsiveness to releases of chemicals onsite. These drills and exercises are evaluated by Pratt\nmanagement to determine if any additional training or education is required.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nPratt has not had an accident related to or involving the covered process in the past five years.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nPratt has onsite safety procedures outlined in the facility Health and Safety Plan. All applicable OSHA standards are followed and safety training is provided to all employees on an annual basis. Safety training also includes testing to ensure that employees are completing the training modules and to test their retention of the training content. Emergency response is also addressed in the facility's Industrial SWPPP and SPCC/FRP plans (and annual training). All Plans listed in this Executive Summary have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nPratt will continue to provide annual training programs to employees covering both safety and environmental programs in place at the facility to ensure the continued safety of employees and contractors. If any additional training is deemed necessary, Pratt will ensure that additional training or education opportunities are presented to the employees in need. There are no planned"
