As part of this commitment, Firestone has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes of the Lake Charles Plant.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Program (the RMP rule) and OSHA's 29 CFR part 1910.119 (the PSM rule).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide interested parties with a description of the risk management program at the Plant.  \n\nFirestone is an active participant in the community.  The Lake Charles Plant is voluntarily involved in the Calcasieu Community Advisory Panel (CAP).  The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The Lake Charles Plant is also an active member of the Lake Area Industry/McNeese Engineering Partnership (LAI/MEP), the Safety Council of Southwest Louisiana, Mutual Aid of Southwest Louisiana, Calcasieu Area Emergency Response (CAER), and the Calcasieu Parish Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nOver the past five years the Lake Charles Plant has received several corporate pollution prevention awards and several National Safety Council and Bridgestone/Firestone corporate awards for both one million and two million manhours worked without a lost time accident.\n\nFirestone is committed to the safety of workers, the public and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

The Plant produces a wide range of synthetic rubber products manufactured by the solution polymerization process.\n\nTwo flammable substances and one toxic substance are covered under the Accidental Release Program (ARP).  The two flammable substances are 1, 3-butadiene and 2-butene-cis.  The toxic substance is boron trifluoride.\n\n10.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSES (HAZARD ASSESSMENT) SUMMARY\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario for flammables on site involves an instantaneous release/evaporation/dispersion and explosion of the contents of a 1, 3-butadiene storage vessel.  No credit is taken for any of the existing mitigation systems.  This is a physically impossible event which is not expected to ever occur.  Analysis of this hypothetical event indicates the endpoint would extend beyond the boundaries of the Plant.  \n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario for a toxic release on site involves a rupture of a boron trifluoride storage container.  No credit is taken for any of the existing mitigation systems.  In accordance with federal and state guidelines for calculation, this release is assumed to occur at the worst case weather \n\nconditions of \"F\" Pasquill stability class and 1.5 meters/second, which occurs only on still, cloudy nights.  Although we believe this event is unlikely to occur, analysis of this event indicates the endpoint would extend beyond the boundaries of the plant.\n\nThe Planning Case (Alternate Release) Scenario for a flammable involves a release of 1, 3-butadiene from piping in the Tank Farm Area.  A 3/4-inch piping failure was assumed to have occurred and it was assumed that no one would be able to shut off the flow for 10 minutes.  This is a very conservative assumption as there are automatic shut-off valves in this piping, as well as detection capa"

Although we believe this event is unlikely to occur, analysis of this event indicates the endpoint would extend beyond the boundaries of the plant.\n\nThe Planning Case (Alternate Release) Scenario for the only toxic material involves a release of boron trifluoride from a 1/2-inch piping failure at the discharge of a storage container.  It was assumed that no one would be able to shut off the flow for 30 seconds.  This is a realistic assumption as there is a Plant safety policy to have operations and plant protection personnel standing by wearing personal protection equipment any time this material is being served to the process.  There is also detection, alarm, and water deluge capability at this specific process location.  This case was analyzed at average weather conditions for our area.  Although we believe this event is unlikely to occur, analysis of this event indicates the endpoint would extend beyond the boundaries of the plant.\n\n11.0    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR PROCESS SAFETY/RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Lake Charles Plant. The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The Prevention Program questions found in section 7 of the Risk Management Plan Data Elements submittal have been answered assuming that, for this initial RMP submittal only, they apply to OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n11.1    Employee Participation\n\nOpen communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\n11.2    Process Safety Information\n\nThe Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). Other chemical-specific information includes maximum intended inventories of chemicals, information on inadvertent chemical mixtures that could occur and their associated hazards. The Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment, which include information on materials of construction, piping/instrumentation diagrams, relief systems design, as well as others.  This information is provided to maintain safe operations at the facility.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Plant uses some or all of the hazard evaluation techniques outlined in the American Institute of Chemical Engineers publication Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures to perform these evaluations.   The analyses are conducted using a team with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include employees with expertise in the following areas: technical, staff engineering, operations, maintenance, safety, and PHA methodology.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  All PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team updates and revalidates each PHA every five years.  These periodic reviews are conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\n\n11.4    Operating Procedures\n\nThe Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal startup, (3) normal \n\noperation, (4) normal shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) emergency shutdown, (7) temporary operation, (8) preparation for maintenance procedure, (9) quality assurance, and, (10) inadvertent mixing.  \n\nThe specific instructions include the applicable safety precau"

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\n11.5    Training\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. \n\nNew employees receive immediate training in the following areas of the process: overview of process; process fundamentals; and process description.  Training includes emphasis on specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the job.  This training must be passed through oral or written testing and the employee must demonstrate and verify that they understand the required operating procedures before they are allowed to operate the unit alone.  \n\nIn addition, all operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  This refresher training on the operating procedures is to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  Additionally, more frequent training will occur upon the request of the employee.  The appropriate frequency of training is decided by management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.
