Audits are conducted at least every 3 years (PSM Tri-Annual audits).  The audit  findings are resolved by area production teams and Refinery Management.  Corrective actions are tracked until completion; final resolution of each finding is documented and the two most recent audit reports retained.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPrevention program activities address equipment failures, human errors and PSRM system deficiencies.\nIn addition to these activities, the Refinery has safety features on many units to (1) contain and control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The specific safety features used are detailed in Section 7 in the RMP Data Elements.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\nThe Refinery maintains a written emergency response program to protect workers, the public and the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a regulated substance release.  It addresses all aspects of emergency response, including first-aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public and post incident cleanup and decontamination.  In addition, the Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address their use.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is reviewed annually and updated based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  \nThe emergency response program is coordinated with the Los Angeles City Fire Department (L.A.F.D).

At the time of this submittal the required engineering and equipment plans are complete and construction is underway to incorporate this modified process.\nThe Refinery is committed to accident prevention and loss control through personnel training programs, considering safety in design, installation, operation and maintenance of processes and implementation of controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release in coordination with the City of Los Angeles Fire Department."

The submission of this update is done for the sole purpose of addressing administrative changes at the facility that have occurred since the 5-year RMP update submission.\n\nSince the last RMP submission on June 21, 2004, Valero Wilmington Refinery upgraded its HF Alkylation unit with the ReVAP (Reduce Volatile Alkylation Process) technology, an alkylation system that uses modified hydrogen fluoride, and installed a new process Unit 67, Alkylation Feed Dryer Unit.  The Alkylation Feed Dryer removes water from the olefin feed to the Unit 68 HF Alkylation Unit.  \n\nThe upgrade and new installation made in the facility have triggered a revised PHA and hazard review, and subsequently require a revised offsite consequence analysis.  Therefore, in accordance with the requirements stipulated in 40 CFR Part 68, Section 190(b)(5 and 6) [(\u00a768.190(b)(5) and (\u00a768.190(b)(6)), the facility is required to update its RMP within six months of the change.\n\nThis RMP was prepared according to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA RMP Rule, Accidental Prevention Requirements, Risk Management Programs under the Clear Air Act, Section 112\u00ae (7), June 20, 1996,  [CAA 112\u00ae (7)].

It must submit a single RMP for the entire refinery; because it handles several listed regulated substances that exceed RMP listed threshold quantities (TQ).\n\nIn complying with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP Program Level 3 requirements, the Refinery developed a Process Safety Risk Management System to address Accident Prevention and Emergency Response.  Refinery managers and supervisors in process engineering, project design engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety have primary responsibility for implementation and maintaining element compliance.  Mr. Michael Butler has the designated authority for integration and continuous audit of all RMP elements.\n \nFor the past 5-years, the Refinery has had no reportable accidents involve a part 68 regulated substances with offsite impacts.  Several minor accidental releases of hydrocarbons and toxic materials did occur.  However, neither injuries nor significant property damage occurred (on-site and off-site) due to the effectiveness of the Company's emergency response team. \nThe refinery handles regulated flammable materials in several processes.  The EPA regulated toxic materials handled are anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen sulfide, which are stored in quantities that exceed TQs.\n  \nThe Refinery maintains a Process Safety and Risk Management System (PSRM), which was developed during the implementation of OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).

As standard business practice employees participate in; PHA\u00bfs, procedure development, audits, routine Area Production Team meetings and the Health & Safety Committee process to monitor, evaluate and improve process safety.  \nFurther enhancing these systems, Valero employees have developed a Behavior Based Safety program which encourages job site observations and feedback to fellow employees regarding their safe work practices.  Finally, in May 2003, Valero Wilmington became an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR site.  As of this writing Valero Wilmington Refinery fully expects the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR site recertification status to be expected in April 2008.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure safe operation of each process.
