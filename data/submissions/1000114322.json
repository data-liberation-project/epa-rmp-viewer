      "SummaryText": "George S. Coyne Chemical Co., Inc. is a chemical distributor serving the areas of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New York, Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia.  In this capacity, Coyne is a re-seller of chemicals to industrial, commercial and municipal customers.  Of the current inventory consisting of approximately 200 types of chemicals, three are considered extraordinarily hazardous under the RMP regulations and are stored above the applicable threshold value.  The facility is located on 8.393 acres within the Edgely Industrial Park and is bordered by a rail siding to the North, a water retention basin on the East, State Road to the South and Westrock to the West.\n\nThe three chemicals on site subject to RMP regulations are:\n\nChlorine (CAS # 7782-50-5)\nSulfur Dioxide (CAS # 7746-09-5)\nOleum - 20% (CAS # 8014-95-7)\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are also subject to the OSHA PSM regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\nStationary Source Identification\n\nCoyne Chemical has identified the storage of the reference materials and packaging of the oleum as the stationary sources at the facility.  \n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are both contained within pre-packaged cylinders of either 100 lbs. or 150 lbs. of product.  All full cylinders are stored inside storage rooms dedicated to each product within the warehouse in storage racks with up to 16 cylinders per rack. \n\nOleum is transferred from tank trucks, to 55-gal steel drums and stored onsite prior to shipments to customers. Oleum is stored in a designated portion of the warehouse with limited traffic. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility is a full 150-pound cylinder release of sulfur dioxide occurring outside of the facility during the box truck unloading process. This scenario does not consider any of the passive mitigating systems built into the storage process. The sulfur dioxide and chlorine cylinders are transported and stored in storage racks designed to house this type of cylinder. When shipped individually"

      "SummaryText": ", cylinders are secured to the transportation vehicle. In addition, the loading and unloading step is the shortest step of the process, making the worst-case scenario unlikely to occur.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nCoyne has arrangements with outside emergency response personnel to mitigate an emergency. The facility has a working relationship with the local fire department and fire chief in addition to coordinating the emergency response plan with the Bucks County Emergency Management Agency. In the event of a discharge while the facility is closed, Coyne ensures that a manager can be reached via the emergency voice mail in order to organize an emergency response. In addition, the fire alarms and gas monitors are connected to central station monitoring that will inform the proper entities that there is an emergency at any time of the day. \n\nIt is the policy of the George S. Coyne Chemical Co., Inc. to have programs in place to identify and handle emergency response and public preparedness issues involving products handled at facilities operated by the company, in transit, and during storage and/or use at a customer\u0092s site. These programs address the following items deemed critical to achieving this goal:\n\nA.\tDocumentation, review, coordination and tests of emergency response plans.\nB.\tProcedures for response, reporting, investigation and implementation of preventative measures with respect to incidents which could have or did result in a release, explosion and/or fire.\nC.\tProcedures for supplying emergency response information regarding chemicals handled to emergency response agencies and communication with state and local emergency planning and response organizations regarding potential hazards of products handled at facilities.\n\nSecurity\n\nAn (8) eight-foot tall chain link fence equipped with barbed wire around the top protects the outside boundary of Coyne Chemical.  The Southeast gate serves as the main entrance for all traffic.  This gate is electrically controlled, re"

The gate on the West side is kept locked at all times but can be unlocked and opened if evacuation through that gate is necessary.\n\nOverhead light standards are located on the exterior perimeter of the plant property as well as positioned along the top of the building to illuminate all exterior areas of the property. All entries to the office and warehouse are secured and monitored by an alarm system.  Movement through the facility is further managed utilizing a key pass system.  In the event of an unauthorized entrance, an alarm is sounded at a central monitoring station, the local police department is dispatched, and a Coyne Chemical manager is notified.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Procedures\n\nMitigation for Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide scenarios includes applying a cylinder \"A\" Kit or placing the leaking cylinder into a containment vessel located on-site.  Leaking drums of oleum can be contained in secondary containment.  \n\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in chemical specific rooms within the warehouse.  These rooms have product-specific detectors with visual and audible alarms that will trigger in the event of a leak from a cylinder. These alarms trigger a number of passive systems to minimize a release.
