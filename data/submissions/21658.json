The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nUS Foodservice maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nUS Foodservice has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of US Foodservice to evacuate and to allow the fire department and the refrigeration contractors to respond to the emergency.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at US Foodservice was completed in 1998.  The facility is located at 1685 W. Cheyenne Avenue in North Las Vegas, Nevada 89030.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe US Foodservice facility receives and distributes food and food products to local vendors.

Cheyenne Avenue in North Las Vegas, Nevada 89030.  A majority of the recommendations from the PHA were determined to be complete during the PHA Revalidation on March 29, 1999.  The remaining recommendations are scheduled to be complete by June 1, 1999.\n\nHAZOP Study\n\nR01    Investigate and document the number of sensors in the engine room.  Also document system actions upon reaching concentrations of the low and the high ammonia sensor setpoints.\n\nR02    Establish a procedure to replace/recertify relief valves every time one unseats or every five years, whichever is sooner.\n\nR03    Establish and document system maintenance procedures that include following the manufacturer's recommendations on all applicable equipment.\n\nR04    Install safety shower/eye wash stations that can be easily reached from normal maintenance locations including the roof of the engine room (for condensers).\n\nR05    Include checking pressure regulator valves on daily log sheet.\n\nR06    Establish a procedure to clean up (with an absorbent material) and properly dispose of spilled liquid ammonia.\n\nR07    Inform the fire department or other potential emergency responders of the danger of spraying water on a pool of ammonia.\n\nR08    Ensure that the High Stage Accumulator is equipped with a high level alarm, and a high level switch that shuts down compressors.\n\nR09    Establish and document a procedure to annually test the high level alarm and the high level switch on the High Stage Accumulator.\n\nR10    Ensure that booster compressors shut down as a result of the high stage compressors shutting down (not vice versa).\n\nR11    Establish and document a regular procedure for draining oil from the system.\n\nR12    Establish a procedure to test the pH of the water in the dilution tank periodically as an indi"

The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (Controlled Pressure Receiver) - 21,600 pounds in 10 minutes.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.    This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n     Scenario Description: A release of ammonia from resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 134 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.    This release reaches off site and may impact population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe US Foodservice ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the US Foodservice facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nThe US Foodservice facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance"
