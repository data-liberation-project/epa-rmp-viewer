      "SummaryText": "A.  Who is ChemArt?\n\nChemArt manufacturers etched decorative metal parts.  The manufacturing process involves automated etching equipment utilizing closed loop systems and is located at 11 New England Way in Lincoln, RI.  ChemArt employs about 85 employees from the surrounding areas.  \n\n\n\n\n\nB.  What is the Risk Management Plan?\n\nIn 1996, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated regulations for the response, prevention, and detection of accidental released of 77 toxic substances and 63 flammable substances.  The regulation, called \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions,\" is found at 40 CFR 68 and meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990's Section 112r.  The purpose of these Risk Management Programs is to prevent accidental releases where possible, minimize the impacts of accidental releases on the general population and the environment, and to educate the public on the potential impacts of an accidental release.  \n\n\n\nA facility is subject to these regulations if it handles, stores, uses, or manufactures more than a thresholds quantity of a regulated substance in a \"process.\"  An applicable facility must prepare a Risk Manangement Plan that includes a hazard assessment, accident prevention prgram, and emergency response program, and submit the Risk Management Plan to EPA by June 21, 1999.  The facility is also required to submit updates of the Risk Management Plan every five years.  \n\n\n\nC.  How is ChemArt Subject to RMP?\n\nThe primary hazard in this process is the release of chlorine.  There have been no releases of chlorine from this process that could be classified as catastrophic since the original installation.  The specific hazards of the process are described in the following paragraphs in terms of the chlorine flow from one ton container delivery to the regenerators on the etching tanks.  \n\n\n\nFour one-ton containers of liquid chlorine are stored in a cutoff storage room that shares two walls with the rest of the building.

      "SummaryText": " The containers are manifolded in pairs with one in each pair supplying chlorine to the system while the other container is held in reserve.  The containers are set on cradles that are part of the weighing system.  There is a potential for chlorine release during the change-out of empty containers when pipes are disconnected, containers are hoisted from their cradles, full containers are transferred from the delivery truck with an overhead crane, and pipes are reconnected.  A ChemArt employee use the standard operating procedures to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release during container change-out.\n\n\n\nThe one ton chlorine containers are posisitioned so that chlorine is withdrawn only from the gaseous phase.  The gas pressure in the ccontainers and in the withdrawal lines is the vapor pressure of chlorine at the temperature of the liquid in the container.  At 70 degrees F, the vapor pressure is approimately 85 psig.  The Chlorine Storage Room is not climate controlled, so that in the warm weather seasons with temperatures as high as 90 degrees F, the pressure could rise to about 125 psig.  In colder weather, the pressure would be less than 50 psig.  The containers have fusible plugs which release at 159-165 degrees F to prevent tank rupture during a fire.  There are no sources of ignition or flammable materials in the Chlorine Storage Room; however, a fire in the rest of the building that engaged the room could cause the fusible plugs to release large quantities of liquid and gaseous chlorine.  The evaporation of chlorine in the containers reduces the temperature of the liquid and the vapor presure.  Immediately next to each set of chlorine containers is a Capital Controls pressure regulator that reduces the pressure to below atmospheric for transmission through two chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) and PVC delivery liness through the Wastewater Treatment Room and into the Etching Room.  The regenerators operate in such a way as to maintain the pressure in "

      "SummaryText": "the delivery lines below atmospheric.  The regulators in the Chlorine Storage Room are set below atmospheric and will not deliver gas to the transmission lines if the pressure in the delivery lines exceeds the subatmospheric set point.\n\n\n\nA chlorine sensor is positioned near the floor in the Chlorine Storage room and near the floor in the etching room.  An alarm will sound in the ethching room or  outside the Chlorine Storage Room if the chlorine concentration reaches 1.0 ppm in the area. If this occurs ChemArt has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The Emergency Response Program consists of the Emergency Coordinator being notified (Trained ChemArt employee) and the building being evacuated.  The Emergency Coordinator is responsible for notifying the Lime Rock Fire Department, Woonsocket Fire Department, Narragansett Bay Commission, and Landmark Medical Center as well as providing technical assistance to the fire department Hazmat Responder.  In the event of an emergency that may potentially impact the community, the Lincoln Police Department will notify residents and businesses.   \n\n\n\nAn etching solution regenerator is attached to each etching tank.  The etching solution is circulated through educators and back to the etching tanks.  The venturi effect of flow of liquid through the educator causes a partial vacuum to form which draws chlorine from the delivery lines.  Chlorine is automatically metered to the educators through valves actuated by a controller that reponds to the oxidation-reduction potential in the etching solution.  The action of the educators serves to keep the chlorine delivery lines under negative pressure all the way back to the pressure regulator in the Chlorine Storage Room.  \n\n\n\nFailure of engineering and administrative controls could result in the release of chlorine into the Chlorine Storage Room, the Wastewater Treatment Room, the Etching Room, and other parts of the plant.

In this program  a HAZOP PHA analysis was used to identify possible failures at various points in the process, the consequences of those failures and the controls and procedures that are in place to prevent failures.  \n\n\n\nWhenever changes are made in the process such as increases in the use of chlorine or changes in control equipment and procedures, additional training will be provided at the time the changes are made in accordance with the management of change procedure."
