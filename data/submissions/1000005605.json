      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAs required in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act Risk Management Program rules listed in 40 CFR Part 68, this document contains information intended to analyze the impacts of an accidental release of an extremely hazardous substance and to highlight the steps the facility is taking to prevent a release from occurring. The intent of the rule is to reduce the likelihood of a chemical release and the consequences of a release if one were to occur. The process utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are both regulated substances under the Risk Management Program. Mount Clemens WWTP has a maximum inventory of 12,000 pounds of chlorine and 12,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, which both surpass the EPA threshold of 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively. The facility is also subject to the Occupational Health and Safety Association (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Modeling results indicate the worst-case release would cause an offsite impact. Due to these factors, Mount Clemens WWTP is subject to Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.\nBecause of the potential hazards when using chlorine and sulfur dioxide, it is essential that steps be taken to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release. The prevention program for Mount Clemens WWTP includes the requirements for a Program 3 process that the facility currently meets under OHSAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Specifically, Process Safety Information, Operating Procedures, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Contractors and Management of Change contribute to safe operation of the facilities chlorination and dechlorination processes.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted by the facility helps to identify potential problems before they occur.  This process allows for participation of employees and identification of opportunities for improvement at the plant.  The most recent PHA conducted by the plant ident"

      "SummaryText": "ified no major deficiencies in either system.  The PHA did not identify an impending release of either chemical based on the operation or maintenance of the systems.\n\nAs described in the Training section of the PSM document, each employee with job responsibilities associated with the storage, handling or use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide is thoroughly trained or otherwise deemed competent in the work procedures relevant to their responsibilities.  Employee participation is also a key component of the successful implementation of the PSM Plant at the Mount Clemens WWTP.\n\nThe hazard analysis performed for the facility also includes a review of its five year accident history. During the past five years, Mount Clemens WWTP has not had an accidental release that met the criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a).  \n\nMount Clemens WWTP has been actively involved in emergency response planning. They have worked closely with the Macomb County Local Emergency Management Agency to develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for offsite response. Mount Clemens WWTP is a Program 3 source and a non-responding facility. The Mount Clemens WWTP Emergency Response Plan outlines procedures for internal response to incidental releases and notification and coordination with the local emergency response organizations in the event of an incidental release which cannot be contained and will have offsite impacts. \n\n"
