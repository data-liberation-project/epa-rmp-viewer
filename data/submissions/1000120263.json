Of these chemicals, Westlake has estimated the required worst case releases using chlorine and propane as well as several alternative releases using chloroform, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and ethylene.\n\nThe Westlake CA&O/Monomers Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for the facility and utilizes a staff of safety and environmental professionals to maintain compliance with all aspects of the plant's Risk Management Plan.  In addition, all plant personnel are trained to be responsible for carrying out their respective duties in a safe manner using established approved procedures.\n\nThe Westlake CA&O/Monomers Plant at Calvert City manufactures vinyl chloride for use in the plastics industry.  The sites feedstock, ethane, is used in the plant's production of ethylene. The site also produces chlorine which is reacted with ethylene to ultimately produce vinyl chloride.  A series of unit operations which include reactions, stripping operations, and various finishing steps is used prior to product storage for subsequent shipment to various customers via rail, truck, barge and pipeline.\n\nThe Westlake CA&O/Monomers Corporation is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  As a site that is under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, the Calvert City Plant is committed to preventing chemical emergencies.  Prevention of chemical emergencies starts with specifying that all equipment, piping, vessels, tanks, and systems meet all applicable design codes and specifications.  Documentation of these codes and specifications form the basis of Westlake's process information"

Supplementing this information are trained employees working with operating instructions, startup/shutdown instructions and awareness of consequences of deviations in standardized procedures.  These programs are designed to keep the processes operating within safe limits that minimize potential adverse impact to employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.\n\nUnder PSM, skilled employees are involved in all aspects of Plant operations, including the Safety and Environmental programs.  Employees are routinely trained and challenged to ensure the safety of the Plant.  Westlake's safety program consists of many elements, such as use of a Management of Change system for plant operating procedures, hot work and lock-out/tag-out procedures, and regular process hazards analyses using standard industrial practices of hazard and operability study (HAZOP) methodologies.  All contractors at the facility are subject to the same rules and procedures as Westlake employees.\n\nA comprehensive Mechanical Integrity Program includes routine inspection and testing of process equipment, tanks, vessels, and piping.  Periodic reviews and auditing of the proper implementation of such programs involves personnel from the production units, the Health, Safety, and Environmental group (HSE), and Plant and Corporate management.\n\nKey to the Plant's prevention programs are the levels of protection intentionally designed into the process.  At the most basic levels, trained operators working with current operating procedures and process safety information keep the processes operating safely and in compliance with applicable health, safety and environmental regulations.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to maintain the processes within these limits and provide the information and equipment to keep the process controlled at"

      "SummaryText": "established operating ranges.  Instrumentation alarms, process safety trips, and interlocks alert the plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process changes.  In the event an out-of-range condition, process safety devices, such as pressure relief valves, rupture discs, automatic shutdown, and critical interlocks would become active. Major process areas may also activate use of fire sprinklers, halon systems in the computer rooms, sensors, monitor nozzles and dry or CO2 chemical extinguishers to further mitigate immediate incidents as necessary.\n\nAnother level of protection to the safety systems includes trained emergency responders. The plant has emergency fire equipment, including a fire truck and an emergency response vehicle.  Each shift is led by a Unit Supervisor who, in an emergency, assumes the duties as On-Scene Incident Commander.  Westlake CA&O/Monomers is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can count on pooled resources from surrounding plants.  The Calvert City Fire Department is also a responding party to emergencies if needed.  As a member of the Marshall County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Westlake participates in drills with emergency responders.   Disaster Emergency Service (DES), LEPC, and the Calvert City Fire Department members periodically tour the facility to familiarize themselves.\n\nWestlake also uses an internal auditing program to evaluate opportunities to improve safety performance.  Westlake plans to continue using its proven management systems and intra-plant communications as a means to continue to improve safety performance in protecting its workforce, surrounding community, and the environment."
