(OHLP) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  OHLP management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the plant, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the plant and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Isom Plant is one of many facilities owned and operated by OHLP.  At the Isom Plant, butane is received by pipeline and converted into isobutane.  The isobutane is shipped out by pipeline to various customers.  Hydrogen is stored at the facility; however, the amount is below the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nButane (reported in the RMP as a flammable mixture of n-butane, iso-pentane and pentane), isobutane, and Y-grade, (a flammable mixture consisting of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane) are the flammable substances regulated under the RMP that are present at the Isom Plant in amounts above the RMP threshold quantity. There are no RMP toxic chemicals present at the plant in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantity.  Sodium hydroxide and perchlorethylene are stored on site; however, these are not listed RMP substances.  The plant is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAccide"

These high standards include:\r\n\r\n-  Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \r\n-  Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n-  Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-  Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Isom Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this plant include:\r\n\r\n-  Minimizing the possibility of fire by providing fire detectors and gas detectors throughout the plant to detect flames.\r\n-  Minimizing the possibility of fire by providing fire water monitors throughout the plant for fire fighting.\r\n-  Monitoring all the storage tanks and vessels for pressure, temperature, and liquid level.  Providing high and low level alarms, high pressure alarms, and high temperature alarms on all the storage tanks and process vessels.. \r\n-  Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\r\n-  Providing a siren system for plant evacuation during emergency situations.\r\n-  Providing uninterrupted power supply for all critical controls"
