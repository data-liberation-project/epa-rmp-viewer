If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Franklin County LEPC, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 450,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\n     a. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximim quantity released would be 130,000 pounds,  which represent the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario: a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance  to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 pp ) is .30 miles.\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program.\n\n    The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute , In.,(ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occup"

The OSHA standard is referenced in thi RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.Five-year Accident Histiory.\n\n     There have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility;nor, to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, ore environmental damage.\n\n6.Emergency Response Program.\n\n      The Facility has:\n      a.A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n      b.Provided state and local authorities with the empergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Change to Improve Safety.\n\n      Safety improvments are an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance and safe conditions of our equipment. There are no addtional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time.\n\n8.For futher information contact: David Karr @402-756-8700."
