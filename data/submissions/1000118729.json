We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Opelika Terminal is located at 5565 Alabama Highway 51, Opelika, AL 36801 in Lee County.\n\nThe Opelika Terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane under pressure, and the loading of propane tank trucks.   The facility receives, stores and distributes LPG.  The propane storage tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.  \n\nThe facility consists of pressure storage tanks, a truck loading dock, associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  The storage terminal also has an odorant injection system used to inject ethyl mercaptan into the tanker trucks during the loading operation. \n\nThe process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Par"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design of the proposed process vessels.\n\nThe only listed flammable substances which is present above the threshold quantities at the Opelika Terminal is propane.  Ethyl mercaptan is also present on site as a propane odorant, but is kept at a level below the threshold quantity in the RMP Regulation.\n\nDue to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Opelika Terminal is being registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 1 facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Opelika Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Opelika Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Opelika Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire detectors\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\n* Terminal fire detection system\n* Terminal emergency shutdown (ESD) system with multiple activation points\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Opelika Terminal maintains a writte"

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Opelika Terminal is coordinated with the Lee County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Opelika Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Opelika Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Opelika Terminal.\n\n* No changes are planned."
