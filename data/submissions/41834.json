The system described in this submittal is an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system utilized in the production of dairy products such as milk.  Plains Dairy Products is committed to employee safety, protection of public health and the environment.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is listed as a regulated substance in 40 CFR 68.115 with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The design and construction of the system is in accordance with the applicable guidelines and recommendations of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians who are qualified and trained in accordance with the requirements OSHA, 1910.119.  These operators continuously monitor the system for any indication of leaks or equipment problems using a process control system and permanent, continuous ammonia detectors capable of distinguishing the presence of ammonia in the atmosphere down to a few parts per million.  In addition, the system is visually inspected via a walk-through checklist on a daily basis.  Any indication of deviation from process set points or leaks would result in the immediate isolation of the problem from the remainder of the system for prompt repair.  Design, maintenance, repair, and operation of the system are conducted in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals).  In the event that a leak should occur in the system in spite of precautions taken, the system is equipped with ammonia detectors, which are located at strategic points throughout the facility.  These ammonia detectors "

Plains Dairy Products has implemented an Emergency Action Plan to be followed in the unlikely event of an accident or release.  This Emergency Action Plan describes the notification protocol to be used in the event of an ammonia release, and the procedures to be followed to contain or stop the release.  The notifications in the event of a sudden release of over 100 lbs of ammonia would include the local fire department, the Potter/Randall County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the State Emergency Response Commission, and the National Response Center.  The fire department and the Potter/Randall County LEPC have been provided with copies of the Emergency Response Plan.  The fire department and the LEPC have been briefed on the contents of the Emergency Action Plan."
