The Mercedes emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the communtity. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Mercedes Water Filtration Plant is located at 208 Illinois, Mercedes, Hidalgo County, Texas. The chlorination building at the Water Filtration Plant consists of a three-walled canopy structure facing south that is located on the west of the facility. Four, one-ton cylinders of chlorine are stored in the facility. Only two, one-ton containers are connected to the system at one time. These are located inside the walled canopy structure. Of the remaining two, one, one-ton cylinder is operational and the other one is used as backup. The chlorine containers have manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency and a chlorine alarm will be triggered if a release occurs. Emergency air supply and power are available. The facility is manned 18 hours a day, and operators inspect the chlorination building daily. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office and workroom located approximately 100 feet and 200 feet, respectively, away from the chlorination building.\n\nThe general Mercedes Water Filtration Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements: a high level of training of the operators; a preventive maintenance program; the use of state of the art process and safety equipment; the use of accurate and effective operating procedures,written with the participation of the operators; a performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures; and the implementation of on audit and inspection program.\n\nChemical s"

Both of these entities are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annally."
