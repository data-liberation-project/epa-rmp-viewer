('68.155(a) ).\n\nSoutheast Frozen Foods, Inc. prevents accidental releases through on the job training of refrigeration personnel and ongoing inspection and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).\n\n6.2 Source and regulated substances handled ('68.155(b)).\n\nApproximately 14,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc. facility.\n\n6.3 Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios ('68.155(c)).\n\n6.3.1 Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nHigh pressure receiver #1, located inside the engine room, contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This tank holds approximately 3,685 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia when 50% full under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 181 psig and 95 0F.  The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute period.\n\nThe dispersion model, \"Screen3\", predicted, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability class F, the anhydrous ammonia release may travel 0.6 miles from the point of release (See: Appendix B).  Approximately 5,500 people, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A list of schools, churches, parks, etc. that lie within the radius to the toxic endpoint are listed in A"

      "SummaryText": "ppendix C. \n\n6.3.2 Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario for Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc. was selected to involve a relief valve release on the RECO compressor inside the engine room.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 psi and 250 0F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 1.25 inches) of approximately 273 lbs./min. from two-phase (gas/liquid) choked flow tables.  It is estimated that the supply line containing the relief valve could be isolated in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators onsite, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 2,730 lbs.  The Screen3 air dispersion model predicted, with a wind speed of 6 mph and atmospheric stability class D, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.18 miles.  Approximately 650 people reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia).  A list of schools, churches, parks, etc. that are located within the radius to the toxic endpoint are listed in Section 9.0. \n\n6.4 Accidental release prevention program ('68.155(d)).\n\nSoutheast Frozen Foods, Inc. standard policy requires daily monitoring and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees, or contracted services personnel, in accordance with OSHA and IIAR  guidelines.  Necessary repairs to the refrigeration system are made in a prompt, safe manner.\n\n6.5 5 year accidental history ('68.155(e)).\n\nNo releases or accidents, involving anhydrous ammonia, that are reportable in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP Rule), have occurred at this facility.\n\n6.6 Emergency response program ('68.155(f)).\n\n6.6.1 During normal workday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (public address system) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Miami Fire and Rescue Department (nearest station to SEFF is the Norland Station #38, 575 NW 199th St"

Powerline Rd., Deerfield Beach, FL 33442, (305) 377-4541) also monitors the anhydrous ammonia detector alarms on a continuous basis. \n\n6.6.2 Red Cross shelter resources in the North Miami Beach area consists of pre-arranged service agreements with the local school board and some local churches.  Schools that would serve as a Red Cross shelter would provide space in gymnasiums and two days worth of cafeteria food to shelter and feed inhabitants.  Churches that would serve as a shelter would have food shipped in or supplied by a local vendor under contract.  In addition, the local Red Cross office warehouse is capable of supplying extra food, cots, basic first-aid supplies, and blankets, with access to the Broward County Red Cross supplies if needed.  An emergency management official (HAZMAT Team, Fire Department, Police Department, etc.) would decide if sheltering in place or evacuation and sheltering is required in a given emergency.  The OEM (Office of Emergency Management) would then direct the Red Cross to activate the shelter(s) determined to be located at a safe distance from the hot area.  Reference:  Red Cross Office of Dade County and Florida Keys, Inaki Rezola, Disaster Services, (305) 644-1200.\n\n6.7 Planned changes to improve safety ('68.155(g)).\n\nFuture plans to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at Southeast Frozen Foods, Inc. consist of updating and coordinating an emergency response plan with Dade County Office of Emergency Management.  Other plans include annual operator refresher training, hazardous materials technician and incident commander training, and refrigeration system process safety management program inspection audit annually."
