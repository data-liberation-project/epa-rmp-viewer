Oxy Vinyls is wholly owned by Occidental Chemical (OxyChem) Corporation.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (A? 68.155(a))\n\n\n\nOxy Vinyls has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Pedricktown PVC facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), the requirements of OSHA 1910.119 and the requirements of New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA)RMP program.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Pedricktown PVC facility.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (A? 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe Oxy Vinyls Pedricktown PVC facility consists of a single PVC resin production plant that is wholly owned by OxyChem.  OxyChem operates only the Oxy Vinyls Suspension PVC Resin plant at the site.  The facility handles two (2) substances that are regulated by the RMP rule.  These substances are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (A? 68.155(c))\n\n\n\nThe Oxy Vinyls Pedricktown PVC facility's prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nManagement of Change\n\nPr"

The team is comprised of employees from OxyVinyls and two other co-located site companies, PolyOne and Lubrizol.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  In addition, the OxyVinyls Pedricktown PVC facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (SSP) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n\nThe facility is a member of the Oldmans Township Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (A? 68.155(f))\n\n\n\nThe OxyVinyls Pedricktown PVC facility constantly works to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from all employees. Specific changes include installation of additional process controls and enhancements related to modernization projects.\n\n\n\nCertification Statement\n\n\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's know"
