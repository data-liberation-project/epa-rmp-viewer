The following is a summary of these elements and a description of the management system that is in place to implement the prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nActive employee participation is regarded as essential to the continuous improvement \n\nof the LAR PSM program, and hence in the  prevention of accidents. LAR has a written employee participation policy that outlines the many ways in which employees are involved in the accident prevention program, and employees have access to all information generated within the program. \n\n\n\nAll Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)teams include at minimum an experienced unit operator, facilitator knowledgeable in the Hazop method and unit engineer. Employees are also members of teams formed for compliance audits,incident investigations, and pre-startup safety reviews. The plant emergency response team is comprised of qualified employees who receive specialized training and participate in emergency drills. Employees are expected to report incidents and near miss situations that may occur, as well as any safety concerns and suggestions they may have. \n\n\n\nEmployee assistance is enlisted to develop training programs and operating procedures and compile other critical process information. Additionally, LAR has various safety programs designed to increase plant safety by encouraging employee involvement.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLAR maintains key technical documents that contain information essential to safe operation of the various processes. This information is accessible to employees to facilitate the identification and understanding of hazards posed by chemicals used or produced in the processes and includes chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information.\n\n\n\nMaterial Safety"

MSDSs include information regarding a chemical's toxicity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability, permissible exposure limits, hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing with other materials, and other physical data.\n\n\n\nOperating Information manuals and refinery process overviews are maintained for the various process units. Information available includes process flow diagrams, hazards associated with the process, safe operating limits for process parameters, consequences of deviation from design criteria, controls, locations of safety equipment and inventory.\n\n\n\nEquipment design and construction documents on file include information such as process and instrumentation diagrams,construction specifications and materials, and electrical classifications.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nLAR conducts a comprehensive program to identify potential hazards that may be associated with processes in the various units and thereby control/properly manage them. The Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique is the type of PHA utilized at LAR to ensure that a systematic study of each process is carried out. The HAZOP analysis is recognized by experts as a very comprehensive hazard evaluation technique. The typical HAZOP team includes a knowledgeable operator and unit engineer who systematically analyze detailed  process drawings to identify potential hazards. These potential hazards are assigned a \n\nrisk rank according to specified criteria. The team evaluates accident prevention and mitigation measures already in place and makes recommendations if they believe additional measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nFindings of the team are documented and reviewed by management for resolution. Hazards assigned the highest risk rank are given priority, thereby ensuring that each hazard receives the appropriate attention. All approved mitigation measures are tracked to completion. Doc"

Again, documented findings are forwarded to management to ensure that critical mitigation recommendations are implemented.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nLAR has set forth detailed written procedures with step-by-step instructions for the various modes of process operations, including startup, normal and temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown, and normal shutdown. These procedures are accessible to employees for reference and training and kept current by revisions implemented through the management of change process, periodic review, and annual accuracy certification.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nAll employees of LAR that are involved in operating a process are trained in the process and its operating procedures. This training emphas safety and health hazard issues, emergency operations,and safe work practices. Refresher training is provided at least every three years to maintain a clear understanding of current operations and any process modifications that may have occurred. Employee comprehension of training is verified, and documentation is maintained. Additionally, operating employees receive required safety training routinely.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nContractors are utilized at LAR to supplement employees when increased or specialized activities are conducted.

Managed changes include those to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures and facilities. Special consideration is given to the technical basis for the change, as well as safety and health impacts, operating procedure modifications, time period for the change and authorization requirements. All changes \n\nare reviewed and approved by knowledgeable personnel from various disciplines to ensure that potential new hazards are managed and any controls in place are not adversely affected. Affected employees and contract workers receive training on the change prior to its implementation. In addition, process safety information and operating procedures \n\nare revised to reflect any changes.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nShould an incident occur that results in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of regulated substances, LAR promptly begins a thorough investigation. A knowledgeable investigation team determines the cause and develops corrective action recommendations to prevent recurrence. Refinery Management tracks the resolution of corrective actions. Investigation findings are reviewed with all personnel who could be affected.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nAudits to ensure the proper functioning of the accident prevention program are conducted \n\nat LAR at least every three years. A cross functional audit team carefully reviews facility practices and documents findings for management's review and implementation. Resulting corrective actions are electronically tracked until completion. The two most recent audit repo"

All near misses that involve environmental, health or safety releases have been carefully investigated and evaluated to prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery maintains a written emergency response program that is in place \n\nto protect worker and public safety as well as the process and the environment. The program  consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after  an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, the public, and post  incident cleanup and decontamination procedures. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated based on modifications to refinery   processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program is reviewed on an annual basis.
