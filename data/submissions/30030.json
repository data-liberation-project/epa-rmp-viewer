The cylinders for both of these chemicals are stored outside, under cover in close proximity to the south entrance of the chemical feed room and are clearly identified as either empty or full .   Cylinders that are in use are housed inside the chemical feed room on a scale to track the usage and the amount of gases residing in the cylinders.  This weight is logged on a daily basis and again whenever cylinders are changed out.  Most of the time the on-premise stock of chlorine gas consists of six one-ton cylinders and twelve one-hundred-and-fifty pound cylinders.  The sulfur dioxide gas cylinders stored on site usually consist of three one-ton cylinders and three one-hundred-and-fifty pound cylinders.   \n\nProtecting the plant personnel and the citizens of Pullman is a high priority.  Personnel at the plant receive training on the proper handling of the gases, procedures for changing the cylinders, and stopping leaks which may occur during change-out of cylinders.  Material Safety Data Sheets are kept on site for staff to refer to if the need should arise.  The City of Pullman also has a preventive maintenance program, which provides for a longer working life for the equipment and insurance that the equipment is working properly on a daily basis.  The City of Pullman Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel have compiled an excellent safety record in regard to the use of and storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas.  In the twenty-year history of this process no reportable incidents have occurred. Plant personnel have achieved this record as a result of the safety procedures that are in place and the commitment of plant personnel.  Safety procedures are re-evaluated on a yearly basis.\n\nIf  some accident should occur which is beyond the capability"
