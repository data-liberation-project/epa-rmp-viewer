(\"Plains\"), is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations. Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Bumstead Rail Terminal is owned by Plains LPG Services, L.P. and operated by Plains Marketing Canada, L.P. At the terminal, propane and butane are received via railcar and stored in pressure tanks. Propane and butane are transferred by pipeline to the cavern facility. Propane and butane are the only substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Bumstead Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the terminal; however, the amount stored is below threshold quantity. The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. There are two processes at the facility - LPG Storage Terminal and Rail storage/loading & unloading area. There is 30 railcar capacity inside the facility. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\n\n?"

Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since Plains purchased the terminal. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane or butane release has occurred at the Bumstead Storage Terminal within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which is coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Rural Metro Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Maricopa LEPC, Arizona State Police, and the Arizona Corporation Commission. The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
