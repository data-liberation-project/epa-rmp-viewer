              "Description": "Sistersville's prevention program for Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This includes an employee participation program which covers process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires the assembly of PSM required information prior to a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and retention of Key Process Safety Information (PSI) for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgeable regarding the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Multiple techniques for PHA?s are used including What If, HAZOP, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis. The PHA?s are conducted to analyze potential causes and consequences of explosions, fires, releases of flammable or toxic chemicals, and major spills of hazardous chemicals. Major process hazards are formally documented through a site operational safety standard program. Unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site critical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  A MOC program is maintained which includes pre-startup, facility change review and replacement in kind packages utilized for changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including hot-work, hazardous work permits, confined space entry, master tag/lockout and line breaking are in place and followed by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment. Types of training conducted include classroom, on the job, and computer-based training. Types of competency testing used includes written test, oral test, demonstration, and observation. Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and includes assessments of the PSM program at the site. Prevention is also accomplished through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills using alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

This includes an employee participation program which covers process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires the assembly of PSM required information prior to a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and retention of Key Process Safety Information (PSI) for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgeable regarding the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Multiple techniques for PHA?s are used including What If, HAZOP, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis. The PHA?s are conducted to analyze potential causes and consequences of explosions, fires, releases of flammable or toxic chemicals, and major spills of hazardous chemicals. Major process hazards are formally documented through a site operational safety standard program. Unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site critical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  A MOC program is maintained which includes pre-startup, facility change review and replacement in kind packages utilized for changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including hot-work, hazardous work permits, confined space entry, master tag/lockout and line breaking are in place and followed by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment. Types of training conducted include classroom, on the job, and computer-based training. Types of competency testing used includes written test, oral test, demonstration, and observation. Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and includes assessments of the PSM program at the site. Prevention is also accomplished through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills using alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

Major process hazards are formally documented through a site operational safety standard program. Unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site critical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  A MOC program is maintained which includes pre-startup, facility change review and replacement in kind packages utilized for changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including hot-work, hazardous work permits, confined space entry, master tag/lockout and line breaking are in place and followed by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment. Types of training conducted include classroom, on the job, and computer-based training. Types of competency testing used includes written test, oral test, demonstration, and observation. Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and includes assessments of the PSM program at the site. Prevention is also accomplished through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills using alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

              "Description": "Sistersville's prevention program for Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This includes an employee participation program which covers process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires the assembly of PSM required information prior to a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and retention of Key Process Safety Information (PSI) for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgeable regarding the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Multiple techniques for PHA?s are used including What If, HAZOP, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis. The PHA?s are conducted to analyze potential causes and consequences of explosions, fires, releases of flammable or toxic chemicals, and major spills of hazardous chemicals. Major process hazards are formally documented through a site operational safety standard program. Unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site critical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  A MOC program is maintained which includes pre-startup, facility change review and replacement in kind packages utilized for changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including hot-work, hazardous work permits, confined space entry, master tag/lockout and line breaking are in place and followed by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment. Types of training conducted include classroom, on the job, and computer-based training. Types of competency testing used includes written test, oral test, demonstration, and observation. Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and includes assessments of the PSM program at the site. Prevention is also accomplished through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills using alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

Management \n\nrepresentatives participate in incident reviews based upon the severity of the event. The \n\ninvestigation reports include date of the incident, date the investigation began, incident description, \n\nfactors contributing to the incident, and recommendations to prevent the incident(s) from \n\nreoccurring. Investigation findings are reviewed with effected personnel, including applicable \n\ncontractors and are retained for at least five years.\n\nMPM maintains a program to allow employees access to information considered as \"trade secret\" \n\nupon request of the employee. MPM undergoes qualifying process safety audits every 3 years in \n\naccordance with OSHA and EPA requirements. Additional audits are performed on a periodic \n\nbasis through the plants internal audit program. MPM prepares reports of the audit findings and \n\nretains the two most recent reports and documents responses to compliance audit findings and \n\ncorrects deficiencies.\n\nMPM maintains the ongoing integrity of the equipment through its mechanical integrity program. \n\nChemical processes are well documented through R&D Definitions of Technology, which are \n\nshared with operating departments prior to implementation of a new process. Primary mitigation \n\nfor hazard events is relief devices, water spray, foam protection and secondary containment. Major \n\nprocess hazards identified by PHA teams are documented in mandatory Operational Safety \n\nStandards that define to operations the required mitigations to prevent hazardous situations. The \n\nfacilities main operational areas are run and monitored utilizing computerized process control \n\nsystems to ensure that any deviations from the intended safe operating conditions (e.g., pressure, \n\ntemperature, flow rate, "

As part of this program, we have \n\ndeveloped and implemented written programs to train all our employees in the proper response to \n\nan incident. The site has also developed and trained more extensively a smaller number of \n\nemployees to act as an emergency brigade to provide more expertise in responding to more \n\nsignificant events both on and off site. This brigade is equipped with equipment needed to respond \n\nto emergencies. MPM maintains a trained emergency brigade on site 24 hours per day, seven days \n\na week. MPM has emergency plans and procedures in place and has communicated those with \n\nlocal regulating agencies. Mutual aid agreements exist with both neighboring communities and \n\nindustrial entities in the region. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nSistersville has several elements of the management system of the accident prevent program in \n\nplace for continuing sitewide safety improvement. The following elements of the PSM/RMP plans \n\nare used to improve safety for workers and ensure protection of the environment: Process Hazard \n\nAnalysis (PHA), Management of Change (MOC), Compliance Audits, and Training Programs."
