(Cytec) plant in Piedmont, South Carolina has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources that facility management invests in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident in coordination with outside emergency response agencies and contractors.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Cytec Engineered Materials Inc. plant is located at 7139 Augusta Road, Piedmont, South Carolina  9673.  The plant is owned by Solvay.  Various chemicals are processed to produce carbon fibers for use in the aerospace industry.  Carbon fiber is a strong, light-weight material that when used to replace metal in aircraft results in reduced fuel usage while maintaining a secure, safe structure.  \n\nThe regulated substance at the plant in excess of the threshold quantity is acrylonitrile.  Acrylonitrile is brought to the facility by tank truck or railcar and stored in an atmospheric aboveground storage tank and is fed to reactors where it is converted to acrylic polymer suitable for spinning and converting to carbon fiber.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Cytec Piedmont plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and descri"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.  \n\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  \n\nIn addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personnel safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personnel safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  Each work group participates in monthly safety meetings.  Members from a work group are responsible for determining the topics and then presenting the information to their co-workers.  Topics range from safety issues off-the-job to safety issues in the workplace.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cytec Piedmont plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  There is documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Cytec Piedmont plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant uses a variety of PHA analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  These analysis techniques are recognized as systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Cytec plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  \n\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Cytec plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
