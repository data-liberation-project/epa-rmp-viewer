This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes.  The Boise Packaging and Newsprint, LLC (Boise) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nBoise Packaging and Newsprint, LLC owns and operates the DeRidder Paper Mill (the Mill) located in Beauregard Parish, Louisiana.  The Mill produces linerboard and newsprint products.  The Mill purchases pine wood grown in the region, chips the timber, utilizes mechanical and chemical methods to produce pulp from wood fibers and processes the pulp into linerboard and newsprint products.  Methods used in the pulping process include cutting, debarking, chipping, grinding, thermomechanical processes and cooking.  \r\n\r\nSome newsprint pulp is bleached.  Boise uses chlorine dioxide as the primary bleaching agent.    \r\n\r\nChanges to facility processes have been evaluated to determine if any new regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeding the threshold quantity would be brought into the Mill.  Based on process knowledge of the changes, the DeRidder Mill did not identify any listed flammable substances due to the process changes.  However, chlorine dioxide is manufactured and stored at the Mill above the threshold quantity.  In addition, chlorine is stored on site above the threshold quantity and is used for mill water treatment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nBoth chlorine and chlorine dioxide are stored above threshold quant"

In addition, the Mill is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM).  Therefore, the DeRidder Paper Mill is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances\r\n\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill does not have any flammable substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case release scenarios for flammable substances is not required.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nChlorine and chlorine dioxide WCR Scenario \r\n\r\nThe endpoints for a worst-case release of chlorine and chlorine dioxide are based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association. The ERPG-2 for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L. The ERPG-2 for chlorine dioxide is 0.0028 mg/L.\r\n\r\nComparisons of the worst-case DTE radii for chlorine and chlorine dioxide verified chlorine dioxide would disperse with a 21.43% larger endpoint area than chlorine.Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for chlorine dioxide and its resulting DTE were chosen as the worst-case release scenario for the Mill.   \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\r\n\r\nThe following conditions are considered for alternative release scenarios:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tRelease rate dependent upon scenario;\r\n\u00b7\tUse of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source;\r\n\u00b7\tActual release height; and\r\n\u00b7\tConsideration of active and passive mit"

Therefore, analysis of regulated flammable substances is not required.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  The regulated toxic substances at the Mill are chlorine and chlorine dioxide.  Hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenarios of chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been identified for the Mill. \r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the DeRidder Paper Mill.  Because the processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the DeRidder Paper Mill's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communication is encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\r\nThe Mill strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Hazardous Materials Team (HazMat Teams), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct"

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.\r\nThe Mill keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \r\nThe Mill also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill"

      "SummaryText": "has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nThe Mill uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios that are assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed.  The review process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\r\nTraining\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the DeRidder Paper Mill has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in pulp and paper operations. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least annually.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\nContractors\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Mill has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workpl"

In addition, the Mill evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Mill personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Mill has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the DeRidder Paper Mill periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Mill management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
