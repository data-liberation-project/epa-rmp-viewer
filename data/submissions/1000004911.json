      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\r\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and Aqueous Ammonia Storage System.  The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 21,800 gallon (gal) storage tank (bullet tank) at the site.  The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity to 85 percent (%) of the fill capacity for both covered processes.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 95,430 pounds (lbs).  Aqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 21,250 gal above-ground storage tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 136,820 lbs.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 24% active ingredient by weight, is 22,400 lbs.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\nWorst-Case/Alternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\r\nPer CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario have been defined for each process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the facility has recognized"

      "SummaryText": "these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\r\nAdditionally, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an anhydrous or aqueous ammonia release.  The facility utilizes a pressure relief valve, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutdown systems.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2 and Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.
