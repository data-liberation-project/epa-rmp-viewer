Black Dog Generating Plant takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of chemicals.  Black Dog Generating Plant has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  The emergency procedures are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes when they occur.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nBlack Dog Generating Plant is an electric generating plant that utilizes coal-fired and natural gas-fired combined cycle generating technology.  As part of the combined-cycle technology, the facility uses 29% aqueous ammonia solution, which is regulated under the RMP rule and qualifies for Program 2 requirements.  The ammonia is used for flue gas treatment and is stored in a 20,000 gallon storage tank with a possible maximum inventory of 151,242 pounds.\n\n\n\nPrevention Steps for Aqueous\n\nThe prevention program is described in the Black Dog Generating Plant RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n-- Safety Information has been collected and summarized in the RMP manual.\n\n-- Hazard Review - The initial hazard review for the ammonia system was conducted in February 2002 prior to system startup.  The recommendations of the hazard review were addressed prior to initial delivery of ammonia to the facility. Revalidations of the hazard review were conducted in October 2006 and September 2011.  The recommendations are still being implemented from the most recent review.\n\n--"

      "SummaryText": " Operating procedures for the ammonia system are available in the RMP manual.\n\n-- Training was conducted for personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia system.\n\n-- Maintenance program through the plant computerized work order/preventive maintenance system to ensure that the ammonia system equipment is maintained in good, safe working condition.\n\n--Incident investigation procedures for the investigation of any catastrophic (or potentially catastrophic) incident associated with the ammonia system, using the company incident investigation process.\n\n-- Compliance audits to be conducted at least once every three years to ensure continued compliance of the facility's ammonia system RMP program.  The most recent audit was conducted in April 2011.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\nThe RMP rule requires the accident history for the five-year period prior to the submittal of this Risk Management Plan.  The ammonia system was installed in 2002 and there have been no accidents to report to date.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP manual and meets the requirement of the RMP rule.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases to the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect changes.  Emergency response training for facility employees is conducted annually.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for change to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings are held regularly at the facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate or minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\n\n\nThe original 2002 hazard review was reviewed for revalidation in 2"
