Grady's employees will only handle incipient stage fires that can be handled with portable fire extinguishers and will not respond to larger releases or fires, but will conduct an Emergency Shutdown (ESD) of the facility and contact local emergency responders to respond.  The facility does not contain any regulated toxic substances, but only flammable substances above the threshold quantity (as listed in 40 CFR \u00a768.130).\r\nEmergency contact information of Fire, Police and Sheriff Departments as well as Hospitals for Major adjacent cities and local Emergency Planning Committee is included in the EAP\r\nThe most recent review of the EAP was done on November 22, 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nG.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nThe Grady Plant is committed to continuously improve the safe handling of the flammable mixtures in the process by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment; as well as periodic safety reviews and the incident investiga"

Affected personnel and contractors are trained in the changes before the change is implemented.  \r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) conducted by appropriate employees, as spelled out in the facility's PSSR procedure. \r\nThe facility has an active accident/incident prevention program.  Each incident and near miss associated with the process area is evaluated and, if it meets pre-defined criteria, a team-based investigation is performed.  The investigation's purpose is to identify root and contributing causes and to make recommendations to prevent future recurrence.  Recommendations from the Incident Investigation are tracked to closure.\r\nEmployees are active in all aspects of process safety, including safe work permitting, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, mechanical integrity and management of change.  \r\nAdditionally, contractors are involved in many aspects of the programs.
