      "SummaryText": "Calvert City Main Production Facility\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\n1.\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Wacker Chemical Corporation, Polymers Division (Wacker) plant, which is located on Highway 95 in Calvert City is a Program 3 facility in the Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Under RMP, the Calvert City plant is classified as two sources:  \n\n1.\tThe main plant stationary source on Highway 95 and\n2.\tThe storage, pipeline, and barge unloading source at the Tennessee River. \n\nThe largest quantity raw material feedstock, Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), is used in the production of Wacker's VAE Emulsions and Sekisui Polyvinyl Alcohol.  Ethylene and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) are also used in the production of VAE and EVCL Emulsions.  VAM, VCM, and ethylene, in the quantities handled at this facility, are considered hazardous by EPA under the Risk Management Rule.  \n\nWacker is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, Commonwealth of Kentucky, and local rules and regulations.  The Wacker Site Manager at the Calvert City plant is responsible for facility operation.  The Wacker Environmental manager reports to the Site Manager and has overall responsibility for compliance with all aspects of the facility's Risk Management Plan. \n\nAs a site that is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, the Calvert City plant strives to prevent chemical emergencies.  Prevention of chemical emergencies includes specifying that all equipment, piping, vessels, tanks, etc. meet all applicable design codes and specifications.  Documentation of these codes and specifications form the basis of our process safety information including flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, process descriptions, and other documentation.

      "SummaryText": "selected were chosen based on the criteria established in the regulation.  \n\n2.\t The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe stationary source is the Wacker main production facility located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, Kentucky.  The RMP covered processes are the Dispersions unit and the VAM storage and distribution unit.  \n\nIn the Disperions unit, VAM, ethylene, and/or VCM is batch polymerized in water to form a co-polymer emulsion product.  A number of other chemicals that are not covered by the RMP regulations, may be used to adjust emulsions product properties for specific end uses.  Emulsions products are used in many applications including adhesives, latex paints, and paper coatings.  \n\nThe VAM storage and distribution area at the main production facility receives VAM from tanks at the Tennessee River and stores it on site to continuously supply the dispersions production facility and the Sekisui PVOH production facility.  \n\nThe regulated substances handled at this stationary source are:\n\u00c2\u00b7Vinyl Acetate with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 433,000 pounds.  \n\u00c2\u00b7Ethylene with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 237,000 pounds\n\u00c2\u00b7Vinyl Chloride with a maximum quantity in an individual process of 60,000 pounds\n\n3.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:\n\nKey to the plant's prevention programs are the layers of protection provided for each process.  This protection starts with the facility design and construction.  Wacker meets or exceeds all design and construction codes when implementing new projects in the plant.   A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of process equipment, tanks, vessels, and piping.  These checks are done using non-destructive testing techniques and kept in the permanent equipment files.  \n\nTrained operators working with current operating procedures and process safety information keep the processes operating safe"

Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to keep the process within these limits and provide the information and control to properly operate each process in normal, startup/shutdown, and emergency conditions.  Instrumentation alarms alert plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process upsets.  \n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including critical interlocks that activate automatic shutdowns, pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arrestors are in place to safely control upset conditions.  Process areas are covered by fire sensors and flammable vapor sensors, fire sprinkler systems, monitor nozzles, dry chemical extinguishers, etc.  Containment dikes around storage tanks and process areas are curbed to contain small spills and direct them to drains to the plant's chemical sewer and the wastewater treatment plant.  \n\nEach process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction, and start-up.  All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made.  At periods not to exceed five years, Operational Plant Hazard Reviews (OPHR's) are conducted by multi-disciplinary teams.  \n\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the plant and corporate levels.  These audits are documented as part of the basic safety process with corrective action defined and tracked through the plant management systems.  \n\n4.\tFive year accident history:\n\nNone of the stationary sources or covered processes at the Wacker plant at Calvert City has had an incident in the last five years that would be reported under RMP.  There have been no releases of VAM, ethylene, or VCM that have had any off-site consequences, resulted in any employee injuries, or resulted in any significant equipment damage.  \n\n5.\tThe emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergenc"

Employees are regularly trained, certified, and subject to random substance abuse checks to ensure the safety of the plant.  Our Polymers Safety Process (PSP) contains many other elements including management of change, hot work procedures, and regular process hazards analysis using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology.  All contractors working at the plant are subject to the same rules and procedures that Wacker employees must follow under the contractor safety program.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training and qualifications for on-site employees.  Wacker shares emergency response resources on the plant site with the Sekisui PVOH plant and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.  Wacker, Air Products and Sekisui participate in a partnership among the Calvert City area industries named the Calvert City Industrial Mutual Aid Program or CIMAP.  This organization collaborates with community emergency responders and citizens to form a strong Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC.

There are at least 16 trained emergency responders on the fire and rescue squad that are divided into shift and day workers.  Each shift has a fire and rescue squad that is led by the shift safety officer.  In an emergency, the Air Products and Chemicals safety officer assumes on-scene command of any incident.  \n\nOn-site emergency resources include a fire/foam truck, a rescue truck, and a Hazmat Response trailer.  In addition to these resources, Wacker is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can draw from pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities.  As a member of the LEPC, Wacker regularly stages emergency response drills on and off the plant site with emergency responders from the public and private sector.  LEPC members and other emergency responders regularly tour the facility to familiarize themselves with the plant, its hazardous materials, equipment, layout, personnel, and emergency procedures.  \n\n6.\tPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe process safety information and systems are evaluated regularly through the Operational Plant Hazard Reviews, with industry wide changes in standards, and as a result of incidents that have occurred within the chemical industry.  The VAM storage tanks and the Dispersions plant have no outstanding upgrade recommendations.  \n\nThe Calvert Area Emergency Warning System (CAEWS) is an emergency notification system to alert the community of a chemical and/or weather related emergency.  The system is composed of a siren network in Calvert City and Livingston County that is activated by the 911 operator.  The 911 operator is backed up by the safety officer at Air Products, who can also activate the system.

Once a citizen has heard the siren, they can tune to the local Calvert City radio station (WCCK) and listen for special instructions.  The sirens are routinely tested on day per month.   \n\nCAEWS also has a telephone notification system that can be activated by any of the ten participating plants.  In the event of a chemical emergency, a plant could activate the system to notify everyone in the community within a five-mile radius of the complex.  These calls notify people of the emergency, instruct them to Shelter-in-place, and tune to their local radio station for more information.  The system can make an All-Clear call to notify everyone that the emergency has passed.  In the event of an incident with no off-site consequences, plants can activate the system to notify emergency responders, plant personnel, and the media that no emergency exists."
