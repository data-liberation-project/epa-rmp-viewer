The project consisted of the 820 acre Roy Varner\n\nReservoir and the 7.5-mgd Cornish Creek Water Treatment\n\nFacility, which provides potable water to all residents of\n\nNewton County and some residents of Walton County.  The\n\nplant consists of intake pumps, pulsating clarifiers, dual\n\nmedia filters, a chlorination system for disinfection, a\n\nclearwell and distribution pumps.  The plant began\n\noperations in 1992 and will begin expansion to 15-mgd in\n\n1999.  The facility is owned by Newton County and operated\n\nby the City of Covington.\n\n\n\nChemical Safety\n\nThe City of Covington complies with the Hazardous\n\nCommunications standard set forth by the Occupational Safety\n\nand Health Administration.  Compliance is accomplished by\n\ncompiling a hazardous chemical list, using Material Safety\n\nData Sheets (MSDS's), ensuring that containers are labeled,\n\nand providing employee training.  The purpose of the program\n\nis to alert and educate employees about chemicals in the\n\nworkplace by giving them greater access to information on\n\nthe physical and health hazards of chemicals, safe handling\n\nand storage precautions and emergency first aid procedures.\n\nIt applies to all employees who may be exposed to hazardous\n\nsubstances during the scope of their employment.\n\n\n\nThe Safety/Risk Manager has overall responsibility for the\n\nprogram and provides reviews and updates as needed.  Copies\n\nof the written program can be obtained from the Safety/Risk\n\nManager.    Each department head maintains a list of all\n\nhazardous chemicals used by their departments.  These lists\n\nare updated as necessary.  Each foreman or employee in\n\ncharge has available a list of chemicals applicable to their\n\narea of employment.  The Safety/Risk Manager maintains a\n\nmaster list of all the chemicals.  Material Safety Data\n\nSheets (MSDS) provide specific informa"

Aside from the main\n\nMEDS binder, department heads make their MEDS binder\n\navailable and accessible to their respective employees.\n\n\n\nWorst Case/Alternative Case Releases\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Guidance Document for\n\nWastewater Treatment Plants was used for the off site\n\nanalyses and Land View III was used to estimate population\n\nand public receptors.  It should be noted that Land View III\n\nuses 1990 census data and the current population will most\n\nlikely be greater than indicated. Current, population data\n\nprovided on the Census Bureau website was used to verify the\n\nestimated population from the 1999 report was sufficient for\n\nthis report and represented the current population\n\nestimates.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the failure of a one-ton\n\ncylinder outside the chlorine building, yielding a release\n\nof 2,000 lbs of chlorine to the atmosphere over a period of\n\n10 minutes.  Using the EPA tables, the distance to the\n\nendpoint for rural conditions is 3 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative or more likely release scenario is a leak in\n\none of the ton vessels located within the chlorine building.\n\nFor this analysis it has been assumed chlorine will be\n\nreleased through a ?-in. diameter hole.  Exhibit 4-13 in the\n\nEPA Guidance Document indicates a release rate of\n\napproximately 150 lbs/min.  Since this scenario assumed the\n\nrelease occurred in a building, the release rate can be\n\nreduced to 55 percent of the release rate (EPA Guidance\n\nDocument, Section 4.3).  As a result, the release rate is\n\nreduced to approximately 83 lbs/min and a distance to the\n\nendpoint of 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\n\nActive environmental, health and safety programs with\n\nregards to the safe handling of chlorine and chlorination\n\nequipment are in place at the plant.

Self-\n\ncontained breathing equipment is available wherever gas or\n\nliquid chlorine is in use.  These units are approved by the\n\nNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health\n\n(NIOSH).\n\nu    The two-man rule is used for all connecting and\n\ndisconnecting of chlorine cylinders (two men present, one in\n\nSCBA the other on standby).\n\nu    Adequate ventilation shall be provided at all times.\n\nu    It is optional to use the chlorine detectors (detects\n\nchlorine concentrations so small that they are impossible to\n\nsmell).  A chlorine detector can give early warning, so a\n\nsmall leak can be stopped before it becomes larger).\n\n\n\nOne Ton Chlorine Cylinder Storage:\n\nu    Cool, clean, dry place with adequate ventilation.\n\nu    Away from other chemicals and equipment.\n\nu    Always use lifting clamps or cradles - do not use\n\nropes, cables or chains when moving.\n\nu    Keep the protective cap on the cylinder when it is not\n\nin use.\n\nu    Mark empty containers and store them aside from full\n\ncontainers.\n\n\n\nFirst Aid:\n\nu    First aid for eyes exposed to chlorine is immediate\n\n  irrigation with flowing water for at least 15 minutes, and\n\n  contact a physician immediately.\n\nu    If skin is exposed to liquid chlorine, it can cause\n\nburns.  The skin should be washed with flowing water for 30\n\nminutes.  If the skin is burned, contact a physician\n\nimmediately.  Chlorine gas can become trapped in the\n\nclothing and react with body moisture to form hydrochloric\n\nacid which could burn the skin.  Remove the clothing of the\n\nvictim and wash the body down with water.\n\nu    In case of inhalation, remove the victim to fresh air,\n\nadminister oxygen if available, call a physician or\n\ntransport the injured person to a medical facility."
