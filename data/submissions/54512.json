      "SummaryText": "Facility Descriptionand Regulated Substance:\nThis facility manufactures textile material which is supplied to other facilities for use in tire manufacturing.\nFormaldehyde (37% solution) is an ingredient in a textile treatment dip solution which is applied to a woven\nfabric. The formaldehyde process consists of one 5000 gallon storage tank and associated equipment which\nare located inside the manufacturing building.\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policy\nThis facility compies with 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule) and it is our\npolicy to adhere to all aplicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency involving Formaldehyde was\nto occur, it is our policy to notify the Scottsville Fire Department if outside assistance is necessary.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario is the release of the entire formaldehyde storage container. In this \nscenario, the release would be mitigated by the surrounding dyke and the building. Using EPA's RMP\nComp program, we determined that under these conditions, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be \n0.10 miles. Since the toxic endpoint is very limited due to preventive measures that have been installed, \neven this worst case scenario would not effect nearby public receptors\n\nPrevention Program\nThis facility complies with EPA's Risk Management Rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management \nRule. Additionally the storage tank and process are located inside the building to prevent releases to the\nenvironment. The process is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA's PSM and good \nengineering practices.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThis facility has never had an accident involving Formaldehyde that caused deaths, injuries, property,\nor environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has a spill prevention and response procedure in place which includes employee training\nand coordination with local emergency response."
