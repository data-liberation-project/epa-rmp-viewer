In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. \n\nSunrise Co-op Corporate Mission states \"to provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public\". In order to fulfill this mission, Sunrise C-op provides a corporate Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS)  to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures. EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\n\n Each location has a \"site safety coordinator\" as an extension of the EHS . These coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct monthly safety meetings, conduct employee training, and act as the location's contact with the corporate EHS. The site safety coordinator acts as the location's emergency contact.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site, and is a substance regulated by the EPA requiring our compliance with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in both 1,000 gallon, 1,500 gallon nurse tanks or 560 gallon applicators. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.\n\nThis facility maintains approximately eighteen (18) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and  (6) 560 gallon appl"

      "SummaryText": "icators for customer delivery. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 2 stationary storage tanks (1 @ 30,000  gallons and 1 @ 18,000 gallon storage tank) on site.  The maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tank is 199,680 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 140,000 pounds.\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (the distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted that Sunrise Co-op has never had a release of an entire stationary anhydrous ammonia storage tank from any distribution facility.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 160,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact.  It should be noted Sunrise Co-op has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow "

The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All main storage tank valves and riser valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process, or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification, and on the job training.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off-site.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Sunrise Co-op has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200).

We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures. We will also provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
