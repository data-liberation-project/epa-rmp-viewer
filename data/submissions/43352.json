This information includes construction materials, design limits, and electrical rating of equipment. The combination of appropriately trained personnel, written procedures and PSI data provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance intervals and procedures. Proposed design or process modifications are reviewed through the Management of Change (MOC) process to ensure that safety features and material of construction in the process are not compromised. \n\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  This program systematically examines the process to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage the identified hazards.\n\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant personnel use various PHA processes including the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and Check List techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are initiated and tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nReviews are conducted at least  every  five years  and  will  be conducted at  this  frequency until  the  process  is no longer  operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant maintains written procedures that add"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the MOC process. In addition, the Dollarhide Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter in the DCS System that provides alarm notification for excess process control deviations. This information, along with written operating procedures is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \nTraining\nComplemented by the written procedures the Dollarhide Gas Plant personnel maintain job proficiency through mentoring and training opportunities. New employees are initiated to the process operations through their involvement in the maintenance responsibilities.  Once operations fundamentals are established, the new employees are mentored by a senior plant operator or the plant foreman.  Process operating responsibilities are transferred to the new employee after observations indicate the new employee exhibits sufficient proficiency in the process operations. All operators  periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. \n\n\n \nContractors\nThe Dollarhide Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n1.\tParticipate in Contractor / Visitor Orientation   \n2.\tPerform their work in a safe manner\n3.\tHave appropriate knowledge and skills\n4.\tAware of the hazards in their workplace\n5."
