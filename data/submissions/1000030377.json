This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Glacier Cold Storage, LTD. facility chills and stores a variety of frozen food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The facility utilizes an Ammonia Refrigeration System to provide cooling capabilities.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System is operated as a two stage system.  No chemical reactions occur during the process cycle of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  The operation of a refrigeration system requires controlling the ammonia (NH3) refrigerant pressure and temperature at key points in the system.  High pressure liquid ammonia travels from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) to the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR). From the CPR, the refrigerant is a low pressure, low temperature liquid that is sent to the Evaporators.  Inside the Evaporators, the refrigerant gains heat from the cold rooms and is evaporated at a constant pressure to become a vapor.  This vapor is characterized as a low pressure, low temperature saturated vapor; it leaves the evaporator and enters the Low Pressure Receivers (LPRs).  From the LPRs, the refrigerant is sent to the Booster Compressors, where the refrigerant is compressed.  The Compressed gas passes through the Intercoolers before entering the High Stage Compressors.  The compressed vapor passes through the Knockout pot before entering the condenser where it is condensed at constant pressure back to a saturated liquid before returning to the HPR.  In addition, low temperature liquid ammonia from the HPR and CPR is se"

This refrigeration process is a closed loop system, which prevents contact with other chemicals; however, the anhydrous ammonia does come into contact with lubricating oil.  The anhydrous ammonia and the oil are compatible and no chemical reaction occurs. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nPer the CalARP Regulations one worst-case analysis has been defined.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment in the Compliance Workbook.  This worst-case release scenario is highly unlikely should a worst-case release occur, the sudden rupture and flashing would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment in the Compliance Workbook. \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety systems to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and facility personnel that make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be"

Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n?    There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place without exposing anyone to the anhydrous ammonia. \n\n?    The system utilizes automatic shut-downs that would prevent a deviation from resulting in a release. \n\n?    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary. \n\n?    The system has ammonia sensors that automatically notify an alarm company and activate various alarms and shutdowns. \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been a CalARP-applicable release of anhydrous ammonia at the facility in the past five (5) years.  Refer to the RMP* Submit for more information regarding the incident.\n\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.7 (q), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed by the PHA.\n\n\n\nFLAMMABLES: WORST-CASE\n\nThe use of flammable materials at the facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.
