It is our policy to comply with all federal, state and local laws.  If and emergency were to occur, it is our policy to contact the Fairfax Fire Department.\n\nThis facility is an ag retail business and we store anhydrous ammonia for retail to farmer customer.  Our storage consists of two tanks, a 12000 and a 33000 gallon along with 22 nurse tanks and assocaited pumps, compressors and micellaneous plumbing.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\nOur worst case scenario is the release of 143055  lbs of NH3 should our largest  tank is filled to 85% result in a vapor and liquid release.  This could effect 4,415 resident at an end point of 4.4 miles according to the calculations of EPA's RMP Comp (TM).\n\nThe alternative release scenario:\nOur alternative scenario would be a fill hose rupture causing a maximum release of 2900 lbs of NH3.  This could effect 11 residents at an end point of .3 miles according to EPA's RMP COMP (TM).\n\nThis facility complies with all federal, state and local codes and regulations.  Our facility is inspected twice a year (spring and fall) by an inspector from the state of Iowa.\n\nFive year accident history:\nWe have never had an accident at our facility.\n\nThe emergency response program at our facility:\nIn the event of an emergency at our facility, it is our policy to notify athe Fairfax Fire Department and the LEPC requesting their assistance.  Yearly we have a meeting and training with the Fairfax Fire Department at our location so they know what is expected of them with our facility.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nAdded 8 inch pillars around storage tanks.  Added valve security devises to nurse tanks to help prevent theft and accidental opening"
