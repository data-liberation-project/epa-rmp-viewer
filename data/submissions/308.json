The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Clyde Cooperative Association (Salt Fork) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n7 The maximum quantity stored would be 95,837 pounds in our two 11,000 gallon storage tanks . \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 47,918 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.50 miles.\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History \n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past "

The procedures for filling a nurse tank by liquid pump is similar to the procedures for filling a nurse tank by a compressor.\n\na.    The main difference is that when the tank has reached the proper liquid level you need to follow these procedures:\n\n    (1)    Stop the pump.\n\n    (2)    Close the liquid riser valve.\n\n    (3)    Close the 85% fixed liquid level gauge.\n\n    (4)    Continue with procedures from the compressor procedur"

The general manager shall review and update the offsite consequence analyses at least once every five years.\n\n2.    If changes in processes, quantities stored or handled, or any other aspect of the stationary source might reasonably be expected to increase or decrease the distance to the endpoint by a factor of two or more, the general manager shall complete a revised analysis within six months of the change and submit a revised risk management plan.\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n\n1.    The general manager shall maintain the following records on the offsite consequence analyses:\n\na.
