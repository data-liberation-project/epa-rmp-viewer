The current City of Newark program includes a complete chlorine safety program including extensive operator training, emergency response training, standard operating procedures and chlorine safety equipment.  The chlorine process includes chlorine monitors, alarms and controls.\n\n\n\nThe City of Newark's written Risk Management Program includes all necessary Prevention Program elements, meeting the requirements of EPA and OSHA Process Safety management.  The Prevention Program includes elements such as safety information, standard operating procedures, operator training, preventative maintenance, hot work permits, and other safety programs to ensure that the chlorine process meets the highest possible safety standards.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, the Pequannock Water Pretreatment facilities has not had any chlorine releases with outside impacts within the last five years.\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety for the Pretreatment plant.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe Pequannock Water Pretreatment chlorination facility installed electric actuators on the t"
