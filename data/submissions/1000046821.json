(MOP) operates the Martin Underground Storage Facility (herein after referred to as the Facility or MUS).  The facility handles substances considered hazardous by the U.S. EPA and has implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.\r\n\r\nMUS complies with OHSA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rules in addition to the EPA's RMP rules.  PSM requires that operating procedures be written and updated should any processes or equipment be changed.  A management of change program is followed to ensure that all employees associated with the procedure or equipment change are made aware of the change.  Additionally, the employees are trained on the procedures by competent staff.\r\n\r\nIn addition to training and procedures, the facility has installed redundant safety devices in the process to prevent releases from occurring should equipment fail.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Arcadia Fire Department, and other interested authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nMUS handles Butane, Propane, Iso-Butane, and Refinery Grade Butane (RGB) which is considered to be Butane for the purposes of the RMP and PSM programs.  The chemicals handled are transported to the facility via tanker truck and unloaded into pressurized storage tanks or from pumped from the rail facility to the injection pumps.  From the tanks or the rail facility, the chemicals are transferred, via pumps, to underground storage caverns, also called salt dome caverns.  The chemicals may also be transferred from the caverns to the storage tank and loaded onto tanker trucks to be transported"

The operating procedures are reviewed as needed or when a management of change occurs and are certified annually.  Safe work practices have also been developed as required in 40 CFR \u00a768.69(d).\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nEach new employee at Martin is trained according to his/her job role.  Those employees at MUS undergo initial awareness training and also specific training on procedures if involved in operating a process.  The employees are refreshed at least once every three years and their training is documented and kept on site for review.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nMartin owns a Mechanical Integrity group that conducts all of the mechanical integrity inspections for the Martin Facilities.  The process equipment described in 40 CFR \u00a768.73(a)(1)-(6) are inspected based on the written procedures developed by Martin or third party procedures (i.e. ASTM).  Any deficiencies found by the mechanical integrity group that are outside acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures have been developed to manage changes to operating procedures, process equipment, chemicals, technology, process safety information,; and, changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process.  The procedures ensure that the considerations found in 40 CFR \u00a768.75(b)(1)-(5) are addressed prior to any change.\r\n\r\nThose employees affected by the change are notified and trained on the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews will be conducted prior to any new stationary sources or any modified stationary sources, when those modifications are significant enough to require a change in the process safety information, are started.

Program 3 requires that MUS have the process safety information for the hazardous chemicals, conduct a process hazard analysis (PHA), create operating procedures, conduct training, implement a mechanical integrity program, implement a management of change program, conduct a pre-startup review, conduct compliance audits, conduct incident investigations, ensure employee participation, issue hot work permits, and include contractors in the release prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety information\r\n\r\nSafety Data Sheets (SDS) are maintained on site and online and are readily available to any employee for review.  The SDS contains all of the information required by 40 CFR \u00a768.65(b)(1)-(7).\r\n\r\nInformation pertaining to the technology of the process at MUS is contained in block flow diagrams (PFD) and Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID).  The chemistry of the substances stored, maximum inventory, safe upper and lower temperature, pressure, and flow limits, and the evaluation of the consequences of deviations are all maintained on site and are managed by the PSM Coordinator.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nA PHA was conducted and has been re-evaluated every 5 years.  The PHA was and is conducted by qualified staff which consists of corporate Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) staff and on site staff.  The methods utilized to complete the PHA have been what-if analyses and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  Other methodologies as allowed by 40 CFR \u00a768.67b(1)-(7) may be used in future updates of the PHA if applicable.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nOperating procedures are written by competent staff, such as facility managers or lead operators, which have experience on the pro"
