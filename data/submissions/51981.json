The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Ostrander Farmers' Coop (Ostrander Location) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\n- The primary acitvity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct soil application for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 220,000 pounds in our two (1-30,000 gal & 1-18,000) storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi tank car holding 44,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\na.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity releases would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of despension to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\n\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to  200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,      K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\n-  have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor\n\n\n\n-  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\n\n\n-  The facility has:\n\n\n\na.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CRF 1910.38.\n\n\n\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as require under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\n\n\n\nc.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CRF 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
