      "SummaryText": "The purpose of this document is to describe the process, and demonstrate and evidence that Advanced Green Innovations (\"AGI\") has: 1) conducted the necessary safety reviews and analysis of potential toxic, fire and explosion hazards related to its business operations; and; 2) implemented the operational safety procedures and safety programs required to comply with the requirements of PHA, RMP, PSM and HAZOP. \n\n\n\nBackground.\n\n    \n\nAssociated flare gas (\"AFG\"), or associated gas, is a form of natural gas found with deposits of petroleum, either dissolved in oil or as a free \"gas cap\" above the oil in the reservoir. AFG is often released as a waste product from the petroleum and/or natural gas extraction process and is combusted in gas flares due to the remote location of many gas fields or oil fields. \n\n\n\nThe quality, concentration and content of AFG from oil and gas wells varies significantly from field to field, and well to well. As a result, while highly energetic, AFG is not a consistent uniform fuel that can be used in standardized natural gas engines for power production (i.e., a genset).  However, AGI has developed a solution to this problem.\n\n\n\nAGI's Associated Gas Conditioning System (the \"AGI AGCS\") uses gas reforming technology to convert larger hydrocarbon molecules into methane. The solution developed by AGI is to modify the unit energy content of the raw AFG to a consistent fuel that can be used to operate standard off the shelf natural gas engine gensets. The AGI AGCS uses a process that reforms the heavier liquid fuels leaving lighter hydrocarbons that contain consistent mixture of methane and hydrogen.\n\n\n\nThe AGI AGCS Process Description.\n\n\n\nThe AGI AGCS consists of two major process units: (i) a common skid; and (ii) a process skid. \n\n\n\nThe common skid consists of a water supply system that provides steam to the unit, and a sulfur removal unit. The incoming gas stream requires the removal of sulfur and other toxic chemicals/compounds. The sulfur remova"

      "SummaryText": "l system filters impurities from the incoming AFG to protect the reactor catalyst from premature failure. The filter system has a pressure vessel and media to reduce incoming H2S below 1 ppm. In addition to the H2S removal, the filter system uses a polishing filtration bed to trap benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and other organic sulfides in the flare gas.\n\n\n\nThe process skid reforms AFG into methane. Components of the process skid include a superheater, heat exchangers, a heavy hydrocarbon reactor (\"HHR\"), a synthetic natural gas reactor (\"SNG\"), burner/blowers, mechanical and electronic controls. The process skid electronics control the components on the skid, which are monitored and controlled by the master control on the common skid.\n\n\n\nThe process skid receives dry steam at 140&#8304;C (about 285&#8304;F) from the boiler. The steam is piped to the superheater where it is metered and mixed with pretreated AFG and heated to 500&#8304;C (about 930&#8304;F). This steam/gas blend enters the HHR to reform the heavy hydrocarbon chains into a mixture of methane, methyl group molecules, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO). The gas mixture is cooled and then transferred to the SNG. The SNG completes the creation of methane molecules, along with small amounts carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Water is condensed from the SNG output gas, recovered, and returned for re-use in the process. \n\n\n\nThe output gas is then returned to the common skid, which removes any excess moisture from the output gas and controls the input gas and steam feed based upon output demands and methane content of the output gas.\n\n\n\nPeripheral to this process is an 18,000 gallon natural gas liquids (NGL) storage tank that will be used to store butane and propane which can be used to run through the system when it isn't experiencing a significant load. This avoids the need to turndown the unit. During initial testing, this tank will serve as the main feed for the unit. Prior to the development of the"

The process involves investigating how the AGI AGCS could potentially deviate from its design intent. The prime objective for the HAZOP study is problem identification. A process is divided into smaller subsystems called nodes, and then guide words are used to consider deviations from the design intent. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this HAZOP study was to provide an additional layer of safety review over systems in the AGI AGCS unit that contain materials that are flammable, high pressure, or high temperature. This study included a safety review of:  i) the pipes and components that contain, process, and dispose of the AFG; ii) the pipes and components that handle steam (from the boiler outlet); and iii) the pipes and components that handle pressurized nitrogen. \n\n\n\nThe AGI HAZOP team included a leader, scribe, and representatives from production and operations, electrical and instrumentation, process design, mechanical, and safety. The HAZOP process was divided into 20 nodes, and required over 200 man hours to complete. A total of 96 recommendations resulted from the HAZOP study. The nodes, guide words, findings, recommended actions, and date of completion are all available for review.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nIn addition to the HAZOP, the site has an emergency response plan.

Equipment that contain fluids that may freeze due to long term exposure to freezing temperatures should be moved to heated areas, drained of liquids, or provided with auxiliary heat sources.\n\n\n\nUpon Restoration of heat and power:\n\n?    Electronic equipment should be brought up to ambient temperatures before energizing to prevent condensate from forming on circuitry.\n\n?    Fire and potable water piping should be checked for leaks from freeze damage after the heat has been restored to the facility and water turned back on. \n\n \n\nCHEMICAL SPILL\n\n\n\nThe following are the locations of:\n\n\n\nSpill Containment and Security Equipment: for odorant or Diesel Fuel\n\n\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE):     Gas Sensors"
