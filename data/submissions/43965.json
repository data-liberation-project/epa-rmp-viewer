Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nVirginia KMP Corporation is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as process safety information, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Hydrofluoric Acid, 70% solution.  The maximum inventory of hydrofluoric acid at our facility is 1,650 pounds.  This material is handled in 550 pound polyethylene drums.  These drums are built and tested according to DOT 49CFR specifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, \r\nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario of hydrofluoric acid.  Virginia KMP Corp. has the following passive mitigation systems in place:  Enclosure, drain and sump.  We also have the following active mitigation systems in place:  Sprinkler system, and emergency shutoff.\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used EPA?s RMP*Comp.  The worse case scenario modeled the release of 550 pounds of hydrofluoric acid, 70% solution according to the duration and atmospheric estability parameters established by EPA.  The alternative case scenario modeled the release of HF"

The release rate was calculated considering a hole at the bottom of the drum and a liquid column of 32 inches.  The time of the release was considered 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nVirginia KMP, Corp. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process that involves the use of hydrofluoric acid.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nOur facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses was the Check list method recommended by the Chemical Manufacturers Association Warehouse Assessment Protocol.   The study was undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis were addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Virginia KMP maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nVirginia KMP, Corp. has a comprehensive training program in"

      "SummaryText": "place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nVirginia KMP, Corp. conducted an internal audit to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule were properly implemented.These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be taken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nVirginia KMP, Corp. promptly will investigate any incident or near miss that could result in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nVirginia KMP, Corp. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no reportable release during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nVirginia KMP, Corp, will notify the local emergency responders when there is need for a response.  We believe that the size of our operation does not allow development of a full-fledged emergency response plan.  We will focus on employee safety and adopt a policy as a non-responding facility.  Virginia KMP will provide all necessary information regarding quantities and characteristics of our regulated substances to the Dallas Fire Department to help plan the response to an emergency at its facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Reduction of chemical inventory is one of the most important steps have taken to improve safety at our facility.  This change was implemented on 06/14/1999."
