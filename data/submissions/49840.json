Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of AgVantage FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the DeWitt Fire Department,    \nClinton  Co. Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.      The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at, DeWitt  is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and \nhandling system consists of  a storage tank, loading risers associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be   230,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.      The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4.      The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR1910.111.  ?"

Historical information on this facility.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years , that to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, or shelter in place.  On April 19, 2006 we had a 400 lb release that we had to land farm some soil that was contaminated.\n\n6.      The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility has:\n\n-A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard,\n 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n             \n          In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify DeWitt Fire Department and  Clinton County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated                 \nwith both  the fire department and LEPC.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
