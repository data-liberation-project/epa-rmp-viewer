There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five year period or in the history of the plant.  \r\n\r\nAn RMP/PSM Compliance Manual was initially developed for the site in 2001, and is continually reviewed updated as needed or required by regulation. \r\n\r\nKey items included in the manual are:\r\n\r\n- Written site-specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews and Self-Audits;\r\n\r\n- Chlorine and process safety information as required by the regulations;\r\n\r\n- Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management; and\r\n\r\n- Chlorine system maintenance procedures.\r\n\r\nThe following additional steps were implemented to complete the prevention program:\r\n\r\n- Training on PSM/RMP and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\r\n\r\n- Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine process at least every 5 years; \r\n\r\n- Conducting a Compliance Audit at least every 3 years\r\n \r\n- Developing an Emergency Response Plan; and \r\n\r\n- Training in support of the certification of operators.\r\n          \r\nThe Suez Project Manager and select employees are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Process Safety Management and Risk Management, the organization has an active safety program. The SRWTF has an active Employee Safety Committee that is a joint management-employee committee.  The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\r\n\r\nAt the Wastewater Plant, t"

As mentioned earlier, there have been no reportable chlorine releases from the plant.
