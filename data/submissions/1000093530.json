      "SummaryText": "A.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n     The Occidental Permian Ltd North Hobbs Plant committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention safeguards and programs and emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public, and the protection of the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, North Hobbs Plant personnel have been trained on the emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\r\n\r\nB.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n     During our process, we recover natural gas liquids (NGL) and strip hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from the gas stream for pipeline sales.  This is a Program Level 1 process.  \r\n\r\nC.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n     North Hobbs Plant is a Program Level 1 and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.\r\n\r\nD.  Five  year Accident history\r\n     In our review of the North Hobbs Plant incident records for the past three months (total time we have had the NGL plant running), we have not experienced an accidental release from a covered process resulting in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nE.  Emergency response program\r\n     The North Hobbs Plant maintains a written emergency action plan to control and contain an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Th"

We will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing any North Hobbs Plant incidents.\r\n     2.  We will continue to develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities \r\n          between Oxy plants.\r\n     3.
