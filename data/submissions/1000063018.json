Through our ongoing implementation of the PSM and now, the RMP program, Deepwater Chemicals looks continuously for possible system changes to improve the environmental and safety aspects and impacts of our operations.\r\n\r\nDeepwater has been utilizing the use of chlorine at this facility since 1994 as both an oxidizing agent and in chlorinations in halogen chemistry, mainly in the manufacturing of inorganic and organic Iodine derivatives. Deepwater Chemicals, Inc. primary focus for these derivatives is to the oil & gas, pharmaceutical, photographic, coatings, weather modification, nylon, acetic acid, mercury control, animal feed, nutritional supplement industries as well as other specialty applications.

      "SummaryText": "910.119. As a result of a concerted effort by the management team, we are achieving new business opportunities and by the overall growth of the iodine industry that requires Deepwater Chemicals to submit our Risk Management Program to allow for greater flexibility in production demands by increasing the amount chlorine in 1 ton cylinders to be stored on-site which is deemed a process by definition under RMP.\r\n\r\nDeepwater Chemicals has not had a release of chlorine at the facility since the beginning of commercial production in 1994. The chlorine storage area and vaporizer unit has undergone significant changes in the last 10 years as part of the Kaizen program. Deepwater Chemicals has worked closely with it's chlorine supplier and the Chlorine Institute in these capital projects and with the vigorous Management of Change program, recent 5-Year HAZOP and Pre-Startup Safety Review, release prevention, safety interlocks, detection systems, emergency stops are just a few of the key improvements in the chlorine system that meet IST, Inherently Safety Technology.\r\n\r\nThe DWC Emergency Action and Response Plan has been a document that has seen consistent updates and revisions that not only reflect improvements from the enhanced training and experienced workforce, but the mock drills conducted and weaknesses or improvements identified and recommended by employees during safety committee meetings. Deepwater's relationship and membership with the Woodward County LEPC and other local industries, being involved with annual city-wide Full Scale Exercises has also contributed to a sound coordination with outside resources to work with improving an overall needed response in the event of an chemical incident or natural disaster."
