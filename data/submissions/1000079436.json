The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety programs include but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances. The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen. It is the goal of the company to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.   \r\n\r\nA Non-Responding Facility policy has been adopted; however, the Company recognizes the need to be prepared to safely deal with emergencies. A Hazardous Material Business Plan consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements has been developed and includes emergency procedures, requirements, and information necessary to notify public response agencies and technical resources; the Staff communicate to the Fire Department and evacuate (or shelter-in-place) if there is a release situation or fire. Managers and employees would also shepherd visitors (truck drivers receiving product or delivering product). By effectively det"

The WPS Oxnard-area regional office and shop are both within 200 yards of the site. WPS supports HAZWOPER 1910.120 (q) and Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians (RETA) training for key Refrigerating Technicians and management personnel. These personnel are available to support Oxnard Fire/CUPA and the facility in the event of an emergency, and staff are on-call 24/7/365. Written procedures that include ammonia specific emergency pre-planning have been developed within the WPS Thirty Minute Plan. Ammonia-specific emergency equipment is maintained at the WPS Service Shop and in WPS Refrigerating Technician's service vehicles. The company strives to execute its accidental release prevention & emergency response policies through appropriately skilled employees that are provided with adequate equipment and training. \r\n\r\nA relationship with Oxnard Fire/CUPA has been established. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated via regular site visits/inspections and submittal of appropriate EPCRA and other compliance reports. Compliance reports and submittals are updated in accordance with applicable requirements at predetermined intervals. Oxnard Fire/CUPA has also participated with WPS in the execution of Process Hazard Analysis at this and other facilities in the Oxnard area. The WPS/OBC facility has confirmed that it is included in the Oxnard Community Emergency Plan, and key management personnel have received training in the Incident Command System (ICS) training. \r\n\r\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nOcean Breeze Cooling is a facility located in Oxnard, CA in a"

Improvements over the years have been made according to codes in effect at the time. Ocean Breeze Cooling is 100% owned by WPS but operations are separated:  Ocean Breeze Cooling manages pre-cooling, refrigerated storage and shipping of fresh produce; WPS supervises and maintains the refrigeration system. \r\n\r\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables and fruit (primarily strawberries). The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site generally for four days from harvesting. The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods picking up in the month of October and finishing in July. The remaining months see little fresh product; however, the refrigeration equipment is still operative. Major maintenance is performed in the off-season. Operational maintenance is performed on a year-round basis. Company policy requires appropriately pre-qualified personnel to perform maintenance tasks. \r\n\r\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a single closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system. Refrigeration equipment consists of Portable Compressor/Condenser Units, Portable and Stationary Pressure Cooling Units, Portable Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Vessels, Pumps, Room Evaporators, piping and two Ammonia-water Diffusion Systems. Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure safety relief valves. The Ammonia-water Diffusion Systems protect Safety Relief Valves from venting directly to atmosphere. An automated refrigeration control, monitoring and alarm system automatically monitors the system.

The elements of the PSM Program are intended to be integrated with the ongoing functions of the facility. The program is specifically intended to prevent an occurrence and minimize the consequences of an Anhydrous Ammonia release. In California the PSM program is in accordance with CCR 8, 5189, which is integrated with the Cal/ARP and Fed/ARP Accidental Release Prevention Programs. \r\n\r\nWritten procedures have been developed for the daily operation of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release. The written procedures include necessary safety precautions and address each operating phase as defined by the Cal-ARP RMP/PSM Program. Refrigeration systems are only operated by pre-qualified personnel that are trained and qualified in the relevant operating and safety procedures. The Written Operating Procedures are maintained online & on-site and are regularly validated. \r\n\r\nScheduled inspections and maintenance are executed by Western Precooling Systems (WPS) qualified technicians and/or pre-qualified specialty vendors. WPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).

If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated. The facility has installed these types of valves at each of the system's oil drain points.   \r\n\r\nModifications have been made to provide support in the event of seismic activity. Relief valves have been piped to water absorbing tanks (dispersion/diffusion). Relief valve excursions were another unwanted release potential and by routing to a secondary containment system the effects of a relief situation have been mitigated.   \r\n\r\nOther Ammonia-Specific Release Prevention Steps: \r\n\r\n - Pressure relief valves are piped to a common header that terminates at the bottom of an Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank. \r\n\r\n - A computer monitoring system that monitors process parameters 24/7/365. This ammonia alarm system is continuously monitored via a third-party security company. \r\n\r\n - The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the facility from potential wrong-do-ers. \r\n\r\n - Per the PSM Program access to process areas is controlled by a sign-in/sign-out program  \r\n\r\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal's etc. Training is documented through an Online Training System (WBBM). \r\n\r\n - A good relationship exists with the Oxnard Fire Department.
