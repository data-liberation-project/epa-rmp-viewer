The following sections list each of the required executive summary data elements by rule citation.\n\nBackground\nWes Brown Treatment Plant which was formerly referred to as Columbine Water Treatment Plant use to chlorine for disinfection purposes.  This process was replaced by a sodium hypochlorite and UV system in 2004.  In 2004 the capacity of the plant was increased from 30 MGD to 50 MGD.  When the capacity increased the amount of aqueous ammonia stored on site increased to over the threshold quantity for the 40 CFR Part 68.  This revised RMP submittal reflects the changes that occurred since 2004, that is the removal of chlorine and the addition of aqueous ammonia.  \n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Wes Brown Plant is a 50-MGD municipal water treatment plant serving the communities of Thornton, Western Hills, Sherrelwood and Federal Heights.  The source of water for the plant is the East and West Gravel Lakes.  The plant treats the water from the lakes by clarification, filtration, and disinfection.  Sodium hypochlorite with ultra filtration is currently how the plant disinfects the water.  Aqueous ammonia is used for final finishing of the water in order to bind any free chlorine.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia used has a concentration of less than 30% ammonia and the storage amount is 9,000 gallons which equates to approximately 67,000 pounds.  The tank area is diked.    The aqueous ammonia tank area is secured to prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing the area.  The plant maintains an ammonia leak detection device.\n\n68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\nOne worst-case release scenario was assessed for the aqueous ammonia system.  This same scenario was also used for the alternative release scenario.  To calculate the release scenario the methodology in EPA?s Appendix F:  Supplemental Risk Management Program "

      "SummaryText": "Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The calculated distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.1 miles.  This distance becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process containing the regulated substance.  The residential population within the circle was determined to be 66 using 2004 Census Data.\n\n68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\nWes Brown Treatment Plant continuously evaluates and updates their safety and prevention procedures as needed.  The existing prevention program was reevaluated prior to the development of this revision to the Risk Management Plan.\n\n68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\nThe emergency response program established by the City of Thornton does not require personnel to act as the site incident commander.  In the case of an incident the City of Thornton Fire Department becomes is the incident commander and assumes the role direction response activities include any community emergency evacuation measures.  Fire rescue staff train at the Wes Brown facility on an annual basis.\n\n68.155(g) Safety Improvements\n\nIn response to the process hazard review, the plant will be documenting more of the testing of the training program.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe RMP*Submit satisfies the West Brown Water Treatment Plant?s requirement to register and provide the EPA a summary of their Risk Management Program for the aqueous ammonia system."
