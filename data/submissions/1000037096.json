We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the risk for all stakeholders.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to mitigate and prevent the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. We also coordinate with the Houston Ship Channel Area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe site will restart the Methanol unit which is part of the East/Mid Hydrocarbons process.  Anhydrous ammonia will be utilized for air pollution abatement and will be injected into the combustion exhaust stream of the reformer as part of a selective catalytic reduction process to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  Anhydrous ammonia will be stored in a pressurized tank in a quantity above the threshold, which prompts this change in the RMP submission.  As part of the overall review of the re-submission, the regulated substances and inventories were reviewed and modifications have been made accordingly.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility cracks Naphtha, OP-400, and condensates into a number of products that include Propylene, Butadiene, Isoprene, Isobutane and other olefins.

In addition to the investigation, action items resulting from the investigation are communicated site-wide and tracked to completion to prevent recurrence.  CVON has not experienced any accidental releases regulated under the RMP rule over the past 5-years.  An incident did occur in the East Plant in May, 2012 when there was a flammable mixture release when a valve body failed.  There were no consequences to the release; however the site requires investigation of incidents that could have resulted in catastrophic consequences.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to verify the provisions set forth under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.
