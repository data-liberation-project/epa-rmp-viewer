We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the risk for all stakeholders.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to mitigate and prevent the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. We also coordinate with the Houston Ship Channel Area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe site will restart the Methanol unit which is part of the East/Mid Hydrocarbons process.  Anhydrous ammonia will be utilized for air pollution abatement and will be injected into the combustion exhaust stream of the reformer as part of a selective catalytic reduction process to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  Anhydrous ammonia will be stored in a pressurized tank in a quantity above the threshold, which prompts this change in the RMP submission.  As part of the overall review of the re-submission, the regulated substances and inventories were reviewed and modifications have been made accordingly.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility cracks Naphtha, OP-400, and condensates into a number of products that include Propylene, Butadiene, Isoprene, Isobutane and other olefins.

Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified as a result of management of change activities or after completion of a process PHA. Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\n\n\nOperator Training / Qualification Program: A training and testing program is in place to ensure that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process. Operator re-qualification is required at a minimum of every three years.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Procedures: Specific procedures for maintaining process equipment are in place to ensure it operates safely. Plant and unit specific procedures for servicing operating equipment are in place, including preventive / predictive maintenance and reliability programs.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Training:  Mechanics and other craftsmen who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks are trained and tested on process equipment and inspections on operating equipment to ensure they have the required knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Program: Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are periodically tested and inspected to ensure safe operations, following recognized standards and governmental requirements.\n\n\n\nQuality Assurance: A system is in place to ensure that purchased equipment and materials meet established engineering standards and specifications.\n\n\n\nProcess Change Authorizations (Management of Change / PCAs): The site has a management system to ensure that modifications to a process or facilities are evaluated to ensure continued safe operations. Design (DSRs) and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) are conducted for facility or process changes prior to implementation of the change.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): Reviews are conducted just prior to startup to ensure that modified facilities or proces"

In addition to the investigation, action items resulting from the investigation are communicated site-wide and tracked to completion to prevent recurrence.  CVON has not experienced any accidental releases regulated under the RMP rule over the past 5-years.  An incident did occur in the East Plant in May, 2012 when there was a flammable mixture release when a valve body failed.  There were no consequences to the release; however the site requires investigation of incidents that could have resulted in catastrophic consequences.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to verify the provisions set forth under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented. These audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: The site has a written employee participation plan that defines how employees are consulted in the development and maintenance of the PSM/RMP elements.  Employees participate in PHA's and they have access to the PHA's and other process safety information.   Each operating and maintenance area has a representative on the Plant Safety Committee (EAGLES - Eliminating Accidents Guarantees Lasting Employee Safety) which supports occupational safety activities.  Contractors have a representative on this team.\n\n \n\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained, and uses the Houston Area Safety Council as a tool to provide the basic HSE training required of a contractor prior to entering a chemical manufacturing facility. All contractor employees must attend the Houston Area Safety Council training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant. In addition to basic training CVON site specific training is required prior to arriving at the plant.  The c"

This program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the site coordinates with the community response plan through the North Channel LEPC, as well as the Harris County Office of Emergency Management. The site is also a participating member of the Houston Ship Channel Area Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).  The site has a severe weather plan to prepare and recover from hurricanes, severe storms/tornadoes and flooding.\n\n\n\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of improvements planned to be implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n\n\n?    Continued review and upgrade of safety interlocks system.\n\n?    Revalidate all PHAs in accordance with requirements under RMP and PSM.\n\n?    Revise the emergency response plan after critiques from recent drills.\n\n?    Update facility security following the Security and Vulnerability Survey.\n\n?    Continue to utilize the tools of root cause analysis to investigate incidents and develop effective solutions to prevent recurrence.\n\n"
