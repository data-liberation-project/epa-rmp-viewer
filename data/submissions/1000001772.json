The Mallard Creek Polymers plant is an OSHA Star VPP Facility operating under OSHA Process Safety  Management (PSM) rules and regulations. The MCP site is also an ISO 9002/2000 registered business.\n\nThere have been no RQ releases in the past 5 years and no offsite impacts, onsite injuries nor property damage related to BD usage in the 30 year history at this facility. The plant conducts a PHA, Process Hazard Analysis every five years on the covered process or when changes occur or projects are implemented. Releases are prevented by sound engineering practices which include RAGAGEP, Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices, a rigorous computerized preventive maintenance and documented Mechanical Integrity program conducted by skilled, experienced and qualified personnel utilizing mandatory operating procedures. The OSHA Mechanical Integrity program includes detailed Vessel Integrity testing, frequent critical equipment checks and testing and complete system leak surveys to confirm and validate reliability. All equipment changes are formally reviewed and approved through a Management of Change process and before equipment is placed into service a formal pre-startup safety review is conducted by a qualified team. \n\nRoutine Inspections and audits of the plant safety programs are conducted both internally by the compliance and process engineering groups as well as external inspectors from the local Fire department hazardous materials group and Insurance company inspectors and OSHA. The plant also utilizes a formal documented Accident / Incident reporting system to include near misses. This process reviews all incidents to identify root cause issues for prevention and close-loop follow-up. \n\nThe plant is operated and manned on a 24 hour seven day schedule by formally trained \"Qualified Operators\". All operators are trained and tested to meet standardized knowledge, skill and ability req"

All plant visitors receive safety training / orientation and are escorted at all times. \n\nFormal, mandatory and documented, Emergency Response Policies and Procedures are in place to address accidental leaks and releases. The plan is designed to ensure that MCP responds effectively to emergency situations with the protection of the environment and personnel being the priority. The plant maintains and operates under an Emergency Response plan that includes an on duty Emergency Coordinator. The plan incorporates emergency response to all plant emergencies, with specific procedures for BD leaks or releases which includes, emergency responder coordination with Local Charlotte Fire departments and Hazmat responders as well emergency notification telephone contacts for police, governmental agencies and medical responders. \n \nResponse procedures are in place for emergency shutdown of vessels and equipment, activation of alarm systems, Halon Fire suppression systems, deluge and fire pump systems, emergency generator, and plant security. MSDS information, response equipment, site drawings and plot plans are readily available in the plan. Inspections and testing of response equipment is conducted and documented. Training and drills on response and plan elements are conducted. Personnel have been trained on fire response, hazardous materials handling and spill prevention control and countermeasures.
