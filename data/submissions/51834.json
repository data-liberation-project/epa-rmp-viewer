      "SummaryText": "This O\u00bfLakes facility in Kent, Ohio is operated as a creamery butter production facility.   The facility utilizes a single stage anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to maintain the proper temperature for production within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high pressure vessel, evaporators, compressors, scraped surface heat exchangers, piping and other refrigeration equipment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:   Land O\u00bfLakes is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.110 and EPA's Risk Management Program Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:  EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario.  The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst care release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention.  It is conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for the actual emergency response planning.\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  This endpoint is a concent"

Bases on Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, a release from the vessel would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario selected is one in which an ammonia line is ruptured.  EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's Risk Management Guidelines were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n1.   Must be more likely to occur that the worst case scenario, and\n2.   Must reach an endpoint off site, unless no such criteria exist.\n\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  Base on EPA's guidance the alternative release scenario would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  \nAs a part of the PSM program, Land O\u00bfLakes-Kent, Ohio plant has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  These programs include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre Startup Safety Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\nHot Work Permits\nContractor Safety\n\n\nEmergency Response Information:  As a part of the PSM Program, Land O\u00bfLakes maintains an Emergency Action Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to ensure employees are accounted for in the event of an evacuation.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, i"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no reportable accidental releases within in the past five years.  Should a release occur, procedures are in place to ensure that all incidents will be documented and analyzed to prevent future occurrences.            \n\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  These elements have been implemented into our operation of the system.\n\nIn addition, Land O\u00bfLakes will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program."
