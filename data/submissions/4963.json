We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbides Responsible Care. requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Union Carbide North Charleston Distribution Terminal is a storage and redistribution facility for chemicals manufactured at other locations.  The North Charleston Distribution Terminal is managed by the Union Carbide South Charleston Plant. It is treated as a separate stationary source because the Kanawha River separates it from the South Charleston Plant, therefore, it is considered noncontiguous with the South Charleston Plant.  The North Charleston Distribution Terminal stores and distributes chemical materials to the South Charleston Plant for processing.  One of these chemicals is vinyl acetate monomer, which is used in the manufacture of polyvinyl acetate. The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the North Charleston Distribution Terminal, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.  Union Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the North Charleston Distribution Terminal:\n\n7 Vinyl Acetate Monomer\n\nThere are no Union Carbide o"

The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The terminal's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\nRegulated Toxic Substances\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes catastrophic failure of a railroad tank car releasing 190,000 lbs of vinyl acetate monomer as a liquid to the atmosphere.  According to EPAs Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Pressure Relief Device:  This device is designed to relieve pressure at a predetermined set point and prevents over pressure of the railroad tank car.\n7 Collection Pan:  A collection pan can be used to contain small spills and direct material into process sewer to minimize evaporation to atmosphere.\n7 Operator Surveillance:  An operator is required to be present while unloading a vinyl acetate monomer railroad tank car.\n7 Foam Trailer:  Foam material can be sprayed across the surface of a vinyl acetate monomer spill to minimize evaporation to the atmosphere.\n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors: Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress vinyl acetate monomer vapors.\n\nAlternate-Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes a liquid release from a pump discharge line when pumping vinyl a"

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including:\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures \n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.\n\nThe South Charleston Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.   The plant emergency squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.   Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, Union Carbide staffs a Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team in the Kanawha Valley that responds to accidental releases from transportation equipment throughout the continental United States.  \n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
