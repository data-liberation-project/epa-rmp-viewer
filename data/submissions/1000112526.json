All relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient conditions.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Ocean Mist Farms personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nOcean Mist Farms facility is a Non-Responding facility. The facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to the RMP Program Coordinator. The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0*. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems catego"

A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix 12* of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4* for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOcean Mist Farms maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Chapter 16: Incident Investigation*.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the machinery room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the machinery room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. A"

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOcean Mist Farms conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to start-up and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOcean Mist Farms uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan.\nThe ammonia system is used for fresh produce cold storage, glycol chilling, ice generation, and vacuum cooling. There are six separate systems at the facility; one large system and five other smaller systems, which vary in age. The total charge for all the refrigeration systems is approximately 39,650 lb. The largest of these systems (Main Cooler) has a maximum ammonia charge of 20,000 lb. None of the other five systems have a charge greater than the 10,000 lb requirement for EPA RMP compliance.\n\nTh"
