The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc. - Kenosha facility is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of Roundy's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, Roundy's  is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Roundy's Kenosha facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is"

The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm.  The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc. - Kenosha facility building.

      "SummaryText": "ands and changes.\n\n\n\n5.  The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable ammonia releases at the facility since the facility opened or in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\n6.  The emergency response program\n\n \n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc. has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc.  conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan.  The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nRoundy's Supermarkets, Inc. is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits.  The flexibility of the program allows Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc. to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of Roundy's employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n01/08/2021 - several attempts have been made to perform a new compliance audit; however, plant personnel exposure to COVID canceled these to date.  The audit will be attempted as soon as practical and anticipated in February 2021."
