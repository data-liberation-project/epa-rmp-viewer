Facility Policy\n\n\n\n      The owner, management and employees of Sur-Gro Plant Food Co. Inc.-Forest City are committed to the\n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility \n\nis prepared to work with the local fire department, Holt County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and\n\nminimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.   Facility Information.\n\n\n\n      The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product, anhydrous\n\nammonia is received, stored and distributed for the dircet application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous\n\nammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\n\n\n       An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental\n\nreleases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n       The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n\n(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and ANSI K61.1-1999 covering\n\nanhydrous ammonia. The OSHA and ANSI standards are referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section\n\n8.3 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n      \n\n       There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries,evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n \n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\n       The facility has:\n\n\n\n       a. A written emerge"

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required responce action is to\n\nevacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency responce numbers listed in ou Emergency\n\nAction Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n       Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the\n\nconditions of the facility. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of\n\nanhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
