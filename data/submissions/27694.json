Sulfur Dioxide for the dechlorination of the City's wastewater effluent is stored at this location.  On average, 10,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide are stored in one ton cylinders.  In case of a sulfur dioxide leak, the City of Alexandria has an emergency response policy which requires City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 center.  Local fire and police departments are notified.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in evaluating citizens in the affected area.  \n\nThe worst case incident used EPA's RMP Comp(TM) model which projected the release of 2000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in ten minutes.  The affected area, 1.3 miles, included approximately 9652 citizens. Public facilities such as hospital, prison, and major commerical areas are located in the potential affected area.  The alternative release model used EMP's RMP Guidance for WasteWater Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equation.  The model was based on 99 pounds/minute release affecting an area, 0.2 miles, withapproximately 300 citizens potentially affected.   Currently, the City uses daily inspections and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is operating properly.  There are  active, emergency shutdown systems, and passive mitigation, enclosures,  being used at the facility at the present time.\n\nPlant personnel have been properly trained to handle sulfur dioxide stored in one ton cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination system.\n\nThe City of Alexandria has no history of reportable release for sulfur dioxide at this site.  There has been no injury or property loss associated with this chemical. \n\nThe City of Alexandria Wastewater Treatment Plant Dechlorination System at Third Street is included in witten community emergency re"
