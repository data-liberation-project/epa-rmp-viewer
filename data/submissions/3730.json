Louisville Works, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We adhere to corporate policies, which can be summarized as \"All safety and environmental incidents can be prevented\".  In addition to this emphasis on preventing accidental releases, we are prepared to respond to any emergency situation that may occur.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and the use of substances covered by this regulation\n- A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental  chemical releases\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals covered by this regulation\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of planned improvements at our facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, or the environment\n- The certifications this regulation requires us to provide\n- The detailed data elements about our risk management program\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe DuPont Fluoroproducts site is located along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky just southwest of the city of Louisville in an area known locally as \"Rubbertown\".  We operate two processes using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  One process produces HCFC-22 with HFC-23 and hydrogen chloride as by-products.  The second process produces HFC-152a (1,1 difluoroethane) and vinyl fluoride.  Each process uses fluorine based technology and operates independently.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst Case Scenario  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the toxic chemicals on our site is the rupture of an anhydrous hydrogen fluoride railcar, releasing the entire contents instantaneously with no mitigation assumed.  According to EPA's OCA Guidance for worst case scenarios, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on other industry, residential populations, and public receptors.  Rupture of a railcar is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design, including full head shields.   \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nBoron trifluoride -- A 3/8\" pipe on a storage cylinder is sheared, r"

Using EPA's OCA Guidance for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would have an off-site impact on other industry,  residential populations, and public receptors.\n \nChlorine -- A 1/8\" hole develops in a liquid chlorine pipeline.  The leak is assumed to continue for 60 minutes with no mitigation.  Using EPA's OCA Guidance for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would have off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations or other receptors.\n\nChloroform -- A 1/2\" hole develops at the base of a storage tank releasing chloroform into a concrete dike.  The leak is assumed to continue for 15 hours until the remaining contents of the tank can be pumped to another vessel.  Using EPA's OCA Guidance for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would have off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations or other receptors.  \n\nHydrogen fluoride -- A 2\" valve on a pipe fails in the open position releasing hydrogen fluoride.  The hydrogen fluoride is detected by sensors, which activate alarms that prompt operators to remotely isolate the leak and activate water sprays within 3 minutes.  The pooled hydrogen fluoride is assumed to continue to evaporate for an additional 9 minutes.  Using EPA's OCA Guidance for alternative scenarios, this toxic gas release would have off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations or other receptors.\n\nWorst Case Scenario  Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the flammable chemicals involves the rupture of a 1,1 difluoroethane storage sphere, releasing the entire contents instantaneously with no mitigation assumed. This release, if ignited,  would have an offsite impact on other industry and residential populations as determined by the use of EPA's OCA Guidance.  Rupture of the sphere is very unlikely due to the high-integrity design and maintenance of the sphere.  Additionally, ig"

Using \"TRACE\" modeling techniques, this release has an off-site industrial impact, but no impact on residential populations.  \n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe accident prevention programs in place are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. \n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following prevention steps:\n\n- Maintain up to date technical standards\n- System designs meet or exceed industry standard\n- Processes are controlled by computer and include alarms and interlocks to maintain safe operation \n- Materials installed pass Quality Assurance inspection\n- Perform Process Hazard Analyses on new and installed systems\n- Changes to technology or facilities are reviewed and authorized prior to implementation\n- All new or modified processes are started up under test authorization\n- All new or modified processes have prestartup safety inspections performed\n- Critical process equipment is inspected regularly for mechanical integrity\n- Operators are trained on processes prior to startup\n- Operators and mechanics have individual training plans for attaining and maintaining qualification\n- Personnel turnover is controlled to maintain adequate experience and knowledge for a safe operation\n- Detailed procedures cover operations, maintenance, and safe work practices\n- Contractors are trained and qualified\n- Hazards are controlled by a work order and work permit system\n- Safety inspections are regularly conducted by site and corporate personnel\n- All incidents are investigated and corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence\n- Employe"

These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases and help achieve that goal.\n\n5.0 Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all chemical releases that occur at our facility.  In the past 5 years, we have had one accidental release of an EPA RMP covered material that involved onsite or offsite impact, as defined by the EPA RMP rule mandated by the CAA section 112(r).\n\nOn 5/19/97, a release occurred from the 1,1 difluoroethane reactor/tar system. A total of 11,500 pounds of hydrogen fluoride was released over a 40 minute period. The immediate area was evacuated and neighboring downwind plants were contacted.  Employees at several of these plants evacuated.  Nine DuPont employees and contractors given precautionary treatment for hydrogen fluoride exposure.  None of the exposures resulted in recordable injuries.  One offsite business notified DuPont that one of their employees reported exposure and received first-aid treatment.\n\nWe conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the key factors that caused the release.  It is our philosophy and practice that all accidental releases, regardless of size and significance, are thoroughly investigated.\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nIn order to promptly respond to emergencies, it is essential to detect such situations quickly.  In addition to regular patrols and process monitoring by trained operating personnel, we employ remote sensors for chlorine and hydrogen fluoride and closed-circuit television monitori"
