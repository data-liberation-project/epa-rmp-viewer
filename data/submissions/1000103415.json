The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release, including first aid and medical treatment for exposures; evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation; notification of local emergency response agencies; and notification of the public if a release occurs.\n\nTexon has around-the-clock communications capability, including deployment of emergency response personnel and equipment with appropriate emergency response organizations (fire department, police, sheriff's office, or similar). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick responses to an incident. In addition, Texon conducts regularly scheduled emergency drills and annual refresher training for facility personnel.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTexon's management is committed to the following:\n\u2022\tPreventing accidents\n\u2022\tTraining employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident\n\u2022\tParticipating in community emergency preparedness training\n\u2022\tAddre"

The ultimate resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least five years.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nAccording to 40 CFR \u00a768.79(a), Texon is required to conduct an audit every 3 years of the covered procedure to assess compliance with the requirements of the prevention program. The audit must involve at least one individual who is knowledgeable about the process. Good engineering practices are conducted by Texon employees and management, or a qualified third-party, if appropriate. This audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are concluded. The ultimate resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTexon's accident release prevention and response policies are applied to the entire RMP-covered process through universal prevention activities, including but not limited to: elimination of sources of ignition, absence of secondary containment or drains for liquid releases, avoidance of congested areas, and atmosphere control. Collectively, these prevention program activities help avoid potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nFacility-specific detection and equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the facility to:\n\u2022\tContain/monitor a release\n\u2022\tQuickly detect a release"

Examinations and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended, and that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate welfare concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. The management team reviews the use of the equipment and determines what further action is necessary.\n\nAn integral part of the integrity program is quality assurance. Texon incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps to determine that new equipment is applicable for its intended use and that the proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nTexon has standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, industrial standards, and good engineering practices in place to help provide employee, public, and process safety.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nTexon has a comprehensive system to manage changes to facility processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Each proposed change must be reviewed to:\n\u2022\tDetermine that adequate equipment is in place to manage new hazards \n\u2022\tVerify that existing equipment has not been compromised by the proposed change\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.

Facility personnel also monitor contractor performance concerning their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nTexon conducts a PSSR for new facility modifications that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for a startup before placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in compliance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as quality assurance verification that the accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nTexon has established practices and procedures for the secure operation of fixed, rotating, and emergency shutdown equipment.

Operating procedures are revised, as necessary, by employee suggestions, compliance audits, PHAs, good engineering practice, and pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR), to maintain completeness and accuracy. Revisions are implemented through Texon management.\n\nProcess operating procedures are readily available for personnel to use, as necessary, to safely perform their job tasks and maintain the process unit operations within the defined limits.\n\nTraining\n\nTexon has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating covered processes at the facility. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review must be concluded during this training interval. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks safely on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, operators continuously receive subsequent training on the operating procedures to refresh their skills and knowledge to an acceptable level.

      "SummaryText": "Accident Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nTexon LP (Texon) owns and operates the Howard Station storage facility (facility) in Howard County, Texas. The facility is designed to receive and store butane for delivery to end markets.\n\nTexon has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of Texon facilities. Texon policy is to implement reasonable jurisdictions to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility-trained personnel plan to evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nButanes are unloaded from trucks into two (2) 90,000 gallons butane storage bullet tanks prior to injection into a nearby pipeline prior to sales. The two butane storage bullet tanks and connected pipelines are considered a single process that has two or more connected vessels of the same regulated substance that could be involved in a potential release at the facility. Regulated flammable substances (listed in the 40 CFR \u00a768.130) used at the facility are i-Butane, n-Butane, i-Pentane, and n-Pentane. Since there are different flammable substances in a single process, this is defined as a flammable mixture. The RMP rule only applies to flammable mixtures if the amount of a regulated substance in the mixture is greater than 1 percent (1%) and the mixture as a whole meets the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA-4) requirements of \u201cmaterials that vaporize quickly or completely when subjected to normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, are easily dispersed in the air, and burn easily\u201d. Typically, this degree includes materials that will spontaneously ignite when exposed to air, flammable ga"
