The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, refinery evacuation plans and accounting for refinery personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, SPPR has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Team conducts additional training sessions so that they can safely handle potential emergency situations. The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for SPPR is coordinated with the facility's Emergency Response Team (ERT), WAKOTA CAER, a local emergency response cooperative, and with offsite response agencies that would be requested to support emergency response efforts as needed. This coordination includes periodic meetings which include local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\r\n\r\nThe refinery has installed Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) on all process heaters and boilers to reduce fire, explosion, toxic gas releases or spills through adoption of design standards that represent industry best practices. These systems provide interlock systems which monitor critical operating conditions (fuel pressure, temperature, flow, etc.) during heater startup and during normal operations. Deviations from normal ranges for these conditions will prevent startup or will initiate a controlled shutdown.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, SPPR has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n- Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage and other areas;\r\n- Hy"

These procedures and safe work permit system, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to enable operations and maintenance activities to be performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nSPPR has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the\r\nchange. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nSPPR promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to SPPR management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the"

In addition, SPPR evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor and conducts annual audits of each contractor's safety program to ensure that the relevant requirements are being met. Additionally, SPPR personnel periodically monitor or audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nSPPR conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new equipment or equipment modification that require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional means to verify that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready.

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, SPPR has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees must receive basic training in SPPR operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operating employees periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an\r\nacceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution. Approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios for flammables and toxics as defined by the USEPA. A worst-case release scenario event is unlikely to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like SPPR. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help local emergency responders, such as fire and police departments and the county and state emergency managers, to improve local emergency response planning. Release scenario analyses have been submitted to USEPA and have shared that information with the organizations involved in emergency response activities. It should be noted that no events in the magnitude of these worst-case or alternative incident scenarios have ever occurred at the facility. In the case of some of these incident scenarios, emergency mitigation systems would reduce the consequences of the events should they occur. In all cases, should such events occur, the emergency response plan would be implemented, local authorities would be notified, and appropriate actions would be taken to protect both employees and the public.\r\n\r\nAs stated previously, details regarding these scenarios have been provided in"
