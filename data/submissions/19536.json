      "SummaryText": "The Trinidad Plant was originally constructed as part of a gas processing plant and, as such, was constructed using equipment and construction procedures and materials which met all applicable industry codes and our policy is to adhere to all federal, state and local laws.  The gas processing equipment was removed from the plant site several years ago.  Operating personnel (part-time) are thoroughly trained in process safety management at a company-operated gas processing plant.\n\nThis facility now serves as a trans-shipment point for commercial propane and is utilized less than 5% of the time.  The plant has a 30,000 and an 18,000 gallon propane tank, two (2) dry desiccant treating vessels, valves, pumps and interconnecting piping.  All propane received and shipped from the facility is by tanker trucks.  This plant has not had a release of chemicals that caused any on-site or known off-site consequences during the past five years.  The facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the failure of the 30,000 gallon propane tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the EPA stipulated 1 psi over pressure zone.  There are no toxics stored at this location.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, our policy is to notify the Henderson County Sheriff's Department and the Trinidad Fire Department and request their assistance with the emergency.  Except as arranged by company personnel, we would ask that their personnel or others not enter the area within the distance of the specified end-point since this could pose a danger to such persons."
