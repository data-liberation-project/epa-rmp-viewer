The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in these systems exceeds the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and the IS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold reporting quantities.\n\nFoster Farms is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  Our accidental release prevention policies are designed to comply with the PSM and RMP regulations. These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policies are designed to comply with all governmental emergency response regulations.\n\nFoster Farms accidental release prevention programs are based on the following key elements:\n+Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration mechanics and operators\n+Preventive maintenance (Mechanical Integrity) program\n+Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration mechanics and operators (Employee Participation Program)\n+Performance of a process hazard analysis of the refrigeration systems including equipment and piping\n+Implementation of an auditing and inspection (Compliance Audit) program\n+Procedures for handling all changes to the refrigeration systems (Management of Change)\n+Pre-Startup review procedures for significant refrigeration system modifications\n+Regular reviews and updates of process safety information\n+Procedures for investigating ammonia related release incidents and near-misses (Incident Investigation Program)\n+On site HazMat team\n+Emergency Response and Action Plan\n+Hot-work permit progr"

      "SummaryText": "am and procedures\n+Line Break procedures\n+Contractor Safety program\n\nFoster Farms follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventive maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying our employees, contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the ammonia refrigeration systems, as required under the regulations.  Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include the availability of air purifying respirators, self contained breathing apparatuses, air monitoring (ammonia and oxygen) devices, for the refrigeration mechanics and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIn accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, Foster Farms performs periodic audits and hazards reviews to enhance continued safe performance. Recommended actions to improve safety are identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for completion as required. For this RMP submission, a new offsite consequence analysis was not performed.  The ?worst case release? and ?alternative release scenarios? performed by Pilgrim?s Pride earlier this year were used."
