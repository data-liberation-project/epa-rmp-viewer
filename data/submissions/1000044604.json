All our milk comes from California dairy farms.\n\n\n\nAlta-Dena Certified Dairy uses a regulated substance (Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant in the refrigeration system) in order to cool the milk during processing and to maintain the milk at a cold temperature while being handled in the milk coolers.  Anhydrous ammonia is an environmentally friendly and efficient chemical to use for refrigeration.  The anhydrous ammonia is contained within a closed-loop refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM),\n\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and\n\n3)  OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site employees.

The Management of Change procedures are to ensures that process modifications are based on sound design principles and implemented in a safe manner.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review procedure is utilized as a check prior to ammonia being introduced into new equipment to be assured that the Management of Change procedures are completed.  A Hot Work Permit program ensures that Hot Work procedures are followed if Alta-Dena Certified Dairy employees or contractors are to perform hot work.  Contractors safety programs and records are evaluated.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere were no accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system during the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLANS\n\n\n\nThe facility would utilized the Los Angeles County Fire Department as an Emergency Responder."
