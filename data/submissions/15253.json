      "SummaryText": "In response to the chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68), the Village of Royal Palm Beach Utilities Department has prepared the following risk management plan. The Village owns and operates both water and wastewater treatment facilities. The water treatment facility, located at 10930 Okeechobee Blvd, consist of two lime softening plants and one membrane plant, with a total design flow of 5.0 MGD. The 40 CFR 68.130 regulated substances identified at the wastewater facility include chlorine (disinfectant), anhydrous ammonia, and propane and diesel fuel. With the exception of chlorine, the on-site quantities for these chemical substances are less than the threshold quantity identified under 40 CFR 68.130.\n\nThe Village of Royal Palm Beach Utilities Department recognizes the risks and dangers of working with toxic chemicals common to the water treatment industry.  As such, the Village places the health and safety of its employees and the surrounding public, and the protection of the environment as a top priority.  In complying with this policy, the water treatment facility will be setting-up a pilot study to consider sodium hyperchlorite as an alternative disinfectant.  The pilot study will commence in FY 2000.  In the interim, the Village adheres to a strict policy of administering safety management procedures.  It also provides continuous training of employees that handle, or work in close proximity to the toxic chemicals located at its facilities.  The procedures and training address both the prevention of accidental chemical releases and the protocol for responding to potential emergency situations.\n\nThe Utilities Department has instituted procedures for accidental release prevention.  The topics addressed include handling of chlorine cylinders during physical transfer at the site, location and atmosphere conducive to proper storage of chlorine cylinders, placement of chlorine cylinders into service, and removal of chlorine"

      "SummaryText": "cylinders from service.  The operators at the facility, most of whom are Florida State Certified Operators, have several years of experience safely handling chlorine.  They receive updated training regarding operations and safety on a regular basis. To prepare for an emergency at the water treatment facility, the operators have been trained in the following: Respiratory Protection, Emergency Action and Fire Protection.  The facility is also equipped with emergency leak kits and personal protective equipment to support addressing emergency releases. The operators are also trained to repair equipment, valve and piping leaks, and container leaks that may occur while in transit, storage, or in service.\n\nThe Utilities Department estimates, in accordance with the assumptions established under 40 CFR 68, that a 1.3 mile radius extending from the facility may potentially be impacted with the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine within a 10 minute period (worst case scenario).  In a more realistic estimate for the release of approximately 740 pounds of chlorine over a 20 minute period (alternative release scenario), it is estimated that 0.1-mile radius extending from the facility may potentially be impacted. The Utilities Department has instituted an emergency response program with the Palm Beach County Fire Department (PBCFD) in the event of either scenario.  The program has detailed procedures addressing communication with the PBCFD, and protocol for evacuating potentially impacted areas.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the water treatment facility over the past five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, or damage to property or the environment."
