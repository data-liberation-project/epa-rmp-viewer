      "SummaryText": "dance Reference Tables, an evaluation of a worst case and alternative case release was performed.  The worst case release evaluated would occur if the entire contents of a full storage tank were release during atmospheric conditions conducive to producing minimum dilution and maximum dispersion.  Although the potential for a release of this type to occur during these atmospheric conditions is very rare, the evaluation determined that the release could potentially impact both public and environmental receptors nearby.  Public receptors include recreation areas, commercial and public areas, prisons, schools, and residences.  Potential environmental receptors could include local monuments in Lawrenceburg.  \n\nThe alternative case release scenario evaluated was the same as the worst case release scenario, but it considered more realistic atmospheric conditions would be present if a release from the storage tank occurred.    As with the worst case, the potential for this type of release to occur is very rare.  Compared to the worst case release, the alternative case would allow for the release to be diluted more rapidly and as a result have the potential to impact a smaller area could only possibly include a lesser amount of recreation areas, commercial and public areas, prisons, schools, and residences.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the combination of training, frequent inspections, and an established emergency action plan has produced a system that has had no accidental releases.  In addition the plant adheres to the Process Safety Management requirements set forth by OSHA for the anhydrous ammonia system which adds additional safety and awareness to the system."
