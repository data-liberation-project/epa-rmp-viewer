The purpose of Saputo's Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency in order to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. All employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate - Department of Environmental Affairs, Health & Safety and Risk Group will improve compliance and overall plant safety."

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the Fond du Lac LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nFACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses cheese and whey manufacturing. The plant is located at N3545 CR-EE, Waupun, WI 53963. The facility employs approximately 400 employees. There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used in the Main Plant refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for production and warehousing. This system contains 18,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Saputo - Waupun plant follows the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management program as a release prevention program for RMP. In addition, Saputo Corporate - Department of Environmental Affairs works with the plant confirming regulatory and corporate standards are being followed, providing guidance and standardization on the RMP and OSHA PSM programs and acting as a resource for the plant on the RMP, PSM and other environmental programs.\r\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nSaputo has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years"
