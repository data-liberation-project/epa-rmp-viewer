This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant located in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. (formally known as Tejas Gas Processing, L.L.C.) and is operated by Enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of two processing plants, Toca I and Toca II.  Toca I is a refrigerated lean oil absorption plant while Toca II is a cryogenic plant.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility via pipeline.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.\n\n\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nListed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Toca Gas Plant are rich oil, mixed NGL product, propane, and process and fuel gases.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified as a Program Level 1"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Toca Gas Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is "

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the facility will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that mus"

The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Toca Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.
