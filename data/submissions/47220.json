              "Description": "This prevention program applies to a single chlorine gas storage and supply unit. Design and construction of the original unit was accomplished by outside firms in 1985. All applicable building and equipment codes were adhered to. Updates incorporating new safety features were designed and constructed in 2006. Employees were trained in the use of new systems. Standard Operating Procedures exist for operating the process. Maintenance is handled by trained maintenance personnel. To increase safety, the chemical building has been enclosed, the chlorine gas feed system has been converted from a pressure/vacuum system to  a virtually complete vacuum system, and a scrubber installed which will handle the release from one full container. Alarm systems are built in and response procedures to system leaks defined.",

      "SummaryText": "The City of Odessa operates a water treament palnt located at 811 W. 42nd Street in Odessa, Ector County, Texas. As part of the treatment process, the water is disinfected using chloramines. Chloramines are formed when chlorine is combined with an ammonia source. Historically, the city stored and used chlorine gas and anhydrous ammonia as an ammonia source for the process. The City of Odessa submitted its original RMP based on the storage of these two chemicals on June 17, 1999 and again on June 17, 2004. Changes to the disinfection system at the water treatment plant have prompted the current re-submittal of the facility. These changes include the enclosure of the structure housing the chemical storage and feeding systems, conversion of the partial pressure/partial vacuum feed system to a virtually all vacuum system, addition of a chlorine scrubber designed to neutralize the contents of a single one-ton (2,000 lb) container of chlorine gas released into the storagearea,and the increase of maximum chlorine storage from 28,000 lbs to 32,000 lbs. The use of anhydrous ammonia has been discontinued and replaced with a low-hazard chemical, liquid ammonium sulfate. The overall effect of these changes is one of greatly improved safety and total reduction in hazardous chemicals stored at this facility. This submittal reflects these two changes in chemical inventories and includes only chlorine gas.\n\nDue to the ongoing prescence of chlorine gas at this facility, the City of Odessa has developed a program to ensure the safe handling of this chemical. This safety program has been reviewed in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program and revised to comply with its provisions and enhance the existing program. The City of Odessa is committed to allocating the manpower and financial resources required to implement all facets of the Risk Management Program and thereby reduce the potential for an accidental release chlorine.\n\nThe off-site conseque"

      "SummaryText": "nce analysis has been revised by the independent consulting firm of Alan Plummer & Associates to incorporate the recent changes to the system using the air dispersion model \"ALOHA\". The analysis defines the area potentially affected by the release of chlorine gas allowing the identification of residential populations, public and environmental receptors, industrial and commercial sites, and natural sites such as parks. The results of those revisions have been incorporated into this submittal. To summarize, three scenarios were run and included in this submission; the first was the required worst-case which showed no change from the 2004 submission. Two alternate scenarios were run taking into account above-mentioned improvements to the process, (1) a scrubber and (2) the building enclosure. Alternative Release scenario ID_1 used the scrubber as a passive mitigation device. In this scenario the LOC for the chlorine gas did not reach outside the building. Inputs into the quantity released, release rate, and distance to end-point reflect the minimum values allowed for these entry cells. Alternate no. 2 uses the building enclosure as a passive mitigation device without benefit of the scrubber and shows an off-site end point of 0.60 mi.\n\nAs a part of the City's Risk Management Plan, the City reviewed the most recent five-year period to determine if any accidental releases or incidences which could have resulted in a reportable accidental release had occurred. No incidents were identified.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program for the City of Odessa contains several facets. The chemical storage areas were designed in accordance with the Standard Building, Mechanical, and Gas Codes, as well as the National Electrical Code. The established maintenance program ensures that the equipment is maintained in a manner which allows its safe operation. Standard Operating Procedures have been developed for the delivery of chlorine gas, operation of the chlorine feed system, manag"

Training programs have been implemented to ensure that employees have initial and ongoing training in the operation and maintenance of the chlorine gas system and proper response to an accidental release. This training not only includes plant personnel but also other personnel (e.g. Fire Department and contractors) who are instrumental to the overall success of the safety and emergency response programs. To ensure continued compliance with the conditions of the prevention program, periodic compliance audits are conducted and deficiencies addressed.\n\nAn emergency response plan is also in place. Trained plant personnel will address minor leaks while the Emergency Response Team of the Fire Department will address major leaks.  Leak detectors are in place that will alert plant personnel and Public Emergency Communications of a leak. Emergency Communications personnel will dispatch the Fire Department and notify key personnel. A simulated release and response is practiced annually with emergency response personnel. If needed, the public in the affected area can be alerted through the Dialogic Communicator Corporation (DCC) or similar system. The Emergency Plan has also been coordinated with the Ector County Local Emergency Planning Group Public Communication.\n\nThe City conducts periodic evaluations of its hazardous gas systems. We ensure that the leak detenction system is maintained, ongoing training is provided, and Standard Operating Procedures reviewed and updated as needed. In summary, the City of Odessa has implemented a Risk Management Plan as defined by the Envionmental Protection Agency to address a potential release from its chlorine system operated at the Water Treatment Plant. The complete report is on file a the City of Odessa Utilities Department."
