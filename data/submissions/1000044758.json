Pilot Chemical holds to the ChemStewards environmental, health, safety and security principles as developed by the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA).  Pilot Chemical is also committed to the maintenance of a quality management system which meets the requirements of the International Standards Organization ISO 9001:2008.  This commitment requires the work force to focus on the production of a quality product through continuous improvement in all phases of its operations.\r\n\r\nThe Pilot Chemical Company of Ohio, Middletown Plant occupies 27 acres in an open, relatively flat, combination rural and industrial area, southwest of Middletown, Ohio.  The original facility was constructed in 1984 with building additions in 1995 and 2012 and process additions in 1995 and 1998. The facility produces detergent grade sulfonic acid, synthetic detergents, surfactants and emulsifiers through continuous sulf(on)ation and neutralizer systems for use in the industrial, agricultural and personal care markets.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substances on site exceeding threshold quantities are Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, both of which are toxics, and Isopropylamine and Ethanol, both of which are flammable liquids.\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide is a clear, water-white liquid at temperatures below its atmospheric-pressure boiling point of\r\n14 deg. F.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored on site as a liquefied, compressed gas at a pressure near 100 psi.  Sulfur\r\nDioxide vapors are colorless and heavier than air, but are extremely irritating and suffocating at concentrations above 30 ppm. With a distinctive rotten egg smell, Sulfur Dioxide has good warning properties with an odor threshold of 0.5 ppm.  Sulfur Dioxide is stable and non-flammable in either the gaseous or liquid state.\r\n\r\nSulfur Trioxide is a clear, colorless, oily liquid at temperatures between its freezing and boili"

Sulfur Trioxide fumes react with the moisture in the air to form a dense, white cloud of Sulfuric Acid mist.  This mist is extremely irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory system.\r\n\r\nIsopropylamine is a colorless, water-white, highly flammable liquid with a strong ammonia-like odor.  Isopropylamine evaporates readily evolving vapor that is heavier than air and easily ignited.  Isoproplyamine\r\nis completely soluble in water and will not ignite at a concentration below 25%.\r\n\r\nEthanol is a clear, colorless liquid with an invisible vapor and strong, sweet, alcohol-like odor.  Ethanol is completely miscible in water.  Ethanol has a flash point of 54\u00b0F and is considered a Class IB flammable liquid by OSHA and NFPA.  With a lower flammability limit of 3.3%, releases of Ethanol are potential fire hazards.  Ethanol is normally stable, but reacts violently with strong oxidizing agents.\r\n\r\nIndustries and residences are at least 600 feet from the main building containing the sulfonation processes and from the Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide storage tanks.  The Isopropylamine and Ethanol storage tanks are 400 feet from the nearest industrial area and residence and 200 feet from the process building.\r\n\r\nThis facility has in place an accidental release prevention program that complies with all of the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  In addition:\r\n  &#9642;\tSensitive Sulfur Dioxide and flammable vapor detection systems are installed with monitors located in strategic locations throughout the processing areas to alert plant personnel of leaks.\r\n  &#9642;\tThe facility undergoes annual safety inspections by the Middletown Fire Department and our insurance company.\r\n  &#9642;\tBefore beginning any maintenance operation involving hot work, a Hot Work permit must be completed and signed by"
