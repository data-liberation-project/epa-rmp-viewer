Dodge, Iowa\n\n\n\nFarmland Industries, Inc. operates a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility at Ft. Dodge, Iowa.  As a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility, producing anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products utilizing ammonia as a feed stock, this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe amended Risk Managment Plan which this summary is part of, contains one major mitigation measure which has altered the worst case scenario.  The facility has installed dikes around each of the ammonia tanks.  Modelling of the worst case scenario has indicated a substantial reduction in distance to endpoint, and a reduction in affected populations.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the risk management plan, which includes hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Farmland Industries, Inc., Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant at Ft. Dodge, Iowa.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Fort Dodge Nitrogen Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility consisting of a large scale, natural gas feed ammonia production unit and an integrated urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) production unit.  These products are primarily used as agricultural fertilizers.\n\nInitial operation of the ammonia plant began in 1967. In 1997, the UAN unit was completed and the ammonia plant was revamped and upgraded.\n\n\nThe facility"

      "SummaryText": " produces, handles, and stores large quantities of anhydrous ammonia in its operations.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water for the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with byproduct carbon dioxide to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce nitric acid which is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate. The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product.\n\nEach of these production units along with product ammonia storage and handling constitute the processes covered by the EPA Risk Management Program rule.  Regulated substances include the primary product of the plant, anhydrous ammonia, which is also the main feed stock for urea-ammonium nitrate production.  In addition, flammable substances as a class, and methane (natural gas) and hydrogen produced as an intermediate in ammonia production specifically, are regulated under Risk Management.  Finally, chlorine is also present in regulated threshold quantities on the site.

This Plan is coordinated with the local community response plan and is available to those responding agencies.  Emergency planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III has been provided to the State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other appropriate agencies such as the local fire department.\n\nThe facility is an active participant in the Local Emergency Planning Committee and interacts with various local agencies in its emergency planning such as local fire departments; law enforcement agencies such as the police, highway patrol, and sheriff's office; and hospitals.\n\nEmployees receive annual training in the response plan and also receive various safety training, both in general, and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the plan.  Periodically the plan is practiced in a table top, classroom type setting, and it also is drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe Fort Dodge Nitrogen Plant had two qualifying injuries in the past five years.

Since the incident, pump clearing procedures were changed to make the possibility of ammonia escaping during pump maintenance less likely.  Training on the new procedures was done immediately after the incident.\n\nThe Fort Dodge Nitrogen Plant had another qualifying injury in the past five years which occurred on October 17, 1998.  On that date, a relief valve lifted in the ammonia loading and unloading area of the plant which released ammonia in the loading area relief header system.  An experienced shift production foreman was in the area to correct the problem and a drop of liquid ammonia bypassed the safety glasses which he was wearing and ended up in his eye.  Since that incident, every employee at the Plant has received additional training on the importance of appropriate eye safety equipment and its proper use.\n\nSynopsis of Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Plan rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility, the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia and chlorine as regulated toxics, and flammables as a class which include methane and hydrogen.  The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance and a worst case flammable accident as a vapor cloud explosion.  Alternate scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general must also be presented.\n\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nBecause of the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by the ultimate consumer.  The RMP rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the wo"

This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia is held in an atmospheric storage tank, each of which contains 30,000 tons.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of a tank.  This unlikely event was modeled by a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events. Details of the results of this modeling are provided elsewhere in the Risk Management Plan Submittal.\n\nTo assure that the event indicated above was, in fact, the worst case as the rule defines it; failure of ammonia storage present at the site where ammonia is stored at higher pressure, but much lower quantities was also modeled.  In addition, a worst case failure of chlorine containers was similarly modeled.  Neither of these resulted in a distance greater than the circumstance noted above.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is so low as to be non-existent.  Many identical and similar tanks are in existence all over the world and have been in service for many years.  We are aware of no such failure of these tanks nor, even, lesser failures of a nature that would provide for an accidental release of quantities even orders of magnitude less than indicated above.  Analysis of this scenario is required by the rule, and, as such, was completed.  Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including these, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nWorst Case Flammable\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release"

In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia synthesis loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look Up Tables. Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small, especially considering the quantity of inert gasses and steam mixed with the flammable gases.  Impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nAlternate Case Toxics \n\n    Ammonia\n\nMore reasonably likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are throughout the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.  Such events can include failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.  \n\n\nThe alternate release scenario, modeled with the DEGADIS model for this facility consisted of an anhydrous ammonia truck driver leaving the loading station with the loading equipment still attached to his trailer.  This in turn, discharges the contents of the piping from the loading area up to the excess flow valves located at the loading area bullets.  Modeled impact distance is substantially lower for more reasonable, but not necessarily likely, release events.\n\n    Chlorine\n\nChlorine is used at several locations in this plant as a biocidal agent for cooling water systems, much as it is also used in swimming pools.  It is used as a gas from one ton chlorine cylinders through an injection system to the circulating cooling water.\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed is failure of the connecting tubing from the cylinder and release of gaseous chlorine.

The alternate scenario assumed a vapor cloud explosion as a result of a pressure relief valve in the ammonia synthesis loop lifting for 45 seconds.  The impact distance of this event utilized the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look Up Tables.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
