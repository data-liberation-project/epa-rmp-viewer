The facility utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperatures of Milk, Cream, and Ice Cream at 514 Division Street Madison, WI 53704.  Ammonia, a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, is used in an anhydrous form liquefied under pressure in a two stage process.  The refrigeration system consists of a High Pressure Receiver, Evaporators, Compressors, Condensers, Vessels, Piping and numerous types of Valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \n\nSchoep's Ice Cream Company is dedicated to promoting safe handling of hazardous materials for the sake of the Plant, Employees and Surrounding Community.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of federal regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained in such a way as to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  Also, these programs ensure the development of procedures that serve to minimize the impact of releases in the event that they do occur, as well as outlining proper emergency response steps.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nAs a part of its desire to promote the safety of its employees and the surrounding community, Schoep's Ice Cream Co. has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  Predominate among these programs is process safety management; PSM is organized into 14 elements. (Addressed in the same order as they are presented in the regulatory requirements.)\n\nElement 1-Employee Participation: PSM must involve "

A formal incident investigation must be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in (near miss), a catastrophic release of ammonia. For the purpose of this guideline, a catastrophic release is defined as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion involving ammonia that presents serious danger to employees, the employees of contractors working on site, or to off-site neighbors. Schoep's approach goes beyond the minimum requirements (because small occurrences can lead to larger ones), and Schoep's wants to learn/improve from our experiences. \n\nSpecific procedures that are followed to develop and maintain Schoep's incident investigation procedures are contained in Element 11, Incident Investigation.\n\nElement 12 -Emergency Planning and Response: Written emergency response plans are required for all ammonia refrigeration facilities.  Facilities must designate at least one plant contact to interface with emergency responders.
