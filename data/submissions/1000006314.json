CF Industries operates world-scale nitrogen fertilizer plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada; conducts phosphate mining and manufacturing operations in Central Florida; and distributes fertilizer products through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States.\n  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n     CF Industries, Inc., Plant City Phosphate Complex handles anhydrous ammonia, a commercial chemical that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Its most extensive use is in soil fertilization as a source of nitrogen, which is essential for plant growth.  The Plant City Phosphate Complex maintains an extensive safety program that ensures compliance with all applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations. In fact, the facility operates under a Corporate Policy that endorses going beyond regulatory requirements when prudent to enhance the protection of the health and safety of its employees and the public.  The design, maintenance and operation of this facility are carried out in compliance with this program and policy in order to provide safe operations and to prevent exposure of our employees and the nearby neighbors to ammonia.  \n\n     The FacilityA?s Emergency Response Plan is based upon OSHAA?s hazardous waste operations and emergency response standard [29 CFR 1910.120(q)].  The plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  Additional response procedures include: Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) trained operating and supervisory personnel, emergency response drills with local emergency responders, ammonia sensors located at critical locations in the process area, continuous monitoring of ammonia sensor r"

The ammonia is transferred from the railcars to pressurized ammonia tanks.  The ammonia is pumped from the tanks directly to the four granulation plants, where it is combined with phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  \n\n     The only substance regulated under EPAA?s RMP requirements at this facility is ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\n     The primary purpose of this facilityA?s Process Safety Management Program (PSM) is to safeguard our employees and nearby neighbors from exposure to ammonia by providing assistance in evaluating and updating the facilityA?s process and mechanical safety procedures and programs.  This facilityA?s Process Safety Management Program (PSM) was developed in compliance with OSHAA?s Process Safety Management Rule 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no ammonia releases that caused injury or property damage either on-site or off-site. \n \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nHAZMAT training is performed in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 (g) and pre-emergency planning and drills have been conducted with outside responders.  The emergency response program conforms to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The HAZMAT team has conducted joint training and drills with the local fire departments.  Facility personnel have conducted meetings informing the public of the facilityA?s Emergency Response Program.  The facility uses the Incident Command System that "
