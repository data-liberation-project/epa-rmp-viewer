We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the safety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage. We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck and store it as a liquid in pressurized vessels. Access to the process is restricted to authorized employees and contractors. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 60,000 gallons (water capacity).\n\n\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of one 30,000 gallon tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity (85% @ 60 F), resulting in a release of anhydrous ammonia. The distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles, based on the EPA RMP Comp. This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to be 900 residents, commercial/industrial areas, recreation areas,a school, nursing home, and Job Corps, facility within the distance to endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is failure of a 12 foot length of 1 1/4 inch hose due to a cracked hose or failed fitting. The operator observes the leak and isolates the hose by closing the shut-off valves. The contents of the hose are re"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI K-61.1, OSHA 1910.111 and state law.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWe maintain safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our anhydrous ammonia storage facilities.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Review\n\nOur Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) team conducts comprehensive studies and reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. These activities are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWe maintain written operating procedures for operation of the anhydrous ammonia storage facility. These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is readily accessible to operators.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nOur EHSS team performs thorough annual maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations. B"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes:pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are performed by qualified personnel that have been trained in safe maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nWe conduct compliance audits on a regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are performed at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nDue to our comprehensive safety program, this facility has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIt is company policy for each of our facilities to maintain an Emergency Action Plan & Emergency Response Plan. This plan addresses chemical inventory, evacuation procedures and instructions for notifying emergency response agencies. This plan is reviewed on an annual basis and is included in the employee training program. In the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe will continue to implement o"
