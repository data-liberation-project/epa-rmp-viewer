      "SummaryText": "The McKamie Gas Plant is an on-shore natural gas processing facility located on County Road 36, Lafayette County, near Stamps, Arkansas.  The facility was constructed in the early 1940s by the predecessors of Arco and Exxon, and was designed to process sweet and sour natural gas.  Phillips Petroleum acquired the Plant in 1969.  In December 1998, MKP Production Company, L.L.C. (MKP), who owned and operated the facility at that time, and affiliated entities filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Energy Income Fund, L.P. (EIF), the primary secured creditor of the McKamie Gas Plant assets, filed a Plan of Liquidation with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court  to protect EIF's security interest in those assets. Under the plan of liquidation approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Longview Gas Company, an EIF affiliate will become the owner of the facility.\n\nThe Plant has been temporarily shut down since April 1999.  It is anticipated that the Plant will be re-activated in February 2000.\n\nWhen in operation, the Plant produces butane liquids, propane liquids, and natural gasoline from gas feed.  The Plant will consist of two residual compressor engines, a steam boiler, a sulfur recovery unit, an emergency flare, two refrigerant compressor engines, two overhead compressor engines, a glycol reconcentrator, a regeneration gas heater, a heat medium heater, and a nitrogen rejection unit.\n\nThe Plant is capable of processing up to 15 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) of natural gas when operational; however, it had only been processing 9 to 10 mmscf/d of natural gas before it was shut down.  \n\nThe following is a summary of the facility's risk management program, which has been developed in preparation for the re-activation of the facility.\n\n\n1.

These programs provide information regarding personnel training in accidental release and response procedures, process operations, and health and safety practices; written operation and maintenance procedures for each process; hazard analysis and response; and hazard communication.  It is Longview Gas Company's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances, as well as train personnel to respond, control, and mitigate releases, if necessary.   \n\n2. FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nWhen operational, the McKamie Gas Plant processes gas from the following production fields:\n\n7 Low-pressure sour gas and liquids from the McKamie-Patton Unit; and,\n\n7 High-pressure sweet gas and liquids from the Dorcheat-Macedonia Field.\n\nLow-pressure sour gas from the McKamie-Patton Unit enters an inlet separator where gas and condensate are separated.  High-pressure sweet gas from the Dorcheat-Macedonia Field enters the high-pressure inlet separator where the gas and condensate are separated.  Condensate from both separators is directed to the condensate stabilization unit where light ends are volatilized.  Condensate from the stabilization unit is blended with liquids from the de-propanizer.  This blend is sent to the de-butanizer where butane is removed and sent to pressurized storage.  The remaining liquids (natural gasoline, pentanes and heavier) are also sent to pressurized storage.\n\nLow-pressure sour gas from the low-pressure inlet separator and the volatilized light ends from the condensate stabilization unit are compressed and combined with the high-pressure sweet gas stream.  This combined stream is sent to the amine contactor where Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) are removed by the lean amine solution in the contactor.  Heat from the sulfur recovery unit (SRU) waste stream is used to regenerate the rich amine solution.  Acid gas produced during th"

Liquid molten sulfur is loaded into trucks and transported from the Plant.  H2S not converted into elemental sulfur is converted to SO2 in the SRU incinerator.\n\nThe sweetened natural gas flows from the amine contactor to the Triethylene Glycol (TEG) contactor for dehydration.  Natural gas encounters a counter-flowing stream of lean TEG in the contactor where water vapor is absorbed from the gas stream.  The dehydrated natural gas exits the contactor and the rich TEG (water laden) is sent to the TEG reboiler for regeneration.  A natural gas fired reboiler heats the rich TEG to approximately 375: F.  This heating produces a gas stream consisting mostly of water and TEG vapor, with entrained Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).  This gas stream is sent to a reflux condenser where the gas is cooled, allowing the TEG to condense.  The lean TEG is then routed back to the contactor.  The cooled gas stream, now consisting mostly of water vapor and entrained VOCs, exits the reflux condenser vent and is further cooled in a secondary condenser where water and condensable VOCs (mostly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene - (BTEX)) are removed and sent to storage.  Vapors from the secondary condenser vent do not vent to the atmosphere, but are recycled back into the process.\n\nThe sweetened, dry natural gas is sent to a mole sieve dehydration unit for additional water vapor removal in preparation for the cryogenic unit.  The only air emissions associated with the mole sieve unit are from the regeneration gas heater used to regenerate the mole sieve beds.  The natural gas stream is next sent to the Joule-Thompson cryogenic unit where ethane and heavier components are extracted from the gas in liquid form, and sent to pressurized storage.  \n\nThe ethane and heavier liquids stream is sent to the de-ethanizer where ethane and lighter components are separated and mix"

The remaining liquid, consisting of pentanes and heavier components, is also sent to pressurized storage.  Propane, butane and natural gasoline are periodically loaded into trucks and sold.  A direct-fired heater provides the process heat for the de-ethanizer, de-propanizer and de-butanizer.\n\nLongview plans to reactivate an existing nitrogen rejection unit (NRU) for the removal of nitrogen in the sales gas stream.  The NRU will add one additional process vent. \n\nThe current air permit calls for the emergency flare to be disconnected, but not dismantled. However, the facility can not be operated safely without the availability of a flare.  Consequently, Longview has submitted a permit modification application to allow for the emergency use of the flare.  The flare will only be used to safely vent the gas that would be blown down in an emergency, unless otherwise authorized by the appropriate regulatory agencies.  The flare will not be used to burn acid gas in the event that the SRU is not operating, unless otherwise authorized.  \n\nNatural gas liquids (NGL) (propane, butane, pentane, ethane, natural gasoline, and condensate) and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) are the regulated substances that are processed and stored at the facility in amounts above the threshold limit.  \n\n3.

This means that the worst-case and alternative-case analyses for the toxic substance need to be addressed for H2S. The natural gas process involves regulated flammable substance such as propane, butane, pentane, ethane, natural gasoline, and condensate in amounts that exceed the threshold quantity. This means that the worst-case and alternative-case analyses also need to be addressed for these substances. \n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable substances is focused on a release consisting of the entire contents of all five pressurized storage tanks located in the same area, and the contents from the large storage tank located on the other side of the facility (a total of six tanks).  The alternative-case scenario, however, focuses on a release that would consist of the contents from one of the five storage tanks and the large storage tank located on the other side of the facility.\n\nFlammable Substance\nWorst Case:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance consists of an instantaneous release of NGL from six storage tanks and a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the flammable substance will form a vapor cloud and no liquids will be released due to inadequate pressure.  Therefore, the use of passive mitigation systems, such as storage tank containment dikes, will not be applicable due to the nature of the substance released.  It is predicted that a worst-case release will have an off-site impact.

Passive mitigation measures, such as the use of storage tank containment dikes, will contain the liquids, if present.  However, in this case, it is assumed that the NGL will vaporize due to the absence of adequate pressure and the vapors will ignite in a vapor cloud fire.

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe McKamie Gas Plant is subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  The practices employed at this facility which are most important to the PSM accident prevention program are described in more detail below.  This accident prevention program is also applied to all RMP covered processes at the McKamie Gas Plant.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the McKamie Gas Plant's PSM program will be an important step toward achieving the objective of preventing or minimizing the effects of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas will be implemented.  Open communication will be encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe McKamie Gas Plant will strive to promote employee involvement in developing and implementing safety and accident prevention standards.  Safety meetings, special training programs for emergency response and first aid, and hazard communication training will be scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that employees are properly trained in health and safety issues and have the opportunity to voice their concerns regarding such issues.  Employees will also be encouraged to discuss safety and accident prevention practices with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe McKamie Gas Plant will maintain complete and accurate process safety information records concerning process chemicals, technology, and "

This information will be presented to the contractors during an orientation session that will be conducted prior to the start of work.  The orientation session will also include a review of process operations, safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\nThe McKamie Gas Plant will conduct a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) of any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment will be appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service, that all construction will be completed in accordance with design specifications, and that all supporting systems will be operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements will be properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe McKamie Gas Plant will establish practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program will include employee training, a written process equipment maintenance manual, regularly scheduled inspections and tests of process equipment, the correction of any process equipment deficiencies as needed and within a timely manner, and the application of quality assurance measures in equipment purchases and repairs.

Operation and maintenance personnel will then be provided the necessary training on the change.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program requirements of the PSM program, the McKamie Gas Plant has installed safety devices on process equipment in order to ensure the safe operation of all processes.  These devices aid in the detection, containment and/or control, and mitigation of accidental releases of regulated substances within the facility.  (Detection devices include process detectors and alarms; containment and/or control devices including process relief valves, isolation valves, automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters, atmospheric relief devices, and redundant equipment and instrumentation, such as an uninterruptible power supply for process control systems; and mitigation devices include fire suppression and extinguishing systems and personal protective equipment, such as chemical protective clothing and self-contained breathing apparatus).  Collectively, these preventio"

Longview Gas Company will continue to monitor developments in safety devices and equipment to ensure that the McKamie Gas Plant will operate in the safest manner possible.\n\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe McKamie Gas Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past five years, there has only been one minor incident at this facility. This incident occurred in December 1997 and was caused by the failure of a seal in the poly pipeline, which caused a gas leak. The responder was immediately notified when the incident happened. There were no on-site or off-site deaths or injuries caused by the incident. The faulty seal was replaced immediately after the incident was discovered. \n\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe McKamie Gas Plant will maintain a written emergency response manual to provide employees with information regarding worker protection and public safety in the event of a fire or explosion caused by the accidental release of a flammable or toxic substance.  The procedures will address the notification of local emergency response agencies, post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and employee training requirements.  The emergency response manual will be updated when modifications are made to the McKamie Gas Plant facilities and changes are administered through the management of change process.  \n\nThe emergency response program for the McKamie Gas Plant will be developed to work in coordination with the Lafayette County Sheriff Department, the Stamps Fire Department, and the Arkansas State Police Department. Around-the-clock communications will be established between these departments and the McKamie Gas Plant, as well as the appropriate local emergency planning commission (LEPC) officials and other emergency response organizations.  Periodic meetings of the emergency response committee will facilit"
