      "SummaryText": "BASF Corporation (BASF) has a vision to provide innovative solutions meeting the needs of our customers in line with the global principles of Responsible Care and Sustainable Development. To meet our vision, we conduct our business with respect and care for the environment and without compromising the health and safety of people, whether employees, customers, or citizens around the world. Facility and organization management fully supports the implementation of process safety at the plant. It is our policy to proactively implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases. If such a release does occur, our first concerns are for the safety of our employees, the safety of the community, and the protection of the environment. Furthermore, it is our policy to work cooperatively with the local fire department on emergency response matters.\n\n\n\nThe facility produces cotton seed. Cotton seed is received from cotton gins, delinted and cleaned, treated, and then packaged for distribution to customers. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride, a regulated substance, is used in the delinting process. \n\n\n\nWorst-case Release: The worst-case release scenario is modeled as the release of anhydrous HCl from one HCl cylinder stored at the tractor trailer over a period of 10 minutes. It is noted that there will not be more than one HCl cylinder operating at the same time. Therefore, the maximum release quantity is 3,500 pounds and the modeled maximum release rate is 350 pounds per minute. In addition, the worst-case release of the toxic gas is considered to release in an enclosed space due to the effect of water curtain. For a release of a toxic gas in an enclosed but not air-tight space, the rate of release of the gas to the atmosphere is 55 percent of the release rate if the release were happening outdoors. As such, the release rate is calculated as 193 pounds per minute. \n\nAt the anhydrous HCl toxic endpoint of 0.03 mg/L, the calculated release rate and using urban topography, the dist"

      "SummaryText": "ance to the toxic endpoint is 1.9 miles, which was calculated using EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario #1: Process Piping Releases \n\nHCl in the presence of moisture is highly corrosive. A likely release scenarios involves corrosion of the process piping resulting in a release. This scenario assumes there is a 1/2 inch hole developed from corrosion and results in a release of gaseous HCl at 800 psig at 90 Fahrenheit. This is selected as one of the alternative release scenarios and the release rate is calculated per EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance equation 7-1. The scenario assumes that the piping releases for at least 10 minutes, resulting a distance of 0.7 miles to the listed toxic endpoint. \n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario #2: Process Vessel Seal Failure\n\nIn 2013, there was an accidental release of the anhydrous HCl due to the deterioration of a silver washer in a pressure release valve on the HCl cylinder. During this accident, a total of 528 pounds HCl gas was released during an 18 hours period. This is considered as another alterative release scenario and is added in this updated RMP report. This scenario assumes a release rate of 0.5 pounds per minute, which is based on the total released HCl (i.e., 528 pounds) in 18 hours. The scenario assumes that the piping releases for at least 1,080 minutes (i.e., 18 hours), resulting a distance of less than 0.1 miles to the listed toxic endpoint. \n\n\n\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. Employees are trained to recognize the hazards of the process and all changes to the process are reviewed to ensure that the safety, health, and environmental consequences of the change are addressed prior to the implementation of the change. The facility is also subject to OSHA's PSM rule. No reportable accidental release has occurred in the past five years at the Erskine Facility.\n\n\n\n"
