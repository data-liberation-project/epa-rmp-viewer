The light naphtha will be sold as fuel to a neighboring power generator and used for refinery fuel. The heavy naphtha will be returned to the TAPS in the existing return oil system.  For the purposes of this unit, heavy is defined as components with a true boiling point (TBP) of 175\u00b0F or greater and lights have a TBP less than 175\u00b0F.   The new unit includes several new pieces of equipment: a new distillation tower, reboiler, condenser, overhead accumulator, feed/bottoms exchanger and two (2) new sets of pumps. Existing refinery equipment has been modified to incorporate the new unit and allow for flexibility in operating modes.  \r\n\r\nSignificant hazards at the facility are hydrocarbons processed and transported at elevated temperatures and pressures and streams containing high concentrations of Hydrogen Sulfide.  There are numerous hazardous chemicals stored and used on site that present potential exposure hazards ranging from minor irritants to highly corrosive caustics and acids.  A full list of chemicals stored on site can be found in the facility Hazardous Communications Program.   The substance regulated by 40 CFR 68 present at the facility in quantities exceeding the minimum threshold are flammable liquids.\r\n\r\nCATASTROPHIC RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe first line of defense to preventing a release to the atmosphere is in the facility design.  Generally accepted and good engineering practices have been used to design the facility and continue to be used as the facility is changed and modified.  Safe design includes the construction of each piece of equipment as well as the process controls put into place to prevent systems from exceeding their design intention.  Other critical design features are emergency shutdown systems an"

The 8 spur ties into a 14 branch line that runs 2.8 miles from the main Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) to the Flint Hills Refinery.  The 14 branch line, 8 spur line and metering station are owned and maintained by Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA).\r\n\r\nThe crude oil leaves the metering building under TAPS pressure of approximately 300 psig and is pre-heated prior to entering the Crude tank T-203 (H).\r\n\r\nCrude oil is then pumped through a series of heat exchangers prior to entering the Flash Tower (V-100) at approximately 325\u00b0F.\r\n\r\nThe lighter fractions of the crude oil called Light Straight Run (LSR) are flashed off in the flash tower, then condensed and accumulated in the overhead receiver.  A portion of the LSR is pumped back to the Flash Tower as reflux, a portion is used as fuel for the Crude Heater, and the remainder is pumped back into the ARC prior to returning to TAPS.\r\n\r\nFlashed Crude is pumped from the Flash Tower through a series of heat exchangers prior to entering the Crude Heater at about 450\u00b0F. Flashed Crude flows through the heater through two identical passes exiting at approximately 630\u00b0F.  The crude heater consists of ten burners fueled primarily with fuel gas off the main crude column.  LSR off the flash tower overhead is used as a secondary trim fuel to control the desired temperature of the crude exiting the heater.\r\n\r\nCrude enters the fractionating column as two phase flow.  The crude column consists of a 120' vessel with 37 fractionation trays numbered from top to the bottom.  The lighter material rises through the column where it is progressively cooled until the individual components condense.  Diesel, Kerosene, and Heavy Naphtha are pulled off the side of the tower while the lightest material (Light Naphtha) is pulled off the top, condensed and accum"

Operating procedures are developed for every stage of operations to assure that the facility is operated safely and within its design intentions.  Safe practices such as hot work permits, good house keeping, opening process equipment and car program.   Affected employees are training initially and periodically to ensure a competent safely run workforce.\r\n\r\nA third line of defense is the inspection, testing and preventive maintenance programs to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  This includes monitoring the integrity of piping, tanks, vessels, safety systems, rotating equipment, instrumentation and other equipment for deficiencies and correcting those deficiencies when they are outside of acceptable limits. \r\n\r\nA fourth line of defense to preventing hazardous release is to conduct periodic hazards analysis of the facility design, procedures, safe practices and human factors to ensure that all of the elements of a safe facility are functioning safely.  Process Hazards Analyses are conducted when a facility or process is initially designed and at least every 5 years thereafter.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nWhile the Petro Star North Pole Refinery has experienced some incidents and accidents during its operating history, no accidents have occurred which meet the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nAn on-site emergency response team is trained to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release. Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, sheriff, rescue, etc.). Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams. Additional training with outside organizations is also conducted.\r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\nThe Petro Star North Pole Refinery routinely includes safety enhancements and improvements in its annual budgets and capital expenditure plans."
