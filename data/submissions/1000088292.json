State regulations require reporting when there is a significant release or a threat of a significant release of ammonia or other hazardous material.  Mercer Foods interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury. \n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nB-2   STATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system/process is a direct, closed loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Mercer refrigeration system and is the only regulated substance.\n\n\n\nB-3    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nMercer Foods Prevention Program is described in the CalARP program.  The Prevention Program implemented by Mercer Foods is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nKey objectives of Mercer Foods Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information.  The facility has retained the original manufacturer OEM manuals, equipment drawings, etc. for reference purposes and aid in maintenance activities. (Addressed under the Safety Information Element)\n\n\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The types of natural and human caused external events considered in the hazard review include: \n\n?    earthquake, tornado, extreme severe weather, flood (see above for parameters used in the seismic analysis)\n\n?    inadequate physical security devices (locks, lighting, fence"

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Review study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  In addition, some of these elements are reviewed and trained on annually or every three years or if a change is made at minimum as required by the code and industry standards. This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\n\n\nSecond, all Mercer Foods employees and at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.
