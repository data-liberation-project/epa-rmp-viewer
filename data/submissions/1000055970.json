Therefore these chemicals must be considered in the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. Butane storage has the potential to include the greatest quantity of a covered flammable substance, therefore butane is the modeled substance.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario analyses were calculated by using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) software RMP*Comp version 2.01.  The worst-case scenario involves a release of 488,215 lbs. of liquefied butane, which results in a one-psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance impacts only industrial/commercial receptors. No engineering controls were considered for this scenario. \n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for this process is a break in transfer hose connection, resulting in a vapor cloud fire. This scenario could result in release of 481 lbs. of butane per minute.  The maximum distance for this scenario is <0.1 miles as calculated by RMP*Comp. This distance impacts only industrial/commercial receptors. The process maintains mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  \n\n\n\nA preliminary seismic walkthrough was conducted to fulfill the requirements of CalARP, 19 CCR Part 2745.7 (q)(2). The preliminary seismic walkthrough consisted of a visual inspection of the process area piping and vessels above grade.  Structural integrity below grade was not inspected.  Walkthrough considerations included the mechanical integrity of pipe, pipe supports, vessels and vessel supports, welds, flanges, valves, pressure safety valves, signs of surface corrosion, pipe stress points, foundation, drainage direction, fire control and interaction with other elements.\n\n\n\nThe references used for this walkthrough we"
