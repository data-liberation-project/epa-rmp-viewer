Employees responsible for the storage and handling of regulated materials are required by company policy to complete extensive training, both classroom and on-the-job, before being allowed to perform sensitive operations.  This involves operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  Employees also receive periodic refresher training to maintain skills and awareness.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan includes specific instructions for employees and contract personnel to follow in the event of an accidental release.  Activation of this plan will place in motion a series of events specifically designed to minimize the impact of the release to our employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  As an integral part of the Emergency Action Plan, our facility actively participates in the dome storage area mutual response group, Petal Dome Mutual Aid (PDMA).\n\nPDMA is made up of eight LP-Gas and natural gas facilities and transporation companies in the immediate area.  PDMA was established in the late 1970's.  PDMA,  Forrest County Emergency Management District, and Civil Defense have sucessfully worked with the surrounding community emergency response agencies and local and state governmental agencies to provide efficient, timely response to emergency situations in any of the participating facilities.  Our company, along with PDMA, is actively involved in the Forrest County/Hattiesburg Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

It is our intention, and pleasure, to continue the relationship we enjoy with local and state government, industry neighbors, and community.\n\nIf an emergency were to occur at our facility, it is our policy to activate our Emergency Action Plan.  Through the activation of this plan, emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and over the inter-plant/Civil Defense radio-alarm system monitored by each facility, the Emergency Management District, and Petal Police Department.  The 911 call is channeled through the Forrest County Sheriff's Department to the Macedonia Volunteer Fire Department and all area emergency response agencies.\n\nA facility description and the regulated products handled:  Delta Facility is a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage facility providing bulk storage for wholesale marketing.  The facility consists of ten (10) 30,000 -- 33,000 gallon LPG storage tanks, one 2,400 gallon LPG storage tank, truck and rail loading/unloading stations, pumps, compressors, valves, and piping.  Propane and butanes (LPG) are the regulated substances handled and stored in this process.\n\nThe worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):  Our worst-case scenario is failure of a 33,000 gallon LPG storage tank when filled with the greatest amount allowed (88 % of capacity at 60 degrees F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  There will be off-site consequences.  This incident carries a very low degree of probability compared to other more probable incidents.\n\nOur alternative release scenario involves a pipe on the discharge of the pump breaking during the loading process resulting in 11,000 lbs of propane being released with a vapor cloud explosion occurring.  This incident carries a slightly higher degree of probability of occurrence than our worst-case scenario and there will be off-site consequences.\n\nThe"

The cost of maintaining the Petal Police Department alarm system is paid by the PDMA members.\n\nUnder the Petal Dome Mutual Aid/Emergency Management District response plan, trained PDMA personnel respond initially by securing the area with:  (1) roadblocks to prevent exposure to passersby; (2) assisting as needed in initial evacuation; (3) stopping and/or slowing operations as far as practical; and (4) reporting to the Command Post with any specialized equipment and trained personnel available to aid in containing or the controlling the incident.  A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed.\n\nAn immediate evaluation by facility personnel, the responding fire chief, and the EMD Director will determine the effect range with rapid notification being made to AAA Ambulance for evacuation of ambulatory residents located inside the determined zone.  Those located closest to the incident are evacuated first with the evacuation broadening until the safe zone perimeter is reached.  Residents requiring specialized care are transported to the local hospital of their choice while those merely displaced and in need of shelter are transported to a local motel.  Periodic contact with residents located near the facilities enables the timely evacuation of these residents at the expense of the affected facility.

This training involves both classroom instruction and hands-on fire control and suppression using both water and dry-chemical.  Our facility, in conjunction with PDMA, supports the training of our local emergency response agencies, including paid and volunteer fire departments, through monetary contributions for equipment and supplies as well as providing time and fuel to train on PDMA fire-fighting apparatus.  Our company also works, through local fire response agencies, with the Mississippi State Fire Academy in providing fuel for burns using the Academy portable apparatus.\n\nEmployees of this facility are issued individual copies of the Emergency Action Plan when initially hired and the plan is reviewed in a timely manner.  Updates to the plan are provided to all employees and the Emergency Action Plan is exercised in regular drills involving all facility personnel.  This Emergency Action Plan and drill have been reviewed by the Emergency Management District Director and deemed to be acceptable.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Our facility has been directly involved in planning and support for installation of a Reverse 911 system for the Forrest County/Hattiesburg Emergency Response area.
