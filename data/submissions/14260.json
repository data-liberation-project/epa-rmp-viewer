DMC Prints Inc. has never had a release or spill that would constitute an emergency, but if an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Orangeburg, South Carolina Fire Department Emergency Response Unit and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\n1.2    Description of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDMC Prints is an industrial facility engaged in the Dyeing, Printing, and Finishing of Fabric for resale.  We use the propane for the operation of fork lift trucks and to fire manufacturing operations required by our plant facility.  The propane system consists of one 30,000 gallon propane tank and associated piping, valves, burners, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n1.3    Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest quantity determined (80% at 60oF) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a  2\" pipe leading to a 10-minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and Industrial receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n1.4    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDMC Prints complies with the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 LP Gas Code, 1998 Edition, and State law.\n\n1.5    Five-Year Accident Histor"

DMC Prints has discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNone required at this time."
