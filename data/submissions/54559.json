The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM). The PSM program is executed through YEXs partner, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a stakeholder in the YLLC operation and has offices and staff on-site.  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  It is the primary goal of YEX and WPS to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations. \n\n\n\nYEX has adopted a non-responding facility policy; has an established Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submission of appropriate Reports and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nWPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.

Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  \n\n\n\nEach company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training (production workers contracted by YEX are trained for their emergency actions.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their emergency actions).\n\n\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Yuma Express facility is located in Yuma, AZ in a commercial/industrial area outside the city.    The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (produce) and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage.  The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and subsequent short-term storage is on-site generally four days from harvesting.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods beginning in mid-November and finishing in early April. \n\n\n\nThe refrigerant in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to augment the fixed equipment at the facility. Due to the seasonal operation of the Plant, the refrigerant is removed and placed in storage vessels at the end of each season.  The vessels are rated at higher pressure and temperature than the equipment it is transferred out of.  The storage vessels are provided shade, traffic barriers and a water sprinkler system.  The water sprinkler system reduces pressure and temperature by reducing the skin temperature of the vessels on very hot days in the Yuma area.   \n\n\n\nOperation of the facility is a coordinate"

Yuma Express Cooling, LLC is an Arizona Limited Liability Company made up of Western Precooling Systems (WPS) - 50 % and a group of individuals and entities affiliated with American Growers Cooling LLC (AGCC) - 50 %.  Yuma Express Cooling, LLC leases the site including stationary refrigeration equipment to AGCC.  Separately, WPS leases portable refrigeration equipment to AGCC. Maintenance of the entire refrigeration system is the responsibility of WPS which has offices and staff about 100 yards from the site. WPS and AGCC work together to implement the Risk and Process Safety Management Plan which is in the name of Yuma Express Cooling, LLC.\n\n\n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program  has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site's RMP/PSM Plan.\n\n\n\nAs stated above, WPS is the company that maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the site.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to teardown and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.

Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves are now used as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated. The facility uses these types of valves at all oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at Yuma Express Cooling, LLC:\n\n - The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility and to increase the security of the facility from potential wrong-doers.\n\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandals etc.  Training is documented in each employees training record file.\n\n - Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n\n - A Security Service is employed on-site to control casual visitors (truck drivers reporting to pick-up produce).\n\n - There is a controlled pressure receiver installed for daily operational swing capacity.\n\n - An evaporative cooling water sprinkler system has been installed over the receiver to reduce pressure during sustained hot weather.\n\n - An ammonia monitoring, sensing and warning system is installed.\n\n - WPS played a leading role instituting the Yuma-Area Ammonia Safety Day scheduled annually for November.

In this way, WPS has established relationships and a higher degree of coordination with Fire Departments that may be involved in ammonia response activities on an area-wide basis.  WPS has been engaged with local emergency coordination efforts since February, 1994.\n\n - Education and prevention of ammonia incidents is a primary focus of the Yuma Ammonia Safety Day.  WPS and YLLC personnel attend these events on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidental releases at the site over the last five years.  There is no data to report.\n\n\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Production workers contracted by YLLC are trained to notify and evacuate via the Plant?s Emergency Action Plan.  Only the Yuma Fire Department (and other responding agencies via Mutual Aid Agreement) would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.
