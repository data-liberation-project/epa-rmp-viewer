The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at The ExxonMobil BRPO facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at The ExxonMobil BRPO facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil BRPO facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n3.

The primary operation of the facility is the production of HDPE at a rate of up to 2.2 billion pounds per year.  Ethylene and comonomers are metered into a recirculating loop reactor.  Polyethylene is produced in small particles and is recirculated as a slurry in the isobutane.  Isobutane, as well as small amount of unreacted ethylene and comonomers, are recovered and recycled back to the reactor.  Polyethylene product is dried and sold as a powder or pellet. ExxonMobil BRPO also operates a polypropylene unit.  This unit uses processes similar to the polyethylene facility. This process uses propylene as the raw material.  The unit began operation in early May 2000.   Fuels used at the plant include natural gas, gasoline, and diesel.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil BRPO was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, ExxonMobil BRPO identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  \r\n\r\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at ExxonMobil BRPO are isobutane, ethylene/isobutane mixture, hydrogen, 1-butene and propylene/propane mixture.  Based on worst-case analyses of the regulated substances, the distances to endpoints exceed the distances to public receptors.  In addition, ExxonMobil BRPO is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, ExxonMobil BRPO is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP Program.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at ExxonMobil BRPO plant.
