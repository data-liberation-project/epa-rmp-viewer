      "SummaryText": "The Bridge Facility is a newly constructed natural gas processing plant located in Ute Indian Territory.  It is located 19.5 miles south of Vernal Utah on Highway 45, and 13.5 miles west on CR3260.  The facility consists of five natural gas compressor engines that are being used to recompress the natural gas, one natural gas engine that is used to circulate propane, two 30,000 gallon LPG tanks, a 2,000 propane tank, a propane refrigeration skid, and numerous other atmospheric hydrocarbon tanks.   Since the facility is newly constructed in 2005, there have been no accidents in the last five years.\n\nIn calculating the worst case scenario and alternate scenario the LPG was approximated as propane.  For the worst case scenario, the weight of 60,000 gallons of propane was used, since the propane tanks are next to each other and it was determined that a catastrophic failure of one tank could conceivable cause the failure of the other tank.\n\nWestport Field Services understands the need for safety, both on and off site.  Bridge Station is not subject to the Process Safety Management regulations, but Westport Field Services has decided to prepare a PSM plan for the facility anyway, to ensure that all necessary safety procedures are in place, and being followed.  The PSM plan addresses the facility's accidental release prevention and emergency response plan.  In addition, there are many other procedures in place, such as Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Prestartup Safety Review, Contractor Management, Process Hazard Analysis, and Process Safety Information that help minimize any potential accidental releases at the Station.\n\nIf there were to be an emergency the primary concern is the rapid evacuation of all employees from the area.  Immediately following, notification of emergency personnel, and keeping others from entering the danger zone.\n\nThe facility has a continuing improvement program, which consists of the Process Hazard Analyses, Man"
