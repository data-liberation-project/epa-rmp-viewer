              "Description": " PREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  Fieldale Farms Corporation takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Fieldale Farms management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: Process Safety Information(PSI), Process Hazard Analysis(PHA),\nOperation Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity(MI), Management of Change(MOC), Pre-startup Review, Compliance Audits, Hot Work Permits and Contractors.  \nThese individual elements of our accident prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Fieldale Farms company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems are designed, installed and maintained in accordance with the PSM rule and the International Institure of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) consensus standards.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we meet both IIAR and our own high standards for accident prevention.     \n1.  In accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule and Section 1910.119(d) of the Process Safety Management(PSM) rule Fieldale Farms systematically controls the creation, updating and retention of written documentation associated with our process chemicals, process technology and process equipment.
