The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been filed with the USEPA as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  In addition, a revised RMP has ben filed with the cognizant Administering Agency, Fremont Fire Department Hazardous Materials Program, as required by California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations at 19 CCR Sections 2735 - 2795.  This revision is a re-validation and update as required every five years by Federal and California regulations.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nGlacier Ice Co.'s Fremont Ice Packaging Facility is located at 43960 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, CA in Alameda County, and uses anhydrous ammonia, an RS, to charge the refrigeration system.  The anhydrous ammonia charge in the system is greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  There are 25 full-time employees at this site.

The entire plant site is enclosed by a chain link perimeter fence, and all gates are kept locked when the plant is not manned.\n\nBulk anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and charged into the high pressure receiver under pressure.  The ammonia refrigeration system serves the ice makers, a water chiller, and evaporators for room air cooling.  The system is totally self-contained, and the only losses of ammonia are minor in nature, from periodic oil draining operations, minor valve packing leaks, and the like.  Every few years, additional ammonia is added to the system to replace losses.\n\nThe refrigeration process operates generally as follows.  Compressors raise the pressure and temperature of ammonia vapor to hot gas condition, approximately 165 psig and 120 deg. F.  The vapor is condensed to liquid in evaporative condensers located outside the building, transferring heat to circulating water which evaporates.  Fans operate as necessary to increase the rate of water evaporation.  The condensed liquid ammonia drains into the high pressure receiver, and the pressurized liquid enters the flash subcooler.  In the flash subcooler, the high pressure liquid is reduced in temperature from approximately 90 deg. F to approximately 30 deg. F, and reduced in pressure from 165 psig to approximately 45 psig.  The subcooled liquid enters two recirculation accumulator vessels where its temperature and pressure are further reduced.  Liquid ammonia pumps force the cold liquid ammonia through the ice maker heat exchanger plates and the evaporator coils, and as the ammonia picks up heat it partially boils and two-phase flow returns to the respective recirculation accumulators.  Suction piping carries ammonia vapor from each of the two recirculation accumulators and the suction accumulator to the compressors where the refrigeration cycle begins again.\n\nDefrosting is carr"

The partially condensed gas is returned to the recirculation accumulators with the two-phase pumped liquid return flow.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Glacier Ice Co. that the receipt and handling of anhydrous ammonia at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Glacier Ice Co. has gathered safety information on anhydrous ammonia and on the process, equipment and procedures involving anhydrous ammonia; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Glacier Ice Co. are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nGlacier Ice Co. has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA requierments at 8 CCR 5189 covering the ammonia refrigeration process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for operations at this facility.

It has been coordinated with the City of Fremont Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures which Glacier Ice Co. committed to accomplish have been completed.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
