The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this document, the scenarios described, and modeling techniques selected were chosen  based on the criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled: \n\nThe stationary source is the APCI main production facility located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, Kentucky. The three RMP covered processes are the Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVOH) unit, the Emulsions unit, and the VAM storage and distribution unit.  \n\nIn the PVOH unit, VAM is polymerized in a solvent to make polyvinyl acetate (PVAc).  PVAc is converted to polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), which is ground to a granule, dried, stored, packaged and shipped in bags, trucks and railcars.  PVOH is a water soluble powder that is used in applications such as water-based adhesives and to protect fibers as they are woven to fabrics. \n\nIn the Emulsions unit, VAM is polymerized in water to polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), Ethylene and/or  vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) may also be polymerized in water with or without VAM.  A number of other chemicals that are not covered by the RMP regulations, may be used to adjust the properties for specific end uses.  Emulsions products are used in many applications including adhesives, latex paints and paper coatings.\n\nThe VAM storage and distribution area at the main production facility receives VAM from tanks at the Tennessee River and stores it on site to continuously supply the PVOH and Emulsions production facilities.  \n\nThe regulated substances handled at this stationary source are:\n\n1.  Vinyl Acetate with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of   433,000 pounds.\n2.  Ethylene with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of            237,000  pounds\n3.  Vinyl Chloride with a maximum quantity in an individual process of       60,000 pounds. \n\n3.  The \"worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, inc"

Because the explosive release of energy is greater for ethylene than VCM, ethylene was chosen as the source for the flammable scenarios.  \n\nIn the plant, the greatest VAM inventory is contained in either of two storage tanks,    FB-1510 and FB-1511.  Under worst case conditions of a single tank failure, the entire contents of the tank, 436,800 pounds of VAM would be released from the tank and be contained in an earthen dike around the tanks. Using the EPA lookup tables for rural terrain, the vaporized VAM would spread to an endpoint that would exceed plant boundaries.  Although there are active controls directed at preventing such a release and controlling the consequences, no credit was taken for active mitigation methods in evaluating this Worst Case Scenario. \n\nThe alternative case for a toxic liquid at the plant is the overpressure of a PVOH polymerization  reactor and a subsequent VAM release from the pressure relief system.  A similar incident occurred at Calvert City in 1992 and at a similar facility in 1996. It was calculated that 5,900 pounds of VAM were released and vaporized to the environment. Using the EPA lookup tables and default weather conditions, the radius to the endpoint would exceed plant boundaries.  Even though the EPA methodology would allow credit for active mitigation methods, no such credit was taken. \n\nThe PVOH  polymerization reactors are provided with safety systems, including; computer control and monitoring of all process parameters, dilution methanol addition, DEHA reaction stopper injection, cooling water, dual pressure relief systems and a catch tank or vent collection system.

None have had any off-site impact, employee injuries or equipment damage that would qualify as an RMP incident. \n\nThe worst case RMP flammable scenario is the release of the contents of the liquid ethylene storage tank. Ethylene is delivered to the plant in a  railcar or tank truck and stored as a liquid under pressure.  Liquid ethylene storage capacity is administratively controlled to 90% of tank capacity or 237,400 pounds.  Under worst case conditions, a tank failure would release 237,400 pounds of ethylene.  The distance to a 1.0 psi overpressure endpoint would exceed plant boundaries using the EPA lookup tables. \n\nThe alternative case scenario would be the failure of the 2\" ethylene unloading hose.  Using the total contents of the railcar (138,500 lbs) under average weather conditions, an explosion would have an impact to an endpoint with off-site consequences. Even though the EPA methodology would allow credit for active mitigation methods,  no such credit was taken. The safety systems associated with ethylene unloading work include an operator in constant attendance during unloading, two excess flow check valves for shutdown, vapor monitoring and alarm. These and other safety measures would reduce the size of the release and the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nBecause VCM has less explosive energy and is stored in smaller quantities, VCM was not selected for any of the RMP scenarios or hazard assessments.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:\n\nKey to the plants prevention programs are the layers of protection provided at each process.

Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to keep the process within these limits and provide the information and control to properly operate each process in normal, startup/shutdown and emergency conditions.  Instrumentation alarms alert plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process upsets. \n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including critical interlocks that activate automatic shutdowns, pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arresters are in place to safely control upset conditions.  Process areas are covered by fire sensors and flammable vapor sensors, fire sprinklers systems, monitor nozzles, dry chemical extinguishers, etc.  Containment dikes around storage tanks and process areas are curbed to contain small spills and direct them to drains to the plants chemical sewer and the wastewater treatment plant.  \n\nEach process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction and startup. All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made.  At periods not to exceed five years, Operational Plant Hazard reviews are conducted by teams of supervisors, engineers, operators, mechanics and safety professionals.\n\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the production unit, plant and corporate levels.

The emergency response program: \n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER standard. There are at least 16 trained emergency responders in the fire and rescue squad that are divided into shifts and day workers.  Each shift has a fire and rescue squad that is led by the shift safety officer.  In an emergency, the safety officer assumes on-scene command of any incident.  On-site emergency resources include a fire/foam truck, a rescue truck and ambulance.  In addition to these resources, APCI is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can count on pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities.  As a member of the LEPC, APCI regularly stages emergency response drills both in-house and outside with emergency responders from the public and private sector.  LEPC members and other emergency responders regularly tour the facility to familiarize themselves with the plant, its hazardous materials, equipment, layout, personnel and emergency procedures.       \n\n7.
