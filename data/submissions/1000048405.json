Some of neoprene's end uses are: adhesives and sealant, power transmission belts and hoses for automobiles, and wire and cable jacketing.\r\n\r\nThis site uses the following chemicals listed under the RMP regulation: \r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\n- Chlorine\r\n- Nitrogen Tetroxide (Louisiana's list)\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\n- 1,3-Butadiene\r\n- Pentane\r\n\r\nThe production areas covered at this site were divided in to four processes per guidance given by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality during their March 2004 RMP inspection.  The first process is the portion of the neoprene process which uses nitrogen tetroxide to manufacture DIBN (diisobutylene nitrosate) an inhibitor in the manufacture of neoprene.   The process hazard analysis (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 14-341.  This PHA covers the portion of the neoprene process where nitrogen tetroxide is used.\r\n\r\nThe second process is the chloroprene process, which uses chlorine, pentane and 1,3-butadiene as raw materials.  The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 13-337.  While several PHAs cover this area of the plant, this is the most recent PHA completed for the portion of the process where one of these three chemicals are used and it covers chlorine process equipment.\r\n\r\nThe third process is the chlorine storage facilities.  Chlorine is used as one of the raw materials in the production of chloroprene.  It is received in tank cars and stored in five refrigerated bullets.   The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 13-337.\r\n\r\nThe fourth process is the butadiene railcar unloading facilities.  Butadiene is a raw material used in the manufacture of chloroprene"

The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 11-328.\r\n \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nDPE takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program follows OSHA's Guidelines and is directed toward preventing serious, process-related incidents which might affect plant personnel, off-site communities, the environment, or result in significant property loss or loss of business.  It involves the application of systems and controls to chemical and manufacturing processes in a way that hazards are identified, understood and controlled so that process-related injuries and incidents are prevented.  The process safety management systems include the following items:\r\n\r\n- A thorough understanding of the process technology, including the safe limits of the processes and the proper materials of construction for equipment;\r\n- Proper design and installation of equipment;\r\n- Systematic process hazard reviews to identify and address process hazards;\r\n- Written operating and maintenance procedures;\r\n- Extensive training for all persons who operate or maintain chemical process equipment;\r\n- Mechanical integrity testing and preventive maintenance for early detection of potential equipment problems;\r\n- Mechanical quality assurance programs to ensure that the correct spare parts are installed whenever maintenance is performed;\r\n- Procedures to identify and manage both obvious and subtle changes in technology, equipment, and personnel, that could have an effect on the site's safety and environmental performance;\r\n- Pre-startup safety reviews for newly installed or modified equipment;\r\n- Compliance audits to ensure that process safety management principles, procedures, and regulations are effectiv"

The maximum storage of chlorine tank cars and butadiene is used only rarely and for short periods because of differences between shipments and/or to accommodate supplier's production schedule.\r\n \r\nIn addition to the practices described above, processes are designed to include multiple layers of safeguards.  Examples of these include:\r\n\r\n- Automatic valves for rail cars, which isolate the supply of materials from the rail car in the event of a process upset; \r\n- Computer display and control of process parameters;\r\n- Interlocks to automatically shut down processes for certain process deviations;\r\n- Low concentration chlorine detectors that sound an alarm and provide an alarm signal to the computerized process control system when a leak is detected;\r\n- Emergency scrubber system to prevent emissions from reaching the environment; \r\n- Isolation valves which can be operated remotely from the process control system;\r\n- Deluge systems built into the process to quickly suppress chemical fumes or fires;\r\n- Check valves to prevent cross contamination of chemicals;\r\n- Fire prevention activities like electrical grounding, inerting flammables with nonflammable gases and hot work permitting; and\r\n- Operator surveillance during transfer of hazardous materials from shipping containers.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRecords of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur are kept.
