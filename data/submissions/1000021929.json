In June 2002, the facility underwent an addition of approximately 23,000 square feet, which included a dry produce cooler (1 evaporator), an addition to the north dock (2 evaporators), cold produce cooler (1 evaporator) and meat cooler (1 evaporator).    Castle & Cooke Cold Storage purchased the facility in 2009.  \n\nThe primary business of Castle & Cooke Cold Storage is to provide storage of frozen food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 22,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for storage of frozen food products.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 5 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the CalEMA California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nAdministrative Measures:\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \n\u00c2\u00bf\tIIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nThe Castle & Cooke Cold Storage ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "a refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\nEngineering Measures:\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: an emergency shutdown switch that shuts down the compressors, pumps, and condenser (located outside by the condenser in a breakable glass box), relief valves on all pressure vessels, and continuous ventilation in the engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the past five years (April 2006 - April 2011).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tsave lives;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tminimize and avoid injuries;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tprotect the environment; and\n\u00c2\u00bf\tminimize property damage.\n\nCastle & Cooke Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for th"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \n\nCastle & Cooke Cold Storage personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage Operations Manager.  The Operations Manager will contact the Chief Engineer, Castle & Cooke Safety Director, and Senior Vice President of Engineering to evaluate and ascertain the significance of the leak.  If the ammonia leak is considered minor and/or minimal, the repair will be conducted by the Castle & Cooke refrigeration mechanical staff.  An outside refrigeration contractor may be contracted to further assist in the potential repairs to the equipment pertaining to the ammonia system.  For major ammonia leaks, emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Hazard Review was performed on February 28, 2001, at the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility. The 2001 Hazard Review study was revalidated on April 26, 2006 and again on April 25, 2011.  These studies generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility located in Riverside, California.
