The city is committed to reducing the threat to nearby members of the community. Employees receive training for state certification, on site training and training from local suppliers. Our emergency response program will be coorinated with the Port Arthur Fire Dept. It Includes Procedures for notifying effected neighborhoods and schools. This is carried out thru radio, television and telephone.\n2. Stationary service and regulated substance handled:\nThe primary purpose of the facility is the treatment of drinking water. Chlorine is the only toxic chemical over the threshold limit used at this facility. Chlorine is received in ton cylinders via trucking. This facility has equipment for the safe handling and storage of ton cylinders. The total inventory stored at this facility is 40,000 pounds.\n3. Worst case and alternative release scenario:\nOur worst case scenario would be the rupture of a ton cylinder releasing 2000 lbs. Of liquid chlorine. Our chlorine cylinders are attached to a manifold in series of four.  This means we would have three ton cylinders releasing chlorine gas at a high rate through the ruptured cylinder.  Its estimated that an additional 1380 lbs. Of chlorine gas would escape through the ruptured cylinder before they would freeze up exceeding the recommended withdrawal rate of 460 lbs. per cylinder per day. This would increase our total mass release to 3,380 lbs. Chlorine would be released in a 10 minute time period, our release rate would be 338 pounds per minute, with a toxic end point of .0087mg/l. The affected radius would be 6.7 mles assuming worst case atmospheric conditions. The modling figures are from the chlorine institute pamphlet 74. All liquid leaks will be handled by the Port Arthur Fire Department.\nOur alternative release scenario would be a 1/4\" copper tubing that runs from the ton cylinder to the m"

The affected radius would be 1.2 miles assuming worst case atmospheric conditions. On site trained employees will handle all gas leaks.\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\nAccidental release and prevention from the facility includes inspection of equipment and chlorine cylinders for any malfunctions or abnormal apperances. It also includes an inspection check list when changing cylinders. Specific prevention steps include training of employees, safe handling of cylinders, inspection and schduled maintenance of the system. Inventory of spare parts that are subject to fail are kept on site for immediate use. This facility is inspected by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.(TCEQ)\n5. Five year accident history:None to report.\n\n6. Emergency response program:\nOur emergency response program will be coordinated through the Port Arthur Fire Dept. Ton cylinder repair kits will be kept at the water plant and on the fire departments response truck. Class A incapsulated suits will be kept at both locations. Our written emergency response plan includes specific actions to be taken in the event of a release. \n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\nPlanned changes includes scheduled preventive maintainance, updating equipment when needed and continued training of water plant employees."
