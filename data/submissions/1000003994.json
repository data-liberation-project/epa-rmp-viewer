Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Co-op Country Farmers Elevator Company in Olivia, Minnesota  are strongly committed to\nemployee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our\nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\nsubstances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Olivia Fire Department, which provides\nadditional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank, one 12,000-gallon tank, eight 2 each 1,000-gallon nurse\ntanks, four 1,450-gallon nurse tanks and eleven 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Olivia,\nMinnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is\n53,350 gallons (274,539.1 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest\nsingle storage vessel at our facility contains 78,733.8 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage\ncapacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (78,733.8 pounds) in gas"

We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \nAt Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a rural topography, the maximum distance\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is .7 miles (Figure 2).

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of circle. 4.2\nmiles2 x 3.14 x 75 people = approximately 4156 people within 4.2 mile radius of the site. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1 dia. hole in the anhydrous\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 1.2 miles (Figure 3).

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCo-op Country Farmers Elevator Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that\ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all\nprocesses (Appendix E).\n\nProcess"
