      "SummaryText": "City of Thomasville\nThomasville, NC\n\nExecutive Summary -2004\n\nThe City of Thomasville has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at its wastewater treatment plant located in the City of Thomasville. There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program that was completed in 1997 has been maintained current for the past seven years. The compliance with PSM also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program. Key activities have included:\n\n? An annual review of  all chlorine, PSM and RMP procedures\n? Three Year Refreshed training conducted on January 16, 2004\n? A Process Hazards Analysis conducted in June 9, 2004\n? Self Audits every three years with the last one on June 9, 2004\n? A comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program to schedule inspections and maintenance on key chlorine system equipment\n? An annual review and update of the Emergency Response Plan including periodic drills \n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine.\n\n? The chlorine delivery system at the wastewater plant was upgraded to a full vacuum system in February 1999. This new process has proven to significantly improve chlorine safety by placing most of the cylinder system under vacuum. Any leak will result in air leaking into the system as compared to chlorine escaping the system.\n\n? The chlorine emergency response plan has been upgraded. The services of a professional hazardous material response team have been obtained to response to all chlorine incidences.\n\n? The wastewater treatment plant has reduced inventories to allow chlorine to be stored inside. The storage building will act to contain and significantly reduce the impact of any release. They also improve site security.\n\n? Future projects are planned that will eliminate the use of chlorine for disinfection at the wastewater tre"

The water plant switched to an alternate disinfectant and stopped using chlorine in 20021.\n\nIn addition to Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Thomasville has had an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly with representatives from each function and each site.  The committee's duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. \n\nWithin the Utilities Department, there are monthly safety meetings conducted by each plant. There is a review on an OSHA subject or a discussion on a specific water or wastewater safety issue. \n\nThe Utilities safety program involves the following activities:\n\n? Conducting accident reviews for prevention/minimization; \n? Conducting safety inspections for all facilities;\n? Disseminating safety information to Utilities  staff;\n? Preparing and conducting safety training program including such topics as hazard communication, personal protective equipment, confined space and lockout/tagout;\n? Verifying performance of  training programs;\n? Addressing safety issue referrals;\n? Identifying mandatory regulatory agency-required safety training needs; \n? Recognizing exemplary safety performance\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plants have had a strong safety record with no loss time accident over the past six years. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.\n\nReport by:\n                                                               \nKelly Craver\n\nUtilities Director\nCity of Thomasville, North Carolina"
