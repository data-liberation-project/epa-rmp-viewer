We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented for the handling and use of substances regulated by the EPA RMP, including the following:\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule\n- Our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n- A summary of the results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental releases of substances regulated by the RMP rule\n- Our general accidental release prevention program and specific release prevention steps for the RMP regulated substances\n- A five-year history of accidents associated with substances regulated by the RMP rule\n- Our emergency response program\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sugar Land Plant produces numerous chemical products using a variety of raw materials and processing operations. From these different raw materials and operations, the plant annually produces more than 100 million pounds of specialty chemicals for our customers. Approximately 180 employees work year round to meet the needs of oilfield producers, refiners, and chemical plants. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that the EPA has regulated as either toxic or flammable substances under the RMP rule, in quantities in excess of the applicable threshold amount:\n\nToxics\n    Cyclohexylamine\n    Epichlorohydrin\n    Ethylenediamine\n\nFlammables\n    Trimethylamine\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning effo"

It is worth noting that the RMP definition of a potential worst-case scenario results in an event that is far beyond any reasonable expectation. The alternate release scenarios represent more credible, although still unlikely, events.\n\nThe following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n3.1    Worst-case Release Scenario for Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nOur worst case toxic release scenario is the rupture of a tank truck containing epichlorohydrin while unloading into our storage tank. The tank truck rupture would release 45,000 pounds of epichlorohydrin into a diked containment area with a surface area of 1430 square feet. This worst-case release would only reach offsite endpoints and public receptors within a distance of 0.4 miles from the containment area.\n\n3.2    Alternative Release Scenario(s) for Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nWe have evaluated one alternative release scenario for each of our regulated toxic chemicals. These scenarios are summarized below.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for epichlorohydrin is a break in the transfer piping, resulting in the release of 1500 pounds over a ten-minute period. This release would only reach offsite endpoints and public receptors within a distance of 0.1 miles from the release area. There are no residences within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for cyclohexylamine is a break in the transfer piping, resulting in the release of 1500 pounds over a ten-minute period. This release would only reach o"

This release would only reach offsite endpoints and public receptors within a distance of 0.1 miles from the release area. There are no residences within this distance.\n\n3.3    Worst-case Release Scenario for Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nOur worst-case flammable release scenario is the rupture of a tank storing an aqueous solution of trimethylamine, which would result in the release of 55,000 pounds of trimethylamine. A subsequent vapor cloud explosion of the trimethylamine would result in a 1 psi overpressure at a distance of 0.3 miles from the tank.\n\n3.4    Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario for trimethylamine is a break in the transfer piping, resulting in the release of 1500 pounds in one minute. A subsequent vapor cloud fire would result in a distance to the lower flammability limit of <0.1 miles from the release area. There are no residences within this distance.\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals and to ensure safe operation. The accident prevention programs in place include:\n\n- Process safety information: We have a program in place to ensure that information is available regarding the hazards of the regulated chemicals, the processes which handle these chemicals, and the equipment in the process. This information is used to identify and understand hazards posed by these chemicals and processes.\n\n- Process hazard analysis: Under our procedure for process hazard analysis, we perform detailed hazard analyses to identify hazards, assess the likelihood of those hazards (in"

      "SummaryText": "cluding accidental releases), and to evaluate the consequences of these hazards. Analyses are performed on both new and existing processes. Hazard analyses for regulated chemical storage include a review of material unloading, storage, and transfer operations.\n\n- Operating procedures: We have developed written procedures for the operation of all our processes. These procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved with each covered process. These procedures are reviewed and certified at least annually.  We also have written procedures for safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening of process piping; and control over the entrance into the plant by support personnel.\n\n- Training: Every employee involved in operating a covered process is trained in the written operating procedures. The training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operating procedures, and safe work practices. Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n\n- Mechanical integrity: We have an extensive mechanical integrity program with written procedures to help ensure that our process equipment is inspected and maintained. Employees with mechanical integrity responsibilities are trained to ensure that they can perform their job tasks safely.\n\n- Management of change: We have a written management of change program to ensure that changes to a covered process are adequately reviewed before they are implemented.\n\n- Pre-startup safety review: Similar to management of change, we have a written procedure for the review of new or significantly modified equipment, before that equipment is started up. The review is conducted to confirm that the equipment is properly designed and installed and that the associated procedures are in place and are adequate.\n\n- Incident investigation: When an incident or near miss occurs, we have written procedures for reporting of the inc"

The purpose of these investigations is to determine the cause of the incident or near miss and to identity corrective actions which can help prevent a recurrence.\n\n- Hot work permit: We have a written procedure and permit for hot work operations which are conducted on or near a covered process. The procedure and permit are intended to ensure that the hot work is adequately reviewed before it starts and is monitored during the operation.\n\n- Contractors: We have written procedures and policies regarding our use of contractors in and around covered processes. These procedures are used to confirm that contractor employees are adequately trained, have safe work practices, and have been informed of the potential hazards.\n\n- Employee participation: We encourage all our employees to actively participate in the development and use of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\n- Compliance audits: We have a program in place to evaluate compliance with the RMP rule every three years to verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n- Control of emissions from production operations handling RMP chemicals\n- Vapor return for unloading of RMP chemicals to storage tanks\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to help prevent accidental chemical releases.\n\nIn addition to accidental release prevention, we have also implemented the following release mitigation steps:\n\n- Dikes around chemical storage tanks\n- Foam/water sprinkler systems throughout production buildings\n- Foam systems in flammable product and raw materials warehouses\n- Emergency communication and alarm system\n- Firewater monitors and fire hydrants\n- Fire extinguishers\n- Dedicated firewater system with diesel engine backup\n- Over a million gallons of firewater stored onsite\n- Monitoring of onsite regulated chemic"

During the past five years, our facility has not experienced any accidental releases of EPA RMP covered materials that caused significant onsite impacts (i.e., death, injury, or significant property damage) or offsite impacts (i.e., death, injury, evacuation, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage).\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan. We cooperate closely with the local fire department and participate in the county LEPC organization.\n\nWe have an onsite emergency response team. Team members are trained and properly equipped to respond to a variety of emergency situations, including fires and chemical releases."
