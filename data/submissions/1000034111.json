The majority of the ammonia produced at the Yazoo City facility is used to make nitrogen fertilizers. It is these nitrogen fertilizers that feed the plants that in turn feed and clothe the world's population. In addition to ammonia, chlorine is utilized at the facility as a disinfectant in the plant's potable water and cooling water systems. The regulated substances, as defined by CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine, and flammable gas.\n\n\n\nAmong the many other things that CF brings to its community is a commitment to operate safely. The company recognizes the health concerns of its neighboring community and is committed to responding to those concerns. A safe workplace is a top priority for company management and personnel. CF employees continuously look for ways to operate and maintain the production facilities in a safe manner. CF participates in routine safety training programs and drills. In addition, continuous monitoring and assessment of the plant facilities ensure that all operations are running smoothly and efficiently.\n\n\n\nCF has a close working relationship with local emergency responders, and together we are prepared to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility. To ensure proper emergency preparedness, CF has several teams of employees trained in confined space rescue, hazardous waste operations and other specialties. \n\n\n\nCF's safety and environmental record reflects the company's commitment. We have multiple layers of safety and environmental protection integrated into our daily operations at our plants to protect our employees and the community. The following identifies some primary layers of protection:\n\n\n\n   * Managing risk is something we do on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n   * We have worked for many years to reduce risks at "

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a maintenance turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nCF has a comprehensive training program to inform and educate employees to ensure they are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCF carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment during each operational maintenance turnaround to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, turbines, compressors, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with training in maintenance practices. Futhermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nProposed changes are evaluated for potential impact in the areas of safety, regulatory, etc., before being implemented.

Specific to the facility, there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, personal injury or fatality, and equipment failures.\n\n\n\nThe plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Futhermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\n\n\nCF strives on a daily basis to make its facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  Every employee and contractor will attend numerous safety and/or environmental training meetings annually. CF and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safet"
