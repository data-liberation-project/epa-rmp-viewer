Chlorine is stored at the site in a quantity greater than 2500 pounds, the applicability threshold for the Accidental Release Prevention Rules set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. SAWS designed the Risk Management Program to achieve the following objectives.\n\n1. Reduce the potential of an accidental release of chlorine,\n2. Minimize the impacts should a release occur, and\n3. Comply with the environmental regulations\n4. Comply with the requirements of the Clean Air Act\n\nSAWS takes great pride in observing the most stringent industrial safety precautions in preventing chemical related releases. The latest safety technology and monitoring detection systems are used at the Oliver Ranch Pumping Station. Internal inspections and RMP audits are conducted by SAWS staff to include periodic inspections by Texas Commission of Environmental Quality.\n\nBoth active and passive mitigation systems are incorporated into the operations and maintenance of chemical handling systems at Oliver Ranch Pumping Station. Our goal is to first prevent accidental releases and second defuse the impact of an accidental spillage, fire or explosion if it should occur. A reportable accident release has not occurred at any SAWS sites within the last six years. \n\nLike other water utilities in the state, the Oliver Ranch Pumping Station is required to disinfect water prior to discharge into the drinking water system to ensure disease causing bacteria are reduced to a safe level. Chlorine is widely used disinfectant in the water treatment industry because it\u00bfs effectiveness against a broad spectrum of pathogens. Chlorine has shown itself to be an effective agent against waterborne bacteria, viruses and most protozoan agents.\n\nChlorine shipping containers are designed for safety. U.S. Department of"

      "SummaryText": "Transportation Regulations set the maximum permissible filling density for chlorine containers. Chlorine valves are protected by housing (cylinders). In the event of a fire or temperatures exceeding 158 degrees Fahrenheit, the fusible plugs on chlorine containers melt to relieve pressure. Detectors and alarms are available and operable. An Emergency Response plan is incorporated at this facility that includes emergency chemical release response reporting procedures that include site control emergency actions, release control procedures, post incident evaluation. All personnel handling regulated chemicals at the facility are required to be Texas Commission of Environmental Quality certified operators."
