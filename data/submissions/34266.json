This operation includes manufacturing and filling material into cylinders.  The source gas for operations is manufactured at the facility and placed in cylinders.  Finished product is stored and shipped in cylinders with capacities of 130 pounds to 2 pounds, depending of the size of the cylinder.  The plant operates three shifts, 24-hours a day , 7 days a week.\n\nHydogen fluoride (HF) cylinders are processed and stored in quantities that exceed the established EPA threshold.  Therefore this process is subject to RMP regulations.  HF is used as a raw material in the manufacture of another specialty gas.  The HF process involves two cylinders stored together in the process area dedicated to HF operations.  Each HF cylinder has a capacity of 1330 pounds.  At any given time, one cylinder will be utilized in the manufacturing process, while the second cylinder is stored until the first cylinder is emptied during manufacturing. \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has had only one accident involving the regulated process in the last eleven years.  There were no off-site impacts.  In 1996, during equipment repair, less than one pound of liquid hydrogen fluoride was instantaneously released.  In response to the incident, the facility improved gas management systems and procedures to prevent reoccurrence.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nCompressed gas cylinders are manufactured and mainted to the exact codes and standards of the DOT, NFPA, and CGA.  Cylinder construction is mandated in all aspects including metallurgy, wall thickness, and design pressure.  These codes and standards have been established to insure that compresses gas cylinders are designed to withstand extremes"

      "SummaryText": " of operation and overpressure conditions.  Each cylinder must be tested and requalified every 5 years.  Valves must meet stringent manufacturing standards as well.  In addition to these codes and standards, Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. has internal policies for handling compressed gas cylinders.  Compliance with these standards, codes, and policies significantly reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic failure of a compressed gas cylinder.\n\nIn addition to the integrity of the cylinder and components, a primary element of this facility's prevention program is experienced operators.  Not only are they certified with the knowledge , skills, and abilities to perform their duties safely, they are able to assess and resolve possible abnormalities before they result in a release.  Operators are present at the facility 24-hours a day, 7 days a week. After each cylinder is filled, they are leak checked.  Cylinders are stored with protective caps covering the valve.  The facility is monitored for HF gas at various locations inside and outside the manufacturing area.  The monitoring system has automatic process shutdown capabilities.  The HF cylinder room is exhausted to a scrubber unit dedicated to and designed for emergency releases.\n\nThis facility maintains an emergency response team that has been trained in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 Section Q (6) (iii).  Each member receives refresher training and requalification annually.  Equipment necessary to quickly respond to an incident is kept at the facility, including monitors and an emergency scrubber.  The Longmont Fire Department is invited to walk-throughs and drills to acquaint the staff with the facility.  Contact with the city is made by phone and the public authorities are responsible for alerting area residents and businesses.\n\nUPGRADES\n\nThe facility has upgraded the alarm system and process control systems within the the last three years."
