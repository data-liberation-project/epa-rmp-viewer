The facililty makes it a policy to have a complete combined PPC, SPCC< and SPR on-site at all tlimes as well as copies located at the local fire department and emergency management agency office.  This document is reviewed annually by the safety and environmental representatives or as significant changes need to be made, whichever comes first.  The facility is also involved in the activities of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Having no-onsite emergency response team, the facility works closely with the LEPC  and local responders to assure that the risk to the community and the environment would be minimal should an accidental release occur.  To that end, the facility has taken an active role in developing along with the LEPC an accurate and workable off-site response plan which is reviewed and updated annually.\n\nThe Warren, PA facility is composed of several operations.  The Wire business consists of drawing and plating of ferrous andnon-ferrous wire and rod for the electric, electronic and automotive industries.  The Precious Metal Plating operation conducts precious metal plating of non-ferrous wire pins and contacts, wire and strip materials for the automotive and electronic industries.  The Specialty Metals plant manufactures precious metal plating salts and conducts reclamation operations of precious metasl from the Precious Metal Plating departmetn in Warren.  This portion of the facility also accepts precious metal bearing cyanide wastes from OSI's Towanda, PA facility for gold reclamation (per 25 Pa 266.90(b)).  Finally, the Connector Products operation consists of plastic molding, metal stamping and connector assembly operations plus their support groups within the plant.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance in use at the facility above its RMP threshold quantity.

      "SummaryText": "the Wire drawing operation.  The ammonia is fed through a pipeline system to a dissociator building where it is broken down into its basic hydrogena nd nitrogen components as DA, dissociated ammonia.  This gas is then used to control the atmosphere in the various annealing furnaces located througout the wire drawing process.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered by truck to the ammonia storage tank.  It is a clear, colorless gas with a characteristic, intensely irritating outhouse or urine-like odor.  It is very soluble in water.  Ammonia spills or leaks in the facility will always generate ammonia gas or vapor.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp program.  In the worst-case scenerio, the only passive mitigation in place is a dike located all the way around the storage tank which would contain any liquid ammonia which would escape directly from the tank or vaporizer system.  In the case of the alternative release scenerio, the dike would not be effective as a transfer hose failure would cause the release to be beyond the diked area.  However, the ammonia transporter does use as part of their standard protocol a portable catch basin to contain any minor spillage during transfer.  The tank and piping system also utilize excess flow valves as part of the active mitigation.  The plant is located in a residential and industrial area, and, consequently, was deemed to be in urban surroundings.  It was also specified that the material is liquified under pressure.  In the instance of a worst-case disaster it was assumed that the entire contents of our on-site storage tank would release in 10 minutes.  As layed out in the regulations for worst-case scenarios, the wind speed was assumed to be 1.5 meters/second, the material had a stability class of F and the air temperature was assumed to be 77 degrees F.  This 40,208 lb. release would result in a release rate of 1,020.0 lbs. per minute.  These conditions resulted in an estimat"

The area affected (depending on wind direction) would include much of the City of Warren and portions of the adjacent townships, a number of elementary schools plus the local middle and senior high school, the YMCA, the county jail, the county courthouse, several nursing homes, the local hospital and least one other RMP facility.  The Allegheny River and Conewango Creek are also withing the affected area.\n\nWhen the alternative release scenario was considered, it was assumed that an ammonia transfer hose failed during tank filling.  The release rate was estimated based on standard system conditions during tank filling to be 6550 lbs. per minute.  It was assumed that the release duration would be 5 minutes taking into consideration the immediate action that would be taken by the driver at the time of the hose failure to stop the flow of ammonia from the truck.  RMP*Comp set the wind speed at 3 meters per second, the stability class at D and the air temperature at 77 degrees F.  This alternative release scenario resulted in a total release of 32,750 lbs. with an estimated toxic endpoint of 0.5 miles.  Facilities affected within this area include a residential portion of the City of Warren, an elementary school, the local YMCA, the local community swimming pool and another RMP facility.  The Allegheny River and Conewango Creek are also within the affected area.\n\nAccidntal releases on-site are prevented through diligent efforts to inspect and maintain all chemical storage and transport systems as well as the on-site wastwater treatment plant.  Inspections are performed and documented at a minumum of once per week.  Deficiencies within these systems discovered druing these inspections are given priority by the maintenance department for repair and/or upgrade.

The aisles are kept clear for safe fork truck handling of chemicals to and from storage and production areas.  The production areas of the plant where chemical storage and usage occurs have no drains to storm or sanitary sewers.  A released solution would be transported to the on-site wastewater treatment plant or cleaned up with in-house absorbents and accumulated in our less than 90 accumulation area until proper disposal is arranged.  Wastes from the plating lines are transported to the on-site wastewater treatment plant via waste-specific segregated piping which is located in a trenching sytem designed to act as secondary containment.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system has the appropriate piping and safety measures in-place for receiving tank truck shipments to the outside ammonia storage tank.  The tank is firebox quality steel and is painted reflective white.  It is located on concrete saddles within a concrete containment dike.  The backside of the facility in which the tank is located is surrounded by a chain link fence.  This area is accessible only via security-controlled gates or through the plant.  Plant access is controlled by card access.  For consistency sake, this OSI facility utilizes only one anhydrous ammonia supplier.  During loading of the tank, the driver is required to chock the truck wheels.  He must stay with the truck throughout the unload process and be prepared to stop flow if any leaks should develop.  After pumping starts, the driver's instrucions indicate that he is to check all couplings for leaks and to stop pumping if any leaking is detected.

The tank is also equipped with pressure and temperature gauges, pressure relief valves and a check valve on the ammonia fill line.  This facility has had no accidents or releases involving anhydrous ammonia during the last five years.\n\nOSI - Warren does not have an on-site emergency response team, consequently, we have worked closely with the Warren County LEPC to develop an off-site response plan which covers our anhydrous ammonia as well as all other extremely hazardous substances stored on-site above the threshold planning quantity.  We maintain copies of our PPC, SPCC and SPR plan with our local Emergency Management Agency (EMA) as well as the local fire department.  We can obtain on-site response to an anhydrous ammonia release from either Weavertown Environmental Group or EAP, Inc.  McCutcheon Enterprises, Inc. is the county's contracted emergency response team and would respond to the facility per the EMA's request should a release go off-site.\n\nThe piping from the tank to the dissociators was fully replaced in 2003.  The pressure relief valves are scheduled to be replaced in 2004 and the facility is investigating bringing the process area and perimeter monitoring units back on-line in 2004 to improve the safety of the operation."
