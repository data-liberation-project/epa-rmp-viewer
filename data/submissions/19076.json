We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n-A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.\n-A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases.\n-An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n-A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n-An overview of our emergency response program.\n-An overview of planned changes for continuous safety improvement.\n-The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nOur facility manufactures a variety of specialty organic chemicals from batch processing operations. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  Formaldehyde, Methyl Chloride, Phosphorus Trichloride\nFlammables:  Dimethylamine, Methylamine\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contigency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the publc, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKey Off Site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to lim"

Methyl Chloride is used to produce methyl quats at the facility.  This is the only storage tank for methly chloride and the release is contained within a concrete dike.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and fire fighting equiment.  Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Mapleton School employees and students, Mapleton Christian School employees and students, Hollis Park District employees and patrons, Witco Corporation employees, Caterpillar employees, MG Industries employees, Consolidated Industries employees and the general public and commerce within the affected radius.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point (0.82 mg/l) is 3.2 miles according to EPA's RMP*Comp (TM) model.\n\nWorst-case Scenario-Regulated Flammable Chemicals\nThe worst-case scenario selected is a storage tank rupture that releases the entire tank contents of 149,000 pounds of anhydrous Dimethylamine (DMA).  DMA is used in the production of amine products at the facility.  This is the largest storage tank of Dimethylamine and the release is contained within a concrete dike.  This area is equipped with a deluge system and fire fighting equipment  Potential public receptors include Village of Mapleton residents, Mapleton School employees and students, and Witco Corporation employees.  Assuming the released DMA results in a vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.40 miles according to EPA's RMP* Comp (TM) model.
