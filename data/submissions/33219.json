It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local\r\nrules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the\r\nsafety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use\r\nand the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia\r\nstorage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency\r\nresponse agency.\r\n\r\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage.  We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport\r\ntruck and store it as a liquid in pressurized vessels.  Access to the process is restricted to\r\nauthorized employees and contractors.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be\r\nstored at this facility is 30,000 gallons (water capacity).\r\n\r\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of one 30,000 gallon tank when filled to its\r\nmaximum allowable capacity (85% @ 60 F), resulting in a release of anhydrous ammonia.\r\nThe distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 2.41 miles, based on the dense gas dispersion model\r\nDegadis.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to be 2000\r\nresidents, commercial/industrial areas, recreation areas, churches, shchools, cemeteries, and a\r\nhospital within the distance to endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is failure of a 12 foot"

The contents of the hose are released over a period of ten minutes (23 lbs \r\ntotal).  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 317 feet, based on the dense gas dispersion \r\nmodel Degadis.  This distance extends slightly beyond the facility boundary and there are no\r\nreceptors within the distance to endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local\r\ncodes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained\r\nin accordance with ANSI K-61.1, OSHA 1910.111 and state law.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nWe maintain safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and\r\nequipment designs associated with our anhydrous ammonia storage facilities.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Review\r\nOur Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) team conducts comprehensive studies\r\nand reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled\r\nefficiently.  These activities are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise\r\nin process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the\r\nhazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nWe maintain written operating procedures for operation of the anhydrous ammonia storage\r\nfacility.  These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup,\r\nnormal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\r\nshutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily accessible to operators.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating\r\nprocesses are competent in the operatin"

Process\r\nequipment examined by these checks includes:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems,\r\nrelief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations\r\nare performed by qualified personnel that have been trained in safe maintenance practices.  Any\r\nequipement deficiencies are corrected in a safe an dtimely manner.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nWe conduct compliance audits on a regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under\r\nthe RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are performed at least every 3 years and any\r\ncorrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonbly result in, a \r\ncatastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.
