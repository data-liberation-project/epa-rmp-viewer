Headquartered in Salisbury, Md., the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 14 states.  Twenty processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest U.S. grain companies.  Perdue also manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\nOperations at the Perdue Farms Incorporated Lewiston Complex consists of a poultry processing plant (P-9197), by-products facility, and a vehicle maintanence area.  The operation is located at 3539 Governor's Road, Highway 308 West in Lewiston, North Carolina.  Perdue Farms Incorporated began operations at this facility February 26, 1976.  The facility is located in a rural setting surrounded by farmland and residences which include a public school.  \n\nChemical Management Program\n\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe  working conditions and safe practices.  Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans at each operations facility as a part of an overall chemical ma"

Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Lewiston facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is a policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activities associated with this facility are poultry processing and poultry by-products rendering.  There are two regulated substances present at the facility.  These substances include ammonia (anhydrous) and chlorine.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for product refrigeration and cooling.  Chlorine is used for disinfection of process waters.\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) at the facility is 66,540 pounds while chlorine is present at the facility in a maximum quantity of 30,000 pounds.\n\n Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\nThe EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations were used to  perform the off-site consequence analysis, which follows:\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from chlorine.  In this scenario 12,000 pounds of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. At Class F atmospheric s"

The entire pool is estimated to evaporate after 45 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 0.10 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from any ammonia compressor room.  The scenario involves the release of 1 pound of  toxic liquid,  assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate after 120 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.01 miles.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility maintains a process safety management (PSM) plan in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLewiston maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
