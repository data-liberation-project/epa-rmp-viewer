Central City Cooling has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.

Plant Managers are to be called if not on site for support.  Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately notifying the shift supervisor and maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes CIM Electric to review refrigeration equipment integrity and safety on an ongoing basis and prior to initial or seasonal startup. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. CIM Electric, registered engineers and refrigeration experts review the equipment.\n\n\n\nThere are additional full time employees at this facility in addition to maintenance that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems during operation. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be unusual noise, ammonia odor or equipment vibration. This team activity is the core of the prevention program.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility provides product cooling, and short-term storage for produce.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located in a rural area of Santa Barbara County East of Santa Maria. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Plant Refrigeration System.  The ammonia inventory in this system exceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\n\n\n\nThe process is mostly a stationary system with some portable direct, closed loop mechanical refrigeration system components. The ammonia equipment is located both inside and outside of the building.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.

In addition the Main Plant System is separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate.

The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Central City Cooling is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nKey objectives of Central City Cooling's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information for operators. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n\n\n2) Require the equipment servicing partner provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Central City Cooling. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Maintenance Elements).\n\n\n\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases.

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\n\n\nSecond, all Central City Cooling employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM (CalARP) information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Hazard Review and Training Elements)\n\n\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Central City Cooling's program.\n\n \n\nIf a mechanical change is required and for a change in maintenance contracts, Central City Cooling has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Central City Cooling Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \n\n\n\n7) Verification of Central City Cooling's compliance with the RMP/PSM (CalARP) program.

There were no reportable ammonia releases at this facility during the last 5 years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has trained personnel to implement the Emergency Response/Action Plan developed for this facility for flammables, fire, earthquake, hazardous materials and other emergencies. \n\n\n\nFacility personnel have coordinated with responding outside agencies such as Santa Barbara Fire. The facilities emergency action plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \n\n\n\nThe facility has coordinated with outside parties through the Hazardous Materials Business Plan. Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency. In addition Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\n\n\n\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  The facility has chosen to evacuate during all chemical emergencies. The facility will contact the contractor who can bring all areas (zones) under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency plan is to gain access to the shut-down valves and switches for the equipment with the release.  If the controls or valves are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate. The appropriate shut down switches are identified on the equipment.                              "
