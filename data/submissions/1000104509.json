US Foods Inc safety and environmental policies are administered by the General Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/CALARP/RMP Program.  The facility has its own emergency action plan in effect.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for information the public and local response agencies of a chemical release.  The emergency action plan also includes information on emergency health care.  The facility coordinates ammonia release emergencies with Tracy Fire Station 92.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe U.S. Foods, Inc facility is located at 2301 Chabot Court, Suite 102, Tracy, California.  The primary business of U.S. Foods, Inc is to provide processing and cold storage of frozen food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system with an inventory exceeding the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and cold storage of frozen food products. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe U.S. Foods, Inc ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management re"

The facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that vent to the atmosphere.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the plant in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe US Foods Inc facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency response plan is located in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document with the following objectives:\n\n- to save lives\n\n- to minimize and avoid injuries\n\n- to protect the environment\n\n- to minimize property damage\n\nFacility management maintains committees whose members are designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated as needed.  In case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and contractors and activate the facility's plan to respond to the situation.  If necessary, they will alert the local emergency responders (fire department) for assistance.  The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe U"
