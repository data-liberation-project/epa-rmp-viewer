Facility Policy\n\nSouth Central Coop is a full service farm supply company with the greatest risk of release coming from our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Warren County LEPC, and other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity of this facility is to store and distribute anhydrous ammonia in storage and nurse tanks, for the application and fertilization of agronomic crops.\n\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with provision fo \"Safety Requiremetns for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111. \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21 - Chapter 42-Rule 43.6 (200).  \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The OSHA Standard is referenced in the registration form Section 8.3b.  Additional accidental release preventions measures we utilize range from employee training to equipment maintenance.  We have excess flow valves and pressure relief valves on our ammonia system.  We also have gauges to tell us when these tanks are full to prevent the over filling of these tanks which in turn create an accidental release.\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nWe had an accidental release of ammonia August 19, 2010. \n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Action Plan\n\nOur Emergency Response Program consists of a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA St"

We also follow the Iowa Fertilizer Rule Standards and provide state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  We will notify the local authorities as well as the LEPC if a release occurs.  Our role as the company will be to secure the area until local authorities arrive and assist them in any way possible.\n\n\n\n6.  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.   We have implemented requirements such as locking storage tanks and placing vehicle barriers around the storage tanks and plumbing.  We also have tested the underground pipe system August 7, 2008. We have replaced some of our single braided flex piping with double braided.  We intend to replace all single braid flex lines with double braid. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time."
