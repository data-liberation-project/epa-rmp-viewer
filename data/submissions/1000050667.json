      "SummaryText": "Evansville's water filtration plant utilizes chlorine as its primary means of disinfecting the city's drinking water. Chlorine, although essential for protection of public health, is classified as a hazardous chemical. Facilities like Evansville's, which use, manufacture or store hazardous chemicals at or above various threshold quantities must meet various Federal requirements. The Risk Management Program (40 CFR Parts 9 & 68) is an example on one such requirement. The goal of this Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation is to protect the public and environment by minimizing the effects of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate and address potential risks to the public and environment from the use of chlorine, the filtration plant has formulated, conducted and maintains operations, maintenance, and training procudures, in addition to hazard analysis. All of these procedures and analysis provide mitigation for a \"worst case scenerio\" release. Such a release is defined by the regulation as an incident involving realease of gaseous chlorine from a one ton storage container in gaseous form over a 10 minute period. With Class F atmospheric stability, and a windspeed of 1.5 m/sec the maximum sistance of 1.7 miles is obtained using ALOHA R modeling, corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/liter. The alternative release scenerio for chlorine involves the rupture disk/relief valve not functioning properly. This scenerio involves the release of 171 pounds of chlotine in a gaseous form over a 10 minute period. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 1.5 m/sec. the maximum distance obtained is 0.3 miles corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\n\n\nTo address this issue, the Evansville Water and Sewer Utility(EWSU) utilizes proper safety equipment, preventative maintenance procedures and comprehensive employee training to minimize the impact of potential chlorine equipment. The filtration p"

      "SummaryText": "lant's inventory of chlorine is stored in a fire resistive room which also contains all chlorine equipment. Additional safety mechanisms such as pressure relief valves, excess flow devices, manual and automatic shutoffs and emergency power supply are also incorporated into the chlorine process controls. Routine maintenance and inspections ensure the proper operation of this equipment and operations are performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Filtration plant employees receive annual training on chlorine safety. In addition, maintenance employees are given hand-on training in responding to minor chlorine leaks. In more serious situations, local chemical companies have familiarized themselves with the Evansville system and have agreed to respond with approporiate emergency response teams and equipment. These teams would work with EWSU officials to notify local emergency response agencies and the public when necessary.\n\n\n\nSafety will remain the number one priority of the Evansville Water & Sewer Utility. By working together, we will continue to provide the public, our employees, and the environment with the technology, training, and commitment to minimize or prevent the accidental release of chlorine from the Evansville Water Filtration Plant."
