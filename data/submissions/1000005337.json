      "SummaryText": "Versacold USA Inc. Hatfield, PA\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE EPA RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN \n\nVersacold USA Inc. Management has implemented the requirements of the Risk Management Plan at this location in order to operate this facility in accordance with regulations and support of best industry standards.  The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Employee Emergency Action and Fire Prevention Plan.  Along with the emergency procedures and training, a plan is coordinated with local emergency responders to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, a fire or other emergency situation.  Versacold USA Inc. Hatfield provides emergency response training for employees through the use of specialists in the industry that are authorized to train.  Versacold USA Inc. Hatfield believes it is important that employees that participate in emergency response situations are adequately trained in handling emergency situations with anhydrous ammonia systems.  This specialized HAZMAT training follows the guidelines of federal, state and local regulatory agencies.\n\nThe management believes that cooperative emergency response training must include company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agency people in order to provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all employees are trained to cooperate with other support personnel as directed by the Emergency Response Incident Commander.                                                                                                                                                             \nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at Versacold USA Inc. Hatfield, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state regulatory agency safety"

Hatfield is a refrigerated warehousing and distribution facility. The large majorities of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrigeration systems in this facility contain approximately 31,286 pounds of ammonia inventory for this process.  Two refrigeration systems operate in individual cold storage warehouses on the property.  Plant 2 has an ammonia charge of approximately 13,734 pounds and Plant 3 has an ammonia charge of approximately 17,552.\n\n\nVersacold USA Inc. is committed to safe management and operation of the closed Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Maintenance employees are trained to observe operational procedures designed to be as fail-safe as possible to prevent accidental release of ammonia at any time.  Should any accidental release occur, all refrigeration employees are certified Emergency Hazardous Material Responders and are required to observe safe emergency response procedures.  They are trained to work in conjunction with the local Emergency Planning Commission to minimize the impact of any accidental releases.\n\nAs part of Versacold USA Inc. safety programs, we have adopted the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan as required and is an integral part of our base safety manual.  The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and"
