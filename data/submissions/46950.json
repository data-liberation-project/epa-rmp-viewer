      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program (RMP) Executive Summary\nCF Industries, Inc. - Devils Lake Terminal\n\nAbout CF Industries, Inc.\nCF Industries is one of North America's largest interregional cooperatives, owned by and serving eight regional cooperatives.  Through its Members, the Company's nitrogen, phosphate and potash fertilizer products reach over a million farmers and ranchers in 48 states and two Canadian provinces.  CF Industries' fertilizer distribution system includes a network of 21 Company-owned anhydrous ammonia storage facilities.\n\nIt is the policy of CF Industries to conduct its business and operate its facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment, and the health and safety of its employees.  This protection extends to neighbors of the Terminal.  Additionally, we are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations and the Company will promote environmental concern and education among our employees and with the communities in which we operate.  CF Industries is equally committed to protecting the safety and health of its employees, and will take all practical steps to eliminate or reduce the exposure of employees to conditions adversely affecting their safety or health while on the job, and encourages off-the-job employee safety and health awareness as well.  The Company will not hesitate to go beyond legal requirements if, in its prudent judgment, a higher level of performance is in order.  The commitment to excellence regarding Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) issues is supported in total by Senior Management of CF Industries.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nOne of the Company's distribution facilities is the Devils Lake Terminal, located approximately 90 miles west of Grand Forks.  CF Industries purchased the terminal in June 2003.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance at the Devils Lake Terminal.  The Terminal receives ammonia by rail and distributes it into tank trucks. The Term"

An extensive EHS program assures compliance with applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations.\n\nCF Industries' anhydrous ammonia is used primarily as a fertilizer.  Ammonia is a source of nitrogen that is essential for plant growth.  It is classified by the Department of Transportation as a non-flammable, compressed gas.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCF Industries' Layers of Protection\nCF Industries has implemented a comprehensive program at its distribution facilities designed to safeguard the environment, its workers and the surrounding communities.  The layers of protection are the numerous prevention mechanisms implemented at the Company's fertilizer storage facilities to help manage the risks inherent in handling anhydrous ammonia.  The key safety features are listed below.\n\n?  The facility conducts comprehensive reviews to ensure that hazards associated with CF Industries' processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  These reviews are conducted in accordance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  One of these reviews is a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is designed to identify all failure scenarios that could lead to a significant exposure of ammonia to workers, the public, or the environment.  The review is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated every five years.  Any findings related to the PHA are addressed in a timely manner. \n?  A flare burns ammonia vapor before it can be released to the atmosphere.  This is performed when the ammonia vapor from the truck unhooking procedure is released into the flare vessel.\n?  The ammonia storage system is protected by pressure relief valves and compressors which operate automatically.\n?  An emergency shutdown button is located in the control r"

Through CF Industries' PSM program, all covered equipment used at the facility undergoes routine performance tests and maintenance.  This PSM program forms the foundation for the RMP prevention program.\n? Operating temperatures and pressures, and other parameters, are monitored during the loading/unloading process.  Such monitoring allows Terminal personnel to quickly respond to operational problems in their early stage; thereby preventing releases of ammonia to the environment.\n?  Every truck which loads anhydrous ammonia at the facility is inspected by facility personnel.  Any truck that fails the inspection is not permitted to remove anhydrous ammonia from the facility.\n?  Another essential element of our Layers of Protection is employee training and continuing education.  Every operating person receives extensive Hazardous Materials Safety training with eight hours of refresher training each year.  They also receive documented training covering 48 specific topics.\n?  CF Industries maintains industrial hygiene and medical programs that meet or exceed standards of good professional practice.\n?  CF Industries also works extensively with the local emergency  and fire responders through simulation training and drills.  The Company believes it is important that first responders are prepared to deal with any emergency on site.\n?  CF Industries routinely carries out highly documented maintenance checks on its process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n?  CF Industries maintains and enforces formal procedures and policies on environmental protection, safety awareness, facility design and operation, and contractor compliance that, in many cases, go beyond legal and regulatory requirements.

      "SummaryText": "al EHS audit program is designed to make the Devils Lake Terminal the best in the industry.  In addition, the Terminal maintains written operating procedures which describe what tasks a process operator must perform, define safe operating parameters that must be maintained, and set safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  The facility is assessed for compliance with federal, state and local regulations every year.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nCF Industries has developed Emergency Manuals for all of its distribution facilities, including the Devils Lake Terminal.  Copies of the Devils Lake Emergency Manual are kept at the facility and the Company's corporate headquarters.  Copies are sent to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the local Fire Departmenst.  The Manual includes all aspects of emergency response including personnel roles and responsibilities, lines of authority, communication, pre-emergency planning, emergency recognition and prevention, emergency alerting and response procedures, site evacuation routes, site security, decontamination, emergency response equipment, medical treatment and first aid services, and post-emergency activities and training.  The Manual is reviewed annually with the first responders.  In addition, CF Industries trains its employees annually on the use of this Manual.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Devils Lake Terminal was calculated using the methodology included in the EPA's RMP Off-Site Consequence Guidance.  This methodology was applied to a pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage tank (bullet) and a pressurized ammonia railcar.  Applying the RMP's mandated assumptions, the pressurized railcar resulted in the largest downwind impact.  Thus, the worst-case release scenario, which is highly unlikely, involves a complete release of the volume of a pressurized railcar to the atmosphere.

A USEPA-approved model was used to determine the maximum downwind distance the ammonia release could impact the general public and/or the environment.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nIn addition to the worst-case scenario, the RMP rule also requires the submittal of an alternative release scenario, or more realistic release scenario for each covered process.  For the Devils Lake Terminal, the anhydrous ammonia alternative release scenario involves a release of ammonia from a 2 inch diameter unloading hose.  The excess flow valve is assumed to close, limiting the release duration to 5 seconds.  No active mitigation measures were considered in evaluating a release under this scenario.\n\nThe above-described release was chosen because it represents the most common type of release, as determined from an evaluation of all recent releases from this terminal.  CF Industries believes this release represents the most probable type of release which could occur at the Devils Lake Terminal, which has off-site impacts to the general public and/or the environment.  Under average weather conditions of low/moderate wind speed and neutral atmospheric dispersion, the release will cause off-site impacts. A USEPA-approved model was used to perform the off-site consequence analysis.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History \nThere has never been a catastrophic failure of a refrigerated storage tank at any of the 21 CF Industries-owned ammonia storage and distribution facilities.  Additionally, CF Industries' Devils Lake Terminal has had no releases in the last five years that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCF Industries will continue to coordinate information and training with emergency responders.
