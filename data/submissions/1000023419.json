      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\r\nWhite Energy Hereford, LLC\r\n\r\nThis RMP resubmission is being submitted to make administrative corrections to the RMP and to remove hydrochloric acid from the RMP, as the hydrochloric acid stored onsite does not meet the 37% concentration requirement for RMP applicability.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nWhite Energy Hereford, LLC (WE Hereford) has an ongoing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, personnel training on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.  WE Hereford has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan, Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan, Facility Response Plan, and Emergency Response Action Plan.  Most of the listed Plans have a minimum of annual training requirements to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  New employees are required to read the Plans listed above and undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.  WE Hereford's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nWE Hereford is located in Hereford, Deaf Smith County, Texas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and flammable mixture, natural gasoline(denaturant).\r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\r\nWorst Case Scenarios:\r\n1.\tAnhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia i"

      "SummaryText": "s stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an 18,000 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, 97,200 pounds, creating a toxic vapor cloud.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are kept in facility records.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes; the typical chain link fence used to enclose the ammonia tank would not prevent migration of a release, but would help to prevent unauthorized access to the tank and protection against vehicle collisions.  Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6.  No environmental receptors are within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.\tFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off-site. Denaturant is stored in a 188,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine initial RMP applicability, this worst case MSDS will continue to be reflected in this RMP.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation on file at the facility.  The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 1,052,800 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, only 357,952 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112(r).   RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are kept in facility records.   Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6 and the facility's knowledge of nearby residence"

      "SummaryText": "s.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\r\n\r\nAlternate Scenarios:\r\n1.\tAnhydrous Ammonia:  The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 10,000 pounds due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are kept in facility records.  Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6 and the facility's knowledge of nearby residences.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.\tFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations, therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to a lined containment pond.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in placewould not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint,the model results are kept in facility records. Of the 42,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 14,280 p"

Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6 and the facility's knowledge of nearby residences.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant. \r\n\r\nIn some cases the denaturant stored onsite will only carry a NFPA 3 rating, therefore classifying the flammable mixture as a Program 2 substance.  WE Hereford has listed the flammable mixture as Program 3 in the RMP as a worst case scenario.  Anhydrous ammonia qualifies as a Program 3 substance.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nWE Energy Hereford has not had an accident relating to any of the covered programs since the start-up of facility operations.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nWE Hereford has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including the Health and Safety Plan and Facility Response Plan.  WE Hereford also has an Emergency Response Action Plan that details evacuation and response procedures for spills and releases, fire, etc.  The Plans listed in this section have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations, as necessary.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nWE Hereford will continue to provide training programs to ensure the safety of employees and contractors."
