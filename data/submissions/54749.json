      "SummaryText": "Brazos River Authority\nClute/Richwood Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n\nThe Clute/Richwood Wastewater Treatment Facility is a contact stabilization plant, which is an activated sludge process. Activated sludge is the sediment from sewage that has been agitated in the presence of oxygen. This sediment of A?activated sludgeA? contains living organisms that feed on sewage and require oxygen to live. In general, the facility consists of pretreatment units, secondary treatment, secondary clarifier, chlorination facilities and sludge handling facilities.\n\nIn this treatment system, submersible pumps lift the raw wastewater and then pass it through an influent channel with a mechanical bar screen and grit removal facilities. Following grit removal, the wastewater flows to the contact stabilization tank for contact aeration and stabilization. The mixture of the wastewater and sludge is agitated over time in the presence of atmospheric oxygen in the contact zone and re-aeration zone. The stabilized wastewater then settles in the clarifier. The process further digests sludge from the clarifier in the sludge digester. The clarified wastewater then flows into the chlorine tank for disinfection and discharge to the East Union Bayou.\n\nCHLORINE:\n\nThe 1-ton chlorine containers are stored in chemical storage building with forced air ventilation.  The containers are connected to the main header via whip lines.  The main header goes directly into pressure regulators/switchover mechanisms whereby the system goes under vacuum.  The room has a chlorine gas detection alarm system to warn of a chlorine gas leak as well as an automatic activation water curtain.  A ventilation system draws fresh air in from the floor and forces gases into the water curtain before leaving the structure.\n\nBy state permit, the facility is required to disinfect the discharge effluent with chlorine to attain a level of no less than 1 ppm after a 20-minute contact time. The purpose of this process is to prevent pathogen"

      "SummaryText": "s from exiting the facility and being discharged into the surface waters of the state. Further, the permit requires a de-chlorination process so that the residual chlorine does not exceed 0.09 ppm. De-chlorination uses sodium thiosulfate as a safe and environmentally friendly process.\n\n \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAuthority policies include the need for a written emergency action plan, exercises and reviews of the plan, emergency response training for facility personnel, and coordination with local responders.  In addition, monthly safety inspections are conducted by the Authority's Safety Training Officer.  Risk management consultants from our insurance company are used as resources.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe chemical storage area is enclosed and equipped with a water curtain designed to convert a gaseous release to a liquid release producing hydrochloric acid that is contained inside the chemical building. Plant personnel are trained to handle chemical containers in such a manner as to prevent leaks or spills while connecting or disconnecting containers.  Personnel are also trained to shut down the system by closing the container valve in the event of an emergency or anticipated emergency. \n\nWhile the worst-case release scenario and alternate release scenarios require an offsite impact, the models do not take into account the unique terrain features that surround the facility. Uniquely, this facility has numerous flood control channels surrounding it, which would tend to capture a chlorine release as the chemical is heavier than air. On the east side is the Velasco Flood Control Channel Number 13, which is approximately 12 feet deep with a 30-foot wide bottom, side slopes of 1.5 to 1.0 and an upper prismoidal opening of 66 feet from high bank to the opposite high bank. The north side of the facility is sparsely populated; the Velasco Flood Control Channel Number 13 makes a 900 bend approximately 600 feet north "

The facility drains into an intermittent channel approximately eight feet deep and contiguous with both the western boundary and the six-foot high raised ballast of the Northern Pacific mainline railroad. To the south is a heavily wooded section with another Velasco Flood Control Channel of the same dimensions as previously described. Both of the Velasco Flood Control Channels have a common confluence and are at approximate elevation 1.0. They drain east to a pump station 1.5 miles in the opposite direction from the city through grazing land for livestock and ends at a bottom elevation of approximately minus six feet.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere were no reportable accidental releases of chlorine during the last five years. \n\n \nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facilityA?s emergency response program requires the facility personnel to dial 911 to declare a chlorine emergency and to request local emergency response assistance. If possible, the facility operators may attempt to abate, contain and control the leak without compromising their safety. The local emergency first responders will respond to the immediate emergency and stabilize the situation if it is beyond the capabilities of the facility personnel. Facility personnel who are not injured will remain engaged throughout the incident with local emergency first responders to provide technical assistance and expertise regarding facility operations. They will also assist with mitigation, remediation and disposal of contaminants following incident stabilization.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges made following the last safety review included the addition of a chlorine leak detector and an automatically activated water curtain, which will reduce the migration of chlorine gas from the containment building to the outside atmosphere as well as new SCBAs and new operating procedures.\n\nThere are no planned safety changes for Clute/Richwood Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n"
