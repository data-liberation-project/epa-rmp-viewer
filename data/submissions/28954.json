This RMP addresses the Butane Blending System at Motiva Enterprises LLC-Greensboro Terminal.  The Greensboro Terminal operates as a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility.  This RMP addresses the butane blending system at the facility.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention an Response Policies\n\nThe Greensboro Terminal has processes in place to comply with applicable federal, state and local regulations and laws.  If a release were to occur Terminal Personnel have been trained on emergency response procedures.  It is the facility\u00bfs policy to notify the Greensboro Fire Department as well as the Guilford County LEPC in the event of a release per procedures outlined in the facility\u00bfs Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Greensboro Terminal is located at 101 South Chimney Rock Road in Greensboro, North Carolina.  The Terminal operates as a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility, distributing petroleum products including gasoline and diesel.  \n\nThe Butane Blending System consists of one 89,715-gallon butane storage tank, associated piping, and a butane injection skid.  Butane is offloaded from tanker trucks into the butane storage tank and injected into the gasoline shipping lines.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis  \n\nAs required by the regulation, a worst case release scenario for the Butane Blending System at the Greensboro Terminal was determined to be a release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion of the 89,715-gallon butane storage tank when filled to capacity (92.4% at 60 degrees Fahrenheit).  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) would extend 0.5 miles and would include residential and industrial public receptors.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario for the Butane Blending System at the Greensboro Termi"

The resulting distance the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) would extend 0.02 miles and would include industrial public receptors.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release/Chemical Specific Prevention Program Steps\n\nThe Greensboro Terminal has procedures and processes in place to comply with the requirements set forth in the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) Risk Management Program.  In addition, the Greensboro Terminal is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws, and manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nTo date, the Greensboro Terminal has never had an accident associated with the butane blending system (new system).  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program for the Greensboro Terminal is documented in the Facility\u00bfs Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The emergency response plan outlines the processes and procedures in place to mitigate an emergency situation by setting up effective communications, establishing a management plan, providing necessary resources, and facilitating coordination with local, state and federal emergency response agencies. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Greensboro Terminal Butane Blending System, Terminal Personnel have been trained to contact the Greensboro Fire Department for response assistance.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the Fire Department and the Guilford County LEPC.  The Greensboro Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM Training Session for the Butane Blending System."
