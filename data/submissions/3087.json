The elements of this RMP, dealing with the safe handling and management of chemicals, have been in place and in practice at the plant for many years.\n\n\nThe RMP Submit software does not provide the flexibility to input a series of dates relative to completion of the program elements.  Because Process Hazards Analyses and other tasks outlined in the plan generally occur over several days,  the program default value of the first day of the month was selected to reflect completion of the task within the month and year indicated by the inputted date. \n\n\nPolicies and procedures regarding the prevention of accidental releases, as well as those describing how we respond to accidental releases and other types of potential emergencies, are well established at the plant.  These are described in detail in the Plant Emergency Control Plan. \n\n\nThe chemical substances handled at the plant addressed in this RMP (i.e. \"Regulated Substances\") are Chlorine and Hydrazine.  Velsicol has no flammable chemicals covered by the rule.  The areas in the plant where these two chemicals are handled in the largest quantities (i.e\"Covered Processes\"as defined in 40 CFR 68.3) are:\n\n1.  One or two 90 ton Chlorine railcars located at the chlorine unloading area on the east (Warford St.) side of the plant and the associated 9 ton chlorine storage tanks.\n2.  One 4500 gallon storage tank of Hydrazine adjacent to the chlorine unloading area in the central part of the plant.\n\nFor these specific regulated substances,  the rule requires that a single worst-case release scenario analysis be prepared.  It further requires preparation of an alternative release scenario for each of these substances.\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for purposes of this RMP is described as an instantan"

Active mitigation systems such as automatic valve closures or alarm systems are not to be considered, in accordance with the RMP regulations, when constructing the hypothetical worst-case release scenario.  There were no passive mitigiation systems around the chlorine storage locations that were considered in the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe \"alternative release scenarios\" prepared and made a part of the RMP are as follows.  For chlorine, the scenario is a hole in a transfer line resulting in a release of 7.7 lbs/minute for a duration of 15 minutes.  For hydrazine, it is a hole in a transfer line resulting in a release of 30 lbs./minute onto the ground for a duration of ten minutes.\n\nA comprehensive program described in a number of manuals and procedures designed to prevent accidental releases of any chemicals used at the plant has been in place for many years and includes:\n\n1.  Process safety information located throughout the plant;\n2.  Process hazard reviews conducted on all manufacturing processes;\n3.  Detailed written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safe operation of each process;\n4.  Regular employee training on process operating procedures, safety, emergency operation/shutdown, and chemical hazard communication;\n5.   Maintaining mechanical integrity of process equipment through regular inspection, testing and preventive maintenance;\n6.  Management of changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures to insure continued safe operation:\n7.  Pre-start up safety reviews for new or modified processes;\n8.  Periodic compliance reviews to evaluate whether procedures and practices to prevent accidental releases are adequate and are being followed;\n9.

This plan specifies actions to be taken in response to any release.  The plan includes procedures for making notifications to parties outside the plant and is fully coordinated with the local Emergency Management Agency's plan.\n\nThe plant continuously strives to improve the safety of its operations through its Responsible Care Leadership Team which meets on a regular basis."
