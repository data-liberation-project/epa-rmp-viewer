      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nHeber has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan for the Heber 1 facility to address the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, \u00a72735-2785), the EPA Risk Management Program (40CFR68), OSHA Process Safety Management Program (29CFR1910.119) and Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management (California Code of Regulations, Title 8, \u00a75189). Heber is extremely diligent in the handling of the regulated substance isopentane and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Heber staff are highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using isopentane for geothermal power production.\nHeber has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the isopentane systems. Heber\u0092s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of isopentane.\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nHeber\u0092s geothermal power production facility is fueled by hot geothermal brine from the Heber Geothermal Reservoir located in Heber, California, approximately 1.5 miles south of the town of Heber. The area around the facility consists of agricultural land and a single residence.\nThe power is produced in a binary Rankine cycle. In that cycle, also known as an Ormat Energy Converter (OEC), energy is transferred from the hot geothermal brine to an isopentane working fluid, referred to as motive fluid, in shell and tube heat exchangers.  The motive fluid is vaporized in the heat exchangers which drives turbines that are coupled to generators to produce electric power.  The motive fluid exiting the turbines is condensed in either water-coo"

The electric power generated by this cycle is then sold to contracted off-takers. \nThere are a total of four OECs in the facility; OEC 12 \u0096 commissioned in 2008, OEC 14 commissioned in 2018   and a new OEC 1&2 I3LU \u0096 to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2023.  Another unit, OEC 11 \u0096 commissioned in 2005, is currently out of service and is in the process of being retrofitted to enable operation with the same pumped brine systems that supply the other OECs.  A smaller OEC, OEC 13 has been decommissioned.  The four OECs are grouped into two processes due to their relative locations and interconnectivity.  Process 1 consists of OEC 12, 14 and two storage tanks.  Process 2 consists of OEC 1&2 and a third storage tank.  The maximum intended inventory of isopentane in the two processes is 983,164 lbs.  This includes the quantity charged to all four OECs plus some residual quantity kept in storage.  The intent is to minimize the amount kept in storage to ensure adequate capacity for process evacuation during maintenance activity.\nThe site is currently operated by Heber staff and is staffed 24 hrs a day. The facility employs approximately 32 personnel.\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: The worst-case release scenario is defined by the release of the contents of the OEC 2 Level 3 vaporizer.  A similar release from the OEC 14 Level 2 vaporizer or the most northern of the storage tanks (in a full condition) would result in the same impact zone.  The worst-case release can potentially impact offsite public receptors in a local residence and on adjacent agricultural land.  The most stringent prevention program requirements are applied at Heber 1.  \nAlternate Release Scenarios Results Summary\nScenario Description: An alternate release scenario was modeled as we"

Public receptors can also potentially be impacted by this release. \nThe scenarios are also displayed in the graphic file attached to the RMP eSubmit document.\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the use of isopentane has inherent potential risks, and worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios can potentially reach public receptors; Heber has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make these scenarios improbable. \nThere are numerous facility safeguards that serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an isopentane release, which include: \n\u0095\tAutomatic / Manual Shutdown Systems that enable remote isolation and depressurization of the OECs and electrical isolation.\n\u0095\tAdequately Designed Pressure Relief System to provide a fail-safe backup to prevent over-pressurization\n\u0095\tPerimeter Fire Water Monitors and Storage Tank Deluge Systems to enable equipment cooling and prevent premature component failure.\n\u0095\tFlame and gas detection monitoring which interlocks with plant automatic shutdown systems and provides local audible and visual alarms.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of the accidental release prevention programs, prevention program elements are documented and implemented by the Heber facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of isopentane. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nEach of the facility\u0092s two processes exceeds the 10,000 lb regulatory threshold quantity of isopentane.  As a result, both processes are subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, OSHA PSM and Cal/OSHA PSM.\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include: \n\u0095\tProcess Safety Information\n\u0095\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u0095\tOperating Procedures\n\u0095\tTraining\n\u0095\tMechanical Integrity\n\u0095\tManagement of Change\n\u0095\tPre-Startup Safety Review\n\u0095\tCompliance Audits \n\u0095\tIncident Investigation \n\u0095\tEmployee Participation \n\u0095\tHot Work"

Employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency. Heber coordinates with local Fire Department and First Responders. Heber has filed a Hazardous Materials Business Plan (which contains the Emergency Response Plan) to help coordinate with local responders.\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 3220 is in place.\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS INFORMATION\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, 2745.7(q); the following external events analysis information were reviewed and are submitted with the CalARP documentation: \n\u0095\tThe types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2. \no\tDuring the PHA  a broad list of external events was considered by the Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of isopentane were addressed. The External Events that were considered are detailed within the PHA worksheets, which are included in the CalARP document.\n\u0095\tA seismic assessment of piping and equipment was performed in December 2018 and documented in a February 2019 report.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations made during the revalidation of the PHA for OEC 12&14, development of the new PHA for OEC 1&2 and the performance of the Triennial Compliance Audit in 2022.  Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed by December 2023."
