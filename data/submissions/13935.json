The resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation and operation of our process containing flammable mixtures demonstrate this commitment.\n\nFacility Description and Substance Handled\nThe  McMullen Gas Plant is located at 99 South FM Road, Tilden, TX  78072.  The McMullen Gas Plant operates one Program Level 3 process. This process receives, handles, and stores a regulated flammable mixture. The gas plant receives natural gas via pipelines, separates out liquids, and discharges the natural gas back into the transmission pipelines.  The liquids are stored onsite until loaded onto tank trucks and transported offsite.\n\nThe McMullen Gas Plant does not use any regulated toxic chemicals.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nA worst-case scenario is defined as the catastrophic release of the largest inventory of the regulated substance from a single vessel.  For regulated flammable mixtures that are normally liquids at ambient temperature, the release is an instantaneous release of the entire inventory, which forms a liquid pool.  For liquids at temperatures below their atmospheric boiling point, the volatilization rate shall be calculated at the following conditions:\n\n7 Highest daily maximum temperature occurring in the past three years,\n7 The  temperature of the substance in the vessel\n7 The concentration of the substance if the liquid spilled is a mixture or solution.\n\nAssume that the quantity, which becomes vapor in the first ten (10) minutes, is reported as the quantity released.\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that none of the many process controls and safety systems are operational.  The process controls and safety systems at the McMullen"

The distance for the worst-case release scenario was calculated using the Baker-Strehlow method.  The distance for the alternative release scenario was determined using the look-up tables in the EPA Guidance Document.\n\nThe worst-case release is a release of the entire contents of Stabilized Product Storage Tank (43,000 lbs.).  The distance to the 1 psi endpoint is 570 feet.  This release scenario does have an offsite impact.  One small office building is impacted.  No other public receptors are impacted.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nThe more realistic alternative flammable release scenario is a complete seal failure on the Gasoline Loading Pump located outside the Stabilized Product Storage Tank dike.  The release is assumed to continue for 1 minute.  Approximately 135 lbs. of stabilized product are released.  The release goes offsite.  The distance to the 1-psi endpoint is 149 ft.  This release scenario impacts no members of the public, no public receptors, and no environmental receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Specific Steps\nThe  McMullen Gas Plant has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The program addresses the flammable hydrocarbon handling that is covered by the EPA's RMP rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program involves process design, equipment design, and construction to meet all applicable codes and standards.  In addition, a number of safety systems, such as process controls, warning alarms, and operational controls are in place to prevent a release from occurring.\n\nThe McMullen Gas Plant has written"

This documentation includes information on the hazards of flammable hydrocarbons, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of the accidental release prevention program has been monitored by Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs), which have been performed for the flammable hydrocarbon process.  PHAs provide a method for understanding potential hazardous events, the means by which they occur and what actions are likely to prevent them from occurring.  A team approach is used on the PHAs to evaluate the potential consequences of failures in the flammable hydrocarbon process.  The safeguards in place for each hazard are recorded and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Recommendations are then made to improve safety where the existing safeguards were not considered adequate by the PHA team.  A PHA of the flammable hydrocarbon process was completed in 1994 and will be updated on a 5-year cycle.\n\nThe basis for proper and safe operation of the flammable hydrocarbon system is provided by written operating procedures.  These procedures define the operating limits, identify safety and health considerations, and detail the operation and function of safety systems.  Specific modes of operation covered are startup, normal operations, emergency and normal shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the McMullen Gas Plant employees receive training in specific safety and health hazards, operation of the flammable hydrocarbon process, emergency operations and all applicable safe work practices for the system.\n\nThe McMullen Gas Plant has a mechanical integrity program to ensure that all equipment is regularly inspected and maintained.  All inspections and maintenance operations are documented.  The McMullen Gas Plant has quality assurance mea"

The management of change (MOC) procedures ensure that any changes which are not \"replacement-in-kind\" are documented and analyzed to ensure that the change is safe.  The MOC procedure ensures that all changes are documented and properly authorized.  The procedures also ensures that all employees whose job tasks will be affected by the change are informed and receive appropriate training prior to the change.\n\nA pre-startup safety review will be conducted for any new covered process or significant modification to the flammable hydrocarbon process.  The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared prior to operation.  The performance of these safety programs and procedures is monitored through audits, periodic drills and inspections.\n\nThe McMullen Gas Plant will investigate any incident that results in, or could result in, a release of regulated flammable mixtures.  These investigations will follow a written procedure and be performed by a team from HPL Resources Company.  The goal of incident investigation is to determine the root cause of the accident and to develop corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence of the incident.  All corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team recommendations will be tracked until complete.\n\nThe employee participation plan details employee involvement in safety and the prevention program.\nThe McMullen Gas Plant has a contractor safety program to ensure that contractors who work in or adjacent to the flammable hydrocarbon process are properly trained and meet safety criteria defined by HPL Resources Company.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe McMullen Gas Plant has experienced one accidental release in the last five years, which meet"

No offsite public or environmental receptors were impacted; however, one employee was injured onsite.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nTo be prepared for potential fires, the McMullen Gas Plant communicates with the Tilden Volunteer Fire Department who is contacted by the gas plant in the event of a NFPA 4 flammable liquid release.  The McMullen Gas Plant has an Emergency Response Plan and employees have received emergency response training.\n\nSafety Improvements\nTo achieve the McMullen Gas Plant's excellent safety track record, safety improvements have been made over the last decade.  These include:\n\n- Reduction in propane\n- Reduction in butane\n- Elimination of depropanizer\n- Elimination of debutanizer\n\nThe McMullen Gas Plant will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the prevention programs and provide continuous improvement."
