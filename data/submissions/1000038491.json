The executive summary identifies hazards associated with operation of Loveland Products, Inc.-Billings (LPI-Billings) and describes practices in place to mitigate those hazards.  This information is available to local emergency response groups.  It is also available to the public in limited form.  This document also provides for control of other information required to be submitted in the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThis document should be reviewed for required changes whenever the RMPlan is updated.\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\nDepartment of Labor (OSHA), 29 CFR part 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, February 24, 1992\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule, 40 CFR part 68, Final Rule, June 20, 1996\n\n\n\nPROCEDURE\n\n\n\nHow Coverage was Determined for Loveland Products Inc.- Billings\n\n\n\nDimethylamine is listed in the RMP rule and is stored above the threshold quantity at Loveland Products, Inc.-Billings.  EPA's RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description and Use of RMP Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nLoveland Products, Inc.-Billings (LPI-Billings) is located in Section 26, Township 1 North, Range 26 East in Yellowstone County, Montana and encompasses approximately 27 acres.  LPI-Billings is a subdivision of Crop Protection Services (CPS).  LPI-Billings operates a herbicide formulation facility which blends and reacts raw technical active herbicide ingredients with alcohols, solvents, amines or water to produce finished products.\n\n\n\nDimethylamine (DMA) is used to produce herbicides through the amination of technically active herbicide ingredients.  The DMA amination process consists of a 60% aqueous solution of DMA along with a bulk active solid in a bat"

Although controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the worst-case flammable endpoint is 0.30 miles.\n\n\n\nThe real life preventative measures which are not considered in the WCS evaluation are:\n\n       * DOT pressurized tank car specified for DMA transportation and handling \n\n       * Nitrogen purge preventing DMA vapor release to atmosphere and eliminating static air in the tank car\n\n       * Maintenance and inspection programs to monitor equipment integrity \n\n       * In-house operating and startup procedures\n\n       * Operators montor flow through automation system for quick response to process deviations\n\n       * Inventory minimization during non-DMA production periods\n\n       * Process has failclose valves before and after DMA pump and one at the blend vessel\n\n       * Manual shut-off of DMA system\n\nWith these practices in place, LPI-Billings considers the complete release of a full 25,000 gallon tank car to be a low probability.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO (ARS)\n\n\n\nThe alternate case scenario has been determined to be a compromise in a transfer line outside of the building between the railcar and the reacting vessel.  The largest potential loss of DMA would occur during a transfer which would be discovered and addressed within 10 minutes of the transfer startup.  Based off of the actual gpm transfer of 60% DMA over a 10 minute timeframe, the calculated amount of DMA that would potentially be released is 1295 lbs. or 188 gallons. The maximum distance to the flamable endpoint is 0.08 miles.  Accident pr"

Processes regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements applicable to RMP and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The administrative procedures used for process safety management have been revised to incorporate all RMP required items and these procedures are now considered PSM/RMP administrative procedures.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nLPI-Billings encourages employees to participate in plant safety.  PSM/RMP elements include employee participation through writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures, compiling process safety information and participating in process hazard analysis'.  Additionally, employee's have been instructed to come forward with their safety concerns.  Process' that fall under RMP requirements already are subject to PSM requirements.  Programs are in place that address both PSM and RMP regulations.  All PSM/RMP materials are available to employees.\n\n\n\nAdditional detail, including responsibilities, may be found in PSM-ADM-02 of the PSM administrative procedure.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATON (PSI)\n"

Within this program, each unit is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe techniques LPI-Billings uses in it PHA's are the What If/Checklist and HAZOP analysis for specific nodes.  The HAZOP technique is one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluations available.  All PHA's are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and makes recommendations for additional prevention and safety measures or design changes when the team believes such actions are necessary.\n\n\n\nLocal management reviews"

Implementation of recommendations in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA Team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios are assigned the highest risk ranking and thus receive immediate attention.  All approved recommendations being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  Upon completion of all recommendations for a specific PHA, a final report is issued that all affected employees can access, thus having knowledge that all the recommendations for the PHA have been resolved.  To insure process safety at LPI-Billings, each process is required to have a PHA revalidation every five years. \n\n\n\nAdditional detail, including responsibilities, can be found in the Process Hazard Analysis procedure (PSM-ADM-04).\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nLPI-Billings maintains written operating procedures for normal operations and emergency procedures.  Startup and shutdown procedures are included in the normal operating procedures since LPI-Billings produces in batches.  Emergency procedures include the assignment of responsibility of shutdown and startup procedures.  Included in the operating procedures is guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process steps or equipment parameter deviations.\n\n\n\nThese procedures are used by operators and are used in the training of new operators.  All procedures are reviewed at least annually by the area supervisor.  Whenever a change is required the management of change procedure is initiated.

New employees receive basic training in operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  When new operators can demonstrate through tests or skills demonstration that they have the knowledge necessry to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they may be qualified for a job position and allowed to work independently.
