If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Clay County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\r\n2.\tFacility Information\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for the purpose.\r\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point was determined with the EPA RMP Comp Model.  The population was determined by using census information from area maps and community directorates.\r\nThe alternate release scenario:  a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve-valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The distance to the end point was determined the EPA RMP Comp model.\r\n\r\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is reference in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b)"
