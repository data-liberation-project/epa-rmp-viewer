This resulted in a change (decrease) in worst case scenario for toxics at the facility.  In addition, there has been information added to the 5 year Accident History and details from worst case and alternate case scenarios have been removed.\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  Huntsman Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the Odessa site having earned OSHA's VPP Star Certification Program.  The Huntsman Odessa facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.  The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Odessa participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in January 1993, the Odessa Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (IS0) 9002 quality management program.\n\nThe Odessa site is subject to numerous safety and environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels.  The Odessa site is subject to Clear Air Act (CAA) Title V.  There are two identifiers for the air operating permits (O-01230 for the East and O-02150 for West).  Although assigned numbers, they currently are in the application review phase and actual permits have not yet been issued by the TNRCC.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances: Huntsman's Odessa site is located in Odessa, Texas.  The Odessa site operates five Program Level 3 processes.  These processes receive, handle and store flammable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of olefins and specialty grade polymers.  End "

Huntsman's Odessa site has large volumes of several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butene and butane.  The Odessa site uses small volumes of toxic chemicals, which are consumed in the process.  The toxic chemicals are:\n-Hydrogen Chloride - Used in manufacture of polypropylene.\n-Chlorine-Used for microbiological control in cooling tower water.\n-Vinyl Acetate- Used as a co-monomer in the manufacture of polyethylene.\n\n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis:  The RMP Rule requires offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  Distances for worst case and alternative release scenarios in this RMP have been calculated using the methods described in EPA's OCA Guidance Document.  The population within the circles defined by these distances has been calculated using the Landview III program.  For release scenarios where there are no public residences inside the circle, the reported population is zero.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThese worst case scenarios are based on EPA required assumptions, are highly unlikely, and have not occurred at this facility.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), involving an underground hydrocarbon storage well.  \n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of toxic substances is a chlorine vapor release from a 2000 lb. cylinder. \n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe alternative case scenarios used in this RMP do not tak"

The one active mitigation measure considered is isolation of releases after 10 to 20 minutes. \n\nThe alternative case scenario for flammable substances is a complete seal failure on the LPG Pump (P-55C) in the Utilities area.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for anhydrous hydrogen chloride is a vapor release from a failure of the 1/4 inch piping off the 600-pound cylinder, resulting in release of 410 pounds of hydrogen chloride.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for chlorine is a release of vapor from a failure of the 3/8 inch tubing off a 1 ton container of chlorine resulting in the release of 210 pounds of chlorine.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for vinyl chloride is a pump seal failure on the pump used for unloading vinyl acetate from a truck into a storage tank.  \n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:  Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Odessa site has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nHuntsman's Odessa site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n- Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.  \n- The technology of the process: Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure, and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n- Equipment in the process: Includes such information a"

The Odessa site utilizes the HAZOP and What-if/Checklist methodologies, recognized and generally accepted methods for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.
