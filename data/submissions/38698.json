      "SummaryText": "andard as judged by an independent third party verifier.\n\nPerstorp Polyols has taken the ISO 14001 standard a step further and has applied the management system to the safety and health of our employees.  This step ensures that safety and health issues will be addressed in a systematic manner that strives for continuous improvement.  By addressing these matters this way, Perstorp Polyols is incorporating the management practices of Responsible Care with the international ISO 14001 standard in our work every day to reduce the risk of accidents that could result in harm to our employees, the public, and the environment.  Perstorp Polyols is also certified under the ISO 9001-2000 standard for Quality Systems.\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Planning process, Perstorp Polyols has worked closely with the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This close working relationship helps educate our emergency responders of the risks that are presented by our facility, the work that is on-going to prevent accidents from occurring and reduce the potential impact of an accident if it occurs, and make them more familiar with our facility.  We also benefit from this relationship in that we learn from the experience of our emergency responders in dealing with incidents at other facilities and the preventative actions that can be taken to further reduce the risk of an accident at our facility.  \n\nPerstorp Polyols annually reports its environmental performance in an environmental report that is issued by the Perstorp Group separately from the annual financial report.  The annual environmental report for the Perstorp Group can be found on the Perstorp web-site at www.perstorp.se.\n\n\nPerstorp Polyols? Toledo facility\n\nPerstorp Polyols, Inc. is part of Perstorp AB, a global company active in the application areas of chemistry and materials technology. Perstorp Polyols Inc began operations in Toledo, Ohio in 1977 with the purchase of a Pentaerythritol and Sodium Formate manufactur"

Since 1977 the operations have expanded to include manufacturing of Trimethylolpropane, Formaldehyde and concrete admixtures.\n\nIn 1997, Perstorp Polyols completed construction and started a new state?of?the-art Formaldehyde plant. This plant was designed using Perstorp Polyols? own technology with stack gas recycling and a catalytic emission control system to reduce emissions by oxidizing volatile organic chemicals to water and carbon dioxide.   The Formaldehyde is used both in house in the Pentaerythritol, Trimethylolpropane, and concrete admixture manufacturing processes and is sold externally for use in the manufacturing of particleboard, clothing and pharmaceuticals.  Formaldehyde is one of the chemicals covered by the requirements of the Risk Management Planning rule and is included as part of this submission because it is stored at the facility in excess of 15,000 pounds.\n\nPentaerythritol and Trimethylolpropane are used in the production of resins for paint and coatings, inks and adhesives, lubricants and urethane foam. Sodium Formate is used for paper bleaching, leather tanning, cattle feed and in the production of liquid detergents.  Acetaldehyde is a raw material used in the production of Pentaerythritol.  Storage of acetaldehyde is included in this submission because acetaldehyde is one of the chemicals covered by the requirements of the Risk Management Planning rule and it is stored at the Toledo facility in excess of 10,000 pounds.\n\nPrevention program\n\nPerstorp Polyols considers prevention of accidental releases at all stages of the plant operation.  This prevention program begins with designing for safety in the processes.  All systems are designed according to accepted industry codes.  Perstorp Polyols? plants and operating systems are designed and operated with redundant safety systems and instrumentation.  The purpose of these systems is to provide back-up safety protection in the event a primary safety system fails.  Modern technology "

      "SummaryText": "is used in the design and construction of processes.  All new or modified plants are inspected and reviewed before start-up.  Tanks used to store chemicals are placed in concrete secondary containment areas to prevent possible leaks or releases from reaching soil, ground or surface water.  Most tanks are equipped with high level alarms that alert operators that the tanks are nearly full and some of these alarms are equipped to shutdown the pump that is supplying the tank to prevent overfilling.\n\nAnother step of the prevention program includes the maintenance of the plants and their safety systems.  Preventative maintenance on processes is regularly conducted to protect against equipment failures.  While this does not guarantee that equipment will not occasionally break down, it reduces the risk that a problem will occur.  Safety systems are inspected and tested regularly to ensure that they will be operational if a problem develops within the process.  This includes annual or semiannual inspection and testing of fire suppression systems by outside contractors as well as inspection and testing of pressure relief devices within the processes.  Systems that are designed to shutdown when an upset occurs are often tested during plant downtime to ensure they will function to shut the process down if the upset condition occurs.\n\nPerstorp Polyols employees prevent accidents by operating the processes in a safe and efficient manner.  Our operators are well trained in operating instructions for the processes.  They were involved in the development of many of these operating instructions, either by reviewing the instructions when they were being written or by writing the instructions themselves.  Written unloading and operating instructions are regularly reviewed and kept up to date.\n\nPerstorp Polyols believes that safe design, good maintenance practices, and well-trained operators are very important parts of the prevention program.  However, we have found that a key part of m"

These reviews are designed and used to ensure that we do what our procedures say that we are doing.  Therefore, Perstorp Polyols conducts audits and reviews on safety and environmental systems as well as the operational phases of our facility.  We use internal reviews of procedures and operations to verify they reflect the appropriate level of safety, quality and environmental protection.  Independent third-party verifiers regularly review our quality and environmental management systems to ensure that Perstorp Polyols continuously improves the operation of the facility.\n\nIn addition to the work under the ISO standards described earlier and the Responsible Care initiative, Perstorp Polyols incorporates the requirements of government requirements such as the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Plan in the overall management system for safety, health and the environment.  This ensures that protection of the environment and employee safety is a part of every day operations at Perstorp Polyols.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDespite the prevention program described earlier, Perstorp Polyols must prepare and plan for emergencies that may occur.  There are many government regulations that require emergency plans and in 1996, OSHA, EPA, Coast Guard, and Department of Transportation worked together to develop a uniform plan for emergencies.  That plan, called the Integrated Contingency Plan, is used at Perstorp Polyols to provide a single source of information and procedures in the event of an emergency.  Copies of the plan have been provided to the Toledo Fire and Police Departments, several local hospitals, and the Ohio EPA so they are aware of the emergency plan at Perstorp Polyols.\n\nTraining is provided to our employees on the plan at least once a year.  Evacuation drills for employees are conducted annually as well.  The facility is equipp"

This alarm is tested regularly to ensure that it is operational and can be heard throughout the facility.  Occasionally drills are performed on-site in conjunction with the Toledo Fire Department Hazardous Materials Unit.  Perstorp Polyols also takes an active role in the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Our participation in this group with emergency responders includes assisting in planning large-scale drills and public education of risks and emergency preparedness.\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nPerstorp Polyols has not had an accidental release of acetaldehyde or formaldehyde within the past five years.\n\n\nWorst case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios\n\nPerstorp Polyols is submitting two situations that meet the EPA criteria for worst-case release scenarios.  One situation covers the storage of acetaldehyde and the second situation covers the storage of formaldehyde.  Perstorp Polyols is also submitting two situations that are required under EPA criteria for alternative release scenarios; one for acetaldehyde and one for formaldehyde.  All four situations have off-site impacts in that modeling indicates the impact will leave the facility property.  Perstorp Polyols has used the EPA Off-site Consequences Analysis Guidance for modeling these situations.  Based on this guidance, none of the situations will have an impact on residential areas.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nPerstorp Polyols has a commitment to continuous improvement in the areas of safety, health and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated in the semi-annual audits of our environmental management system by independent verifiers, the weekly safety and environmental training program for our employees, as well as our on going suggestion program for our employees.  Internal audits of our operations are on going throughout the year.  The suggestion program gives our empl"
