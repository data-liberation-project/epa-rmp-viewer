Our safety and environmental programs are managed by qualified employees on site, and are actively supported by the participation of all employees and management, and a strong central staff. The goal of both the safety and environmental programs is accident prevention. Safety teams which focus on training and special projects have been formed in every department across this site.  Although P&G's safety record is already among the best in the business, we are constantly striving for improvement. The Augusta site was recognized for its excellent safety record by the Occupation Safety/Health Award Program in which we received the 1997 Merit Award for having over two million consecutive employee hours without a work-related injury or illness.\n\nP&Gs Augusta Site is very committed to the safety of the local residents and our employees, as well.  For instance, several P&G employees are active members of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  P&G has supported the LEPC by donating fire fighting equipment, sponsoring special training events (such as confined space entry training), sponsoring emergency drills, leading meetings, serving on committees, and providing financial support for upgrading the personal protective gear used by the responders. The site also has sixteen employees trained to serve on the on P&G Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) Response Team. Also, seven P&G employees are volunteer firefighters, and two of our employees are volunteer Emergency Medical Technicians. \n\nP&G is also very committed to safety and to the protection of the natural environment.

Our Augusta site was also one of the first ten companies nationally to make a risk management assessment available to the general public.  Also, P&G Augusta site employees have participated in several local environmental campaigns including the Augusta Earth Day celebrations, environmental training in schools, and the Adopt a Highway anti-litter program.\n\nSYSTEMS AND PROCESSES FOR SAFE USE OF OLEUM  \n\nThe P&G Augusta site manufactures dry laundry detergent. Oleum is one of the key raw materials used to make the detergent. Oleum is delivered to our site by dedicated railcars during daylight hours, and is unloaded into one of  two 25,000 gallon tanks in a diked unloading area.  The two storage tanks are above ground, and are also diked. The tanks are visually inspected quarterly, and the metal walls are routinely tested for integrity.  The storage and unloading areas are remotely monitored by video cameras.  The unloading and storage areas are remotely monitored by continuous video cameras placed in critical areas. The storage tanks are heated to the minimum level in order to keep the oleum in a liquid state for use in our process. Slight wisps or vapors present when opening the railcar for unloading and during maintenance are collected in a mist vacuum and scrubber system. Oleum is completely consumed in the reactions in our processes. \n\nMINIMIZING POTENTIAL FOR ACCIDENTAL ATMOSPHERIC RELEASES\n\nA detailed hazard study conducted as required for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) was used to identify potential points from which oleum may be spilled or leaked from the process. These points have received special consideration during the process design, the training of operators and maintenance personnel, and the development of our accident prevention and response systems. The studies are updated routinely by a team of specially trained employees and engineers. Training, maintenance, controls, operating prac"

An instantaneous release of this kind could be caused by an earthquake or by an airplane hitting the tank. This worst case release also assumes that no emergency response would occur, even though both the site Haz-Mat Team and the LEPC are trained to respond to this type of spill. The spill of an entire storage tank would be confined to an existing diked area. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is defined as a 10 minute release from a leaking unloading line at more normal weather conditions. The use of foam suppression systems and/or shutting valves to shut down the operation could be activated well within 10 minutes.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS:  ASSESSMENT OF PLANT COMMUNITY - HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe goal of the safety and environmental programs at P&G is accident prevention. A computer model was used to estimate the distance a vapor cloud at a certain concentration (predetermined by EPA) could travel in the unlikely event of the worst case scenario (as defined above), with no available emergency response. The population impact (estimated in the RMPlan) is based on the total number of people that live within the radius of the hazard distance. Since the winds would either blow the cloud in only one direction or disperse the cloud more quickly if it was to blow in multiple directions, the impacts presented above overestimate the impact of a worst case release. \n\nA ten-minute leak resulting from a failure in the unloading line was the event chosen for our alternative release scenario. There is no residential population within the impact radius of this scenario.  Once again, the impacts presented above would overestimate the impact of this release scenar"

The entire oleum system has numerous and redundant process controls, detection and alarm systems, and an emergency shut-down system. Highly skilled operators monitor the process around the clock from a control room equipped with cameras and computers that monitor the liquid levels in the tanks, the temperature and pressure of the tank contents, and unloading information.\n\nThe process design and operating systems are continually assessed and improved through a procedure detailed by the OSHA regulations for Process Safety Management (PSM). Process operators, engineers, and the site safety leaders work together to implement the OSHA PSM. Improvements resulting from these assessments over the last five years include: \n7 managing the oleum inventory at a lower level, \n7 reducing the temperature of the oleum in storage, \n7 requiring that deliveries occur only during daylight hours, and \n7 enhancing one of the mist eliminator (vacuum and scrubber) systems. \n\nIn the event of an accident, the site has systems to respond to the spill or leak quickly. Spills or leaks of oleum can be quickly communicated to the emergency responders by personnel on the scene from phones which are located in the control rooms, near the oleum unloading and storage areas. The police and fire departments have procedures to manage communications and instructions to the public through the use of an emergency siren, news and radio broadcasts, and direct communications in the streets of the potentially affected neighborhoods. \n\nResponse drills are conducted annually with the aid of the LEPC. The drills create opportunities to train new responders, to refresh the skills of the experienced responders, and to improve the communications and response s"

The operating procedures include both routine and non-routine operations. Sixteen employees are trained as part of a Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) Team; three or  four Haz-Mat Team members are available on each shift. Our employees also participate in the emergency response drills held annually. The results of both the hazard assessments and the emergency response drills are communicated to the operating and unloading teams. \n\nAn emergency response plan has been developed and coordinated with the LEPC, including the fire department, hospitals, and police. As recommended by the EPA, this plan is developed using their \"One Plan\" guide for ease of use. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe hazard assessments conducted here will be used to help P&G further update training and operational procedures.  These assessments will continue to be conducted in the future so that we can effectively address the high priority items they identify.\n\nHISTORY OF SAFE OPERATIONS\n\nThe P&G Augusta site has an excellent history of oleum system safety. P&G takes pride in the fact that there have been no accidents at this site involving oleum or the oleum system that caused injury or property damage to anyone on site or off site during the last 5 years."
