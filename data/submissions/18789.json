      "SummaryText": "          The Delaware Water Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP) because of our inventory of chlorine on hand.  We have a chlorine process which consists of a single one ton chlorine cylinder being on-line with the process at a time and three one ton cylinders (maximum) in storage.  The cylinder is connected to a chlorinator right at the main cylinder valve.  A vacuum system pulls the chlorine from the cylinder as needed.  If a line would break or develop a small leak, then the vacuum is broken and the chlorine process automatically shuts down.  As long as the regulator valve in the chlorinator is working properly then the chlorine should not be able to escape from the cylinder when a leak is present.  Our process is also monitored with chlorine detectors and audible alarms throughout the plant as well as by a visual inspection every four hours by the operator on duty.\n          Our worst case scenario shows an affected area of a radius of 2.6 miles.  The process is basically contained within a building which would help prevent a toxic vapor cloud from spreading.  The area surrounding the plant is in a low lying area surrounded  by several trees which will also help keep  a toxic vapor cloud within the immediate area of the plant.  The vast majority of affected public receptors in the event of a worst case scenario would be located on the outskirts of the radius of the affected area.\n          The Water Plant has developed an emergency response plan in coordination with the Delaware County Emergency Services and our staff has been trained on how to respond in the event of a toxic release of chlorine.  The plant has been in operation for many years now without ever having a chlorine release incident and hopefully we never will experience a release incident.  With the Risk Management Plan, we should be better able to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chlorine."
