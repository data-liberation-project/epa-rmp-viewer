The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia stored at the facility is 202,200 pounds.  3. The Worst-Case Release and Alternative Release Scenario - The worst Case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount woild release 144,400 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia.  All the tanks are enclosed in a secondary containment area, tne truck loading area also has a containment basin, for controlling spills.  The distance to the endpoint is .59 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident is a release from either the 20,000 gallon or the 8,000 gallon storage tank, the distance to end point is .18 miles.  4.
