The owners, management and employees of Sprague Grange Supply Inc., Railroad and D Street, Sprague, Washington 99032, with the fertilizer branch operation located at First and B Streets, Sprague, Washington 99032 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event on an accidental release.  2.  Facility Information - * The primary activity at the fertilizer facility is the storae, sale and delivery to the user farm of both liquide and dry fertilizers. * Aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for bothdirect application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  * Aqua ammonia is received bytanker truck and stored in 1- 8,000 gallon and 1-20,000 gallon above ground storage tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia stored at the facility is 202,200 pounds.  3. The Worst-Case Release and Alternative Release Scenario - The worst Case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount woild release 144,400 pounds of 20% aqua ammonia.  All the tanks are enclosed in a secondary containment area, tne truck loading area also has a containment basin, for controlling spills.  The distance to the endpoint is .59 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident is a release from either the 20,000 gallon or the 8,000 gallon storage tank, the distance to end point is .18 miles.  4. Accidental release Prevention Program - Aqua Ammonia - The facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requiremetnts for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" published by the American National Standards Insti"
