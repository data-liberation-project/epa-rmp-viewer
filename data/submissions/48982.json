Due to our release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum. There have been no major accidents as defined in 40 CFR Part 68, from our facility within the last 5 years.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nPenn Specialty Chemicals, Inc. Memphis Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nMemphis-Shelby County has its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.

The furan liquid is assumed to be immediately released from which evaporation takes place.  \n\nAn alternative release scenario is also included for furan as part of the Program 3 processes. The alternative release scenario allows use of active and passive mitigation. The alternative release scenario evaluates the five-year accident history (see section 5 below) to evaluate potential scenarios. Since there have been no incidents as defined by EPA, an artificial scenario was created. It is important to note that the facility significantly reduced the storge of Ammonia to less than the threshhold amount by instituting process changes at the facility thereby decreasing risk to employees, neighbors, and the environment.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State Building codes.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 including the one containing furan.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPenn Specialty Chemicals, Inc.

Plant Memphis, Tennessee\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Penn Specialty Chemicals, Inc. Memphis Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is evidenced by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, the Memphis site utilizes the highly trained Shelby County Emergency Response Team to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are completely coordinated with Memphis-Shelby County LEPC on all incidents that may impact the community. \n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Organic chemical synthesis.  We have 1 RMP substance regulated at our facility.  The substance is furan, which is involved in several uses.  Furan is used for chemical synthesis and is then converted into other organic compounds or sold as a commercial chemical product.  \n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. In order to perform the required off-site consequence analysis the Penn Memphis facility used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  While Penn Memphis has excellent programs to respond to a release of furan, this worst case scenario does not allow any active mitigation to be considered, and further requires the release to occur under conditions that are not indicative of any conditions which have been encountered.
