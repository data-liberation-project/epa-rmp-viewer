MAAP/W processes grain to produce fuel grade ethanol and high protein animal feed.\n\n\n\n\n\nA)       It is the policy of the MAAP/W facility to implement the\n\nrequirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR 68.  The objective is to prevent an explosion, fire, and/or release of aqueous ammonia, and in the unlikely event of a release to minimize the potential impact to MAAP/W's employees, the public, and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees, hiring qualified contractors, and coordinating response activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nB)      Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMAAP/W is a dry mill ethanol plant that processes corn into value added products such as fuel grade ethanol and high protein animal feed.\n\nIn this resubmission of the Risk Management Plan, MAAP/W has included programs for its aqueous ammonia system and for its denaturant system, both of which are used in the production of fuel ethanol.  These are the RMP regulated substances which exceed the reporting threshold for an RMP.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia is used for pH adjustment in the fuel alcohol production.  The denaturant (natural gasoline) is used to denature the anhydrous ethanol for shipment to make the alcohol unfit for human consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nC)      Off-Site Consequence Analyses and Accidental Release Prevention\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios were conducted for both the aqueous ammonia and denaturant processes.  These release scenarios were conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 68 and using the EPA's RMP*Comp version 1.07.\n\nThe key concepts in MAAP/W's prevention program are the elements of their OSHA Process Safety Management"

The facility maintains a written emergency action plans to deal with prevention of and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nF)      Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMAAP/W will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety and minimize risk at the MAAP/W facility.  MAAP/W plans to utilize its safety committee to identify risks and address safety concerns of the RMP covered processes.\n\n\n\n"
