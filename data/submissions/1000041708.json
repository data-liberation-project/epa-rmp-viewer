Facility Policy:  The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity for the facility is a retail farm supply NAICS 424910: which operates a small retail store, custom applies dry fertilizers, sells packaged and bulk agricultural chemicals, seeds, seed treatment and operates a small liquid fertilizer mixing process that utilizes liquid anhydrous ammonia as an ingredient in the process. The anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used in a liquid fertilizer mixing process as specified by the farmer's requirements. The resulting liquid blend is used for direct application as a crop production nutrient. \n\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario:  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program:  This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency.  Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees.  \n\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6.
