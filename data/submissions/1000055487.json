This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training, design safety, operation and maintenance of the facility.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nDry Trail Plant is located in Texas County, Oklahoma, 12 miles north of Guymon, Oklahoma on Highway 136, 10 miles west on County Road 7.  Dry Trail Plant recovers carbon dioxide (CO2) from gas from an oil field that is using liquid CO2 injection for secondary oil recovery.  In the process of extracting the CO2 and returning it to a liquid state, natural gas and natural gas liquids are also recovered.  Propane is used as the coolant to restore the CO2 to a liquid state. \n\n\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant has met the criteria for a RMP program level 1 facility.  The facility has no public receptors within a distance to the endpoint from a worst case release scenario and the process has not had a release of a regulated substance in the past five years.  In addition, the facility has coordinated its emergency response activities with local responders.  Although the facility is subject to OSHA PSM and is in one of the NAICS codes listed for a program level 2 facility, it has met all of the requirements of an RMP Program Level 1 facility as stated in Section 2.1 (2) in the USEPA General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention dated April 2004.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Sc"

While the facility believes that it is highly unlikely that a release from one system would immediately impact the other system, both systems were modeled as one process for the purpose of the worst case scenario calculation. This approach to modeling the worst case scenario will provide a very conservative worst case distance to endpoint result. \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario associated with the release of flammable substances from the facility assumes that the entire volume from the largest vessel in each process is released simultaneously over a ten minute period resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The vessels considered were the 30,000 gallon NGL storage tank for the NGL extraction system and the 10,000 gallon surge tank in the propane refrigeration system. The NGL storage tank is typically operated to reach a maximum level of 50 percent; however, theoretically a level of 80 percent could be reached in the tank so the 80 percent level was used for the worst case scenario analysis. Since all of the components of the NGL mixture as well as the propane in the refrigeration system have similar heats of combustion, the worst-case analysis calculation was conducted assuming that the entire volume of the process to be propane, which is the largest component of the process by weight. RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a flammable vapor cloud explosion.   A distance of 0.4 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined for a release of 152,200 pounds for the process.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage its consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this worst case scenario release.\n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario for flammable substances was not considered for either proce"

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  The information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant primarily uses the What-if/Checklist method for identifying hazards.  In addition, the hazard analysis and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique may also be used.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startups, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed for accuracy.

After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstrations) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is required to be conducted every three years.  All this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review personnel use checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA re-validations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Dry Trail Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
