These Analyses included a review of chlorine gas safety devices currently used at the Reclamation Facility.  Based upon results of the 1999 Process Hazard Analysis, the Agency improved the active mitigation measures for containment of chlorine gas in the event of a leak; hence, a Chlorine Gas Scrubber was installed in 2000.\n\nAdditional safety measures were installed and discussed during a June 2005 PHA.  An Emergency Shut-Off System was installed to provide a secondary containment mechanism between the pressurized one-ton containers and the vacuum regulator.  In the event of a chlorine gas release, the emergency shut-off valve will close.\n\nIn result from the November 2008 PHA revalidation a placard was installed in the 1-ton cylinder storage area that says, \"No Stacking more than 2 rows high\".  This would help mitigate operators from stacking the cylinders more than two high and minimize the potential for cylinder rolling."

The purpose of this program is to reduce or eliminate the possibility of accidental release of substances regulated under these guidelines.\t\t\t\t\t\nIn Desert Water Agency's daily operation, chlorine gas is used for the disinfection of potable and reclaimed water.  Currently chlorine gas is stored and used at the Agency's Wastewater Reclamation Facility in quantities greater than the process threshold limits specified under OSHA PSM, US EPA RMP, and CalARP regulations.  The regulations require that a Risk Management Program be developed and submitted for any processes that includes the use of quantities of regulated substances greater than the process threshold limits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDesert Water Agency currently uses the Reclamation Facility as a chlorine gas storage and chlorination facility.  Vessels stored at the facility include 150-lb. cylinders and one-ton containers.  Maximum intended chlorine gas inventory calculations performed in the RMP show the maximum intended inventory of chlorine gas stored at the Reclamation Facilities to be 28,000 lbs.  This amount is greater than the EPA's RMP Threshold Limit of 2,500 lbs. and OSHA's PSM Threshold limit of 1,500 lbs., and therefore falls under these regulations.\t\n\t\t\t\t\nSince this facility falls under OSHA's PSM regulations and there is a potential for chlorine gas to reach offsite receptors, the Chlorination Process at the Reclamation Facility falls under Program Level 3 of the RMP's regulations.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements, the Agency reviewed the accident history at the Reclamation Facility for the past five years.  The Agency has not experienced an accident resulting from an accidental release of chlo"
