If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Lehigh County LEPC as well as the Lower Macungie Fire Department and Emergency Management Agency, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Lehigh County LEPC, Macungie Ambulance Corps and Lehigh Valley Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade but does employ a hazardous materials response team and trained incipient stage fire response on-site to respond to small or the initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Pipe Line Company L.P. - Macungie Station is a pipeline breakout station, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending and propane systems only, including the associated piping and storage vessels, butane and propane railcars (propane storage for an adjacent facility may occur on the Buckeye Pipe Line rail spur), a remote butane, and vaporizer fuel (propane) vessels.\n\n\n\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the blending system's butane storage vessels when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) release scenario is a Vapor Cloud Explosion of a butane railcar filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The resulting distance to the endpoint 1 PSI overpressure extends off-site, and includes public and environmental receptors\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Pipe Line Company L.P. - Macungie Station complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68  Subpart D), th"

The facility currently has no trained fire brigade but does employ a hazardous materials response team and trained incipient fire response group.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated by the fire department and the Lehigh County LEPC along with the Lower Macungie Emergency Management Agency.  The Lower Macungie Fire Department/Emergency Management Agency/Code Enforcement and Fire Inspector have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\n\n\nProcess safety improvements being considered for this site include more frequent first responder drill participation, further integrating PSM/RMP documentation into the corporate \"Share Point\" system.  Also evaluation of other \"best practices\" including replace black ESD activators with red units (refer to Compliance Audit for non-regulatory, best practice considerations.)"
