      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nNeches Industrial Park, Inc. began operations in November 1995.  The terminal was purchased by Martin Midstream Partners LP in June of 2004 and renamed Neches Terminal.  Martin is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  Toward meeting this commitment the facility has in place an accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee, General Land Office, Coast Guard and any other state or Federal agencies in mitigating any release and minimizing the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED OR STORED\r\nMartin stores and handles the following regulated substances:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS: 7664-41-7)\r\nStorage Quantity:  89000000 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is stored at the facility, with the majority utilized for distribution to end users.  Shipment methods include bulk cargo trailers, rail, and barge.  A small portion of the ammonia is utilized for the on-site production of ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), which is considered part of the overall ammonia-PSM operations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nThe worst-case scenario is based on the rupture of a 34,000-ton (short) aboveground ammonia storage tank.  EPA rules would not allow use of water for mitigation when calculating our worst-case scenario.  Martin believes that the endpoint distance of 25 miles would be significantly reduced, since the tank is near water.  The endpoint distance was concluded using off-site consequence analysis guidance.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is based upon the activation of a railcar pressure relief valve and was selected due to the fr"

The endpoint distance of 0.24 miles is based upon ALOHA program calculations; the residential population would not be affected by this scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nMartin complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management Program (PSM) rules, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules and with applicable state codes and regulations.  \r\nMartin's commitment to have in place controls to eliminate the potential for a release include but in not limited to:\r\n\u00bf\tConstruction of two Anhydrous Ammonia storage tanks meeting the requirements of ANSI K61.1 and API-620 code.  Ammonia is stored (maintained) at  -27 degrees F.  to minimize initial flashing in the event of a tank release.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency vents and relief valves on transfer lines are routed to a closed-loop system which is vented to a flare.  \r\n\u00bf\tSafety instrumentation which include operation related alarms and interlocks.  Tank pressures are monitored twenty-four hours each day, seven days a week by site operators.  \r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia vapor detectors are in place to provide the earliest possible detection of an ammonia release\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity program which includes an inspection program with the objective on ensuring the proper operation of equipment.\r\n\u00bf\tA fixed camera system with a digital recording system that allows operators to continuously monitor the ammonia flare for problems with may result in a release.  \r\n\u00bf\tStorage tanks and loading facilities equipped with automatic emergency block valves to minimize a release.  In addition\r\n\u00bf\tFire monitors are strategically placed to mitigate the effects of a release of ammonia.\r\n\u00bf\tWork permits are used to control any hazardous work around the facility\r\n\u00bf\tManagement ensures that all personnel have the required level of process knowledge and experience.\r\n\u00bf\tThe facility is equipped with an audible warning"

Employees are included in planning meetings and development of procedures for the facility.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nMartin maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the process.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\nMartin conducts hazard analyses to identify potential hazards associated with our operations are identified and control implemented.

The emergency action plan includes appropriate mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when there is need for a response.  Designated site personnel are trained in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120 as Hazmat Technicians and an Incident Command structure in place.  The facility is listed in the community emergency response plan.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally the terminal is a U.S.  Coast Guard Maritime regulated facility.  With this in mind, the terminal participates in all local drills conducted by the Coast Guard and many times is used in an active role by having a simulated  ammonia released from the facility as a  primary part of the drill.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess and maintain safety conditions.  Martin has designated personnel to ensure the programs referenced in this Executive Summary are maintained.  Additionally the site has Environmental and Safety personnel to assist in these efforts.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Neches Terminal is committed to implementing controls necessary to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention and personnel training, as well as considering safety as one of the highest priorities in the installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes, in the unlikely event that a release occurs."
