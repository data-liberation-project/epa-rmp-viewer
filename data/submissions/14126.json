This belief covers on and off-job injuries, occupational illnesses and accidental releases.  DuPont is also committed to keeping its facilities ready to respond to any incident that occurs in spite of our best prevention efforts.\n\nDuPont established PSM on a Corporate basis in 1979.  General definitions, policies and organizational structure that implement PSM are given in Section S21A of the DuPont Safety and Occupational Health Guidelines.  PSM goals, policies and procedures are embodied in numerous corporate manuals and documents such as Engineering Standards, Safety Manuals and Guidelines.\n\nDuPont's LaPorte Plant endorses, adheres to and carries out Corporate PSM policies, procedures and guidelines.  The DuPont LaPorte Plant's Accidental Release Prevention policies come within the scope of the site's existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  We apply PSM to all processes and chemicals at this site, not just those covered by the RMP Regulation.\n\nThe stated purpose of the LaPorte Plant's PSM Program is to manage and control the hazards in our processes, to protect individuals, plant equipment, our business integrity, and our community through the elimination of hazards.  PSM involves the application of controls to our processes through operating & maintenance procedures and practices, training, management of change, equipment inspection, and auditing.\n\nThe Principles that govern the DuPont LaPorte Plant's PSM actions are:\n  --All injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are preventable.  We will work in a proactive,\n     preventive m"

At the time this RMPlan was prepared, there were four (4) Business Unit Leaders (one for each of the major businesses previously listed) who report administratively to the Plant Manager.  Each Business Unit Leader is responsible for\nProcess Safety Management (PSM), spill/release prevention, regulatory compliance and many aspects of Emergency Response within his/her individual Business unit.\n\nReporting to the Crop Protection Products Business Unit leader is a Site Leader-Environmental Affairs who has overall site responsibility for environmental regulatory compliance including the development, implementation, and integration of the site's risk management program elements.\n\nA Safety Supervisor who has overall site responsibility for Emergency Response and OSHA compliance reports directly to the Plant Manager.\n\nAlso reporting to the Plant Manager is a Shift Operations Leader (SOL) who has overall responsibility for plant operations.  A SOL is on duty 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The SOL carries a pager or radio at all times and can be contacted very quickly to deal with any type of release that might occur, and to coordinate emergency response efforts either on-site or off-site.\n\nAll operations at this facility including the Covered Processes listed below and the Environmental Control operations are attended 24 hours per day, 7 days per week by well trained, highly skilled personnel.\n\nAll accidental spills and releases occurring at this facility are documented, investigated and the residue, if any, is promptly cleaned up.\n\nSecurity\n\nA high le"

Our PSM  compliance program is directed toward preventing all serious process related chemical incidents that might affect plant personnel (employees, contractors, visitors) off-site communities, or the environment, or result in significant loss of property or business.  It involves the application of systems and controls to chemical manufacturing processes in a way that hazards are identified, understood and controlled so that process-related injuries and incidents are prevented.  The site's Accidental Release Prevention Program falls within the scope of our existing PSM program.\n\nThe fourteen (14) key elements of this facility's PSM program are:\n\nTechnology\n\n1.

This scenario assumes instant vaporization of the released material and no active mitigation.  EPA's OCA Guidance shows the impact of this release would extend off-site and impact all categories of receptors except Federal wilderness areas.  Such an incident is extremely unlikely due to:\n  --instantaneous vaporization is not physically possible\n  --active mitigation systems are designed to be fail safe\n  --high integrity design of the storage vessel\n  --frequent inspections for vessel integrity\n  --routine preventive maintenance\n  --highly trained and skilled operators and supervisors attend  the storage vessel 24 hours per day, 7"

Management of subtle change\n\nDuPont's PSM Program is applied to two categories of process activities:\n\n  --Higher Hazard Processes (HHP's) - any activity that manufacturers, handles, stores or uses hazardous\n     substances  that, when released or ignited, can result in death or irreversible human health effects,\n     significant property or environmental damage, or off-site impacts due to acute  toxicity, flammability,\n     explosivity, corrosivity, thermal  instability, latent heat, or compression.\n\n  --Lower Hazard Operations (LHO's) - any activity that exclusively manufactures, handles, stores, or\n     uses any substance with low potential for death or irreversible human health effects, significant\n     property or environmental damage, or off-site impacts due to toxicity, asphyxiation, or mechanical\n     hazards including stored energy.\n\nSpecific Risk Reduction Achievements\n\nDuring the time this RMPlan was in preparation, three (3) RMP Regulated Substances were eliminated from the site:\n  --Sulfur trioxide (SO3) - a 600 thousand pound storage tank was taken out of service and dismantled.\n     There is now less than  a threshold quantity of this material in the Fluoroproducts Process.\n  --Aqueous Ammonia >20% - this material was eliminated from three (3) different processes by either\n     switching to a lower concentration material or lowering the inventory to less than threshold.\n  --Bromine - a process using this material was discontinued\n\nIn late 1984, storage of methyl isocyanate (now a RMP Regulated Substance) at this facility was eliminated as a result of the Bhopal, India, incident.  The largest inventory of this material ever present is now two (2) pounds or less.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAll employees at DuPont's LaPorte Plant are trained to recognize potential hazards associated with handling hazardous substances. Employees are trained in several independent ways of reporting actual and/or potential emergenc"

All methods of emergency reporting result in the sounding of a site-wide alarm.\n\nThe site-wide alarm automatically alerts the entire facility to the emergency, activates one of two previously designated Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) and summons the Emergency Response Team (ERT) to the incident location.  An Emergency Response Team (ERT) is on duty at the facility 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\nThe sounding of the site-wide alarm also initiates a number of other processes including:\n  --immediate mobilization of site emergency response resources\n  --preliminary assessment of the situation\n  --personnel accounting\n  --dispersion modeling to gauge the potential for off-site impact\n  --establishment of a Command Post near the incident location\n\nAt the Command Post, an Incident Commander (IC) takes charge of the situation and organizes and directs the ERT.  The widely recognized National Fire Academy Incident Command System (ICS) is used to manage safety, tactics, strategy, personnel, equipment, logistics and other resources.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Team (ERT) is trained to a high level of proficiency in incident command, interior structural fire fighting, fume and vapor suppression, emergency medical treatment (EMT) including cardiac care and invasive procedures, high angle and confined space rescue and hazardous material response.  The purpose of the ERT is to assist the facility in safeguarding employees and the community from the threat of fire, injuries, fume releases, medical illnesses, entrapment and other types of emergencies.  Minimum staffing levels for these skills and functions have been established and are available on-site at all times.\n\nA roster of off-shift emergency responders is maintained for call-out in the event additional personnel are required.  Full utilization of this resource can bring as many as 80 more trained emergency responders to bear on an incident.\n\nThis facility maintains an on-sit"
