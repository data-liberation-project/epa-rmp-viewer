Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThe Rexnord Corporation, Link-Belt Bearing Division (Rexnord) facility is located 7601 Rockville Road, \nIndianapolis, Indiana.  Rexnord maintains on site four (4) propane tanks, two with a maximum capacity of 30,000 \ngallons (127,500 pounds) each and two with a maximum capacity of 12,000 gallons (51,000 pounds) each. Propane \nis a listed flammable substance under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68 and is subject to\nthose regulations since it is stored in quantities in excess of 10,000 pounds. It is necessary to observe certain \nsafety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the \npersonal health of employees as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is the policy \nof Rexnord to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in\nwhich Rexnord handles propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe\nhandling procedures that are used, and the training of Rexnord personnel.\nThe emergency response program at this facility is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Safety Handbook, \"Guidelines for \nDeveloping Plant Emergency Procedures\" and \"How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires\". The emergency response plan\nincludes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected\nneighbors.\n\n2. Description of the stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nRexnord utilizes propane as a constituent for various furnace atmospheres and to supply the cracking gas to \nproduce endothermic gas in endothermic gas generators.  Propane is received by truck (transports) and stored in \nfour storage tanks.  This facility has equipment for unloading propane from road tankers.  Access to the site is \nrestricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel an"

      "SummaryText": "d authorized contractors. \nThe only regulated substance under section 112? handled at this facility is propane. \n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant is 357,000 pounds (84,000 gallons). \n\n3. Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of one of our storage tanks when filled to the maximum amount would affect the\nother three tanks and would release 314,160 pounds of propane.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity\nof each tank to 88% at 60 F (357,000x 0.88 = 314,160). It is assumed that the entire contents are released as \nvapor, which would find an ignition source, 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the \nresulting explosion. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1-psi for the worst-case scenario is 0.5 miles. \n\nAlternative Scenario. - A pull-away causing failure of a 25-foot length of 4-inch hose. The excess flow valves \nfunction to stop the flow. The content of the hose, which is 69 pounds, is released. The resulting unconfined\nvapor travels to the lower flammability limit. The release leads to a vapor cloud explosion (endpoint 1-psi).\nThe distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is 106 feet or \n0.02 miles (report as less than 0.1 mile). \n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and\nregulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. All of the employees handling\npropane have been thoroughly trained.\n\n5. Five-year accident history. \n\nIn the process of handling propane at this facility, there have not been any accidental releases of propane that\nled to deaths or injuries of people on- or off-site or response or restoration activities at environmental \nreceptors in the last five years. None of the employees or contractors has been invol"
