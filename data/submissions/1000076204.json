The propylene oxide distribution system at the Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal is managed/operated/maintained by DOW under contractual agreement with Lyondell.  There are no Lyondell or Covestro employees located at the North Charleston Distribution Terminal.  Covestro management at the South Charleston Plant provide instruction and direction to the DOW employees/contractors who operate the Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal because a majority of the PO is owned by Covestro and is ultimately transferred into the Covestro PO distribution system at the South Charleston manufacturing facility for use by Covestro and DOW Chemical in their manufacturing units.  The PO that is not owned by Covestro is owned by Lyondell. The North Charleston Distribution Terminal facility is treated as a separate stationary source because the Kanawha River separates it from the South Charleston Manufacturing Plant; therefore, it is considered noncontiguous with the South Charleston Plant.  Lyondell ships propylene oxide from the Texas Gulf Coast by barge to the North Charleston Distribution Terminal for storage and subsequent transfer to the South Charleston Plant where it is used in Polyol manufacture by Covestro and as a raw material by DOW in several of its manufacturing units. \r\n\r\nIn summary the Covestro South Charleston facility has one (1) RMP listed toxic chemical (propylene oxide) and no RMP flammable chemicals.  Propylene oxide was modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the distance to toxic endpoint.    \r\n\r\nc.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the EPA RMP Rule.

In the case of a significant fire the Charleston Fire department would be involved.

Community warning sirens are placed in multiple places in the Kanawha Valley and there is one within 1 mile of the plant. \r\n\r\nThe Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.
