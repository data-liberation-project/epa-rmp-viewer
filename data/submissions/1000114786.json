The highest level of an emergency is Level 3, which is defined as an emergency of a size and scope that would require outside resources.  A Level 3 emergency is triggered when life and property are endangered or when the emergency could result or has resulted in offsite consequences. \n\nLAR maintains an industrial fire brigade that specializes in rescue, hazardous materials, and spill containment.  Each Emergency Response Team (ERT) is led by a captain and consists of six to nine members.  External sources provide assistance in the form of alerting the public, evacuation, transportation, and providing hazard mitigation equipment, supplies, and personnel to complement LAR capabilities. It should be emphasized that external assistance may only be requested during a Level 3 emergency.  \n\nIn addition to these sources, LAR has coordinated with the local hospitals, clinics, and doctors about the properties of the various types of hazardous materials processed and handled at the refinery.  All ERT members, ERT captains, and asset safety coordinators are required to attend quarterly onsite training.  Outside training is also provided annually to various ERT members, shift supervisors, and asset safety coordinators.  Coordination activities and discussions are held with local emergency response organizations and emergency training is provided annually to the emergency response team.  ICS role-play is provided to refinery personnel as part of the periodic emergency drill.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nLAR has several Process Safety Initiative teams that continually review and measure the PSM elements and develop best practice that will enhance PSM to meet regulatory requirements.

An investigation was conducted and multiple recommendations were issued to reduce the potential for recurrence of the incident.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery has implemented an Emergency Response Program (ERP) to prepare for potential incidents, respond to them effectively, and recover from their impacts.  The ERP has included a set of potential incidents that are used for emergency drills, including accidental release of toxic gases (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide), accidental release of flammable materials resulting in a fire and explosion, and accidental spill of hazardous materials on the ground within the refinery perimeter.  \n\nLAR uses an Emergency Management Organization, known as Incident Command System (ICS), to respond and manage incidents.  The ICS has a hierarchical (chain of command) structure.  The  Incident Commander has the highest authority during an emergency.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position in the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, which are defined in the ERP.  The ICS is expanded or contracted to meet the needs or requirements of an emergency.  As the scope and complexity of an emergency expands so does the Incident Command System.\n\nThe refinery has a three-tier emergency activation system in place.  A Level 1 emergency is defined as an event, which can occur at a local work area (e.g., a unit), with minor consequences to health or property, which would not have an impact on the other units in the refinery.  A Level 1 emergency may be  handled by the personnel available on the unit.  A Level 2 emergency is a refinery emergency that would not require assistance from"

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n- Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n- Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n- Pressure relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n- Atmospheric pressure relief devices\n- Valves to isolate the process (manual and automatic)\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature, etc.)\n- Diking to contain liquid releases\n- Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n\nRelease Mitigation\n- Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n- Trained emergency response personnel\n- Personal protective equipment (protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n- Blast resistant control rooms\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the past five years, there have been two incidents that met the RMP 5-Year accident release reporting criteria:\n\n1.\tOn February 25, 2020, a fire occurred at the Carson Light End Depropanizer (LED).

The science of Human Factors is used to remove hazards, improve safety, and reduce the number of incidents in the work place.  \n\nThe human factors program established by Marathon Los Angeles Refinery have three main considerations:  a) ergonomics; b) cognitive human factors - matching design and procedures with cognitive capabilities and characteristics of the operator; and 3) safety culture.  \n\nA two-phase approach is used to address these considerations.  The first approach is reactive and involves investigating incidents from a Human Factors perspective.  The second approach is proactive and involves evaluating the work place for human factor issues.  This approach is taken when conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) studies, Management of Organization Change (MoOC), major change(s) identified from the MOC process, HCAs, and Operating and Maintenance Procedures reviews.
