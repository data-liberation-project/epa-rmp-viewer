Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the \ncontractor is carried out.  Follmer Development Inc. has a strict policy of informing the \ncontractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  \nContractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental \nrelease of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\n\nFollmer Development Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the \nlast 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release \nduring this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\n\nFollmer Development Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental \nreleases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including \nadequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response \nagencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and \nserviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place \nwithin our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nVentura County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency \nplan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various \nelements of our accidental release prevention program.  Employee suggestions, vendor \nequipment updates, process re-engineering, and hazard analyses are some of the major steps we \nwant to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are continuously being \nimplemented."

      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Manufacturing Facilities\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Follmer Development Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental \nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass this facilities primary activity is the filling of aerosol \nproducts.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include \nIsobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] and Propane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for a \npropellant for aerosol products.  Propane is used for a propellant for aerosol products.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] that is expected to be present in this \nfacility based on process/operational  requirements 10747.80 lb. while Propane is expected to be \npresent at our facility in a maximum quantity of 7972.20 lb..\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's \nOCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the \nchosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class \ninvolves a catastrophic release from A70/A55.  In this scenario, 18000 lb. of Flammable \nMixture: Propane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is released. It is assumed that the entire \nquantity is released as a vapor, which finds an"

Under worst case weather conditions, the \ncalculated distance of 0.21 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a \nrelease from A70/A55.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The \nscenario involves the release of 18000 lb. of Flammable Mixture: Propane, Isobutane  [Propane, \n2-methyl] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the \nflammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.13 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances \ninvolves a release from Warehouse.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud \nExplosion.  The scenario involves the release of 720 lb. of Flammable Mixture: Propane, \nIsobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] in 10 minutes. The release is also controlled by active mitigation \nmeasures that include sprinkler system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum \ndistance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.04 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\nSpecific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and \nconstructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections \nbriefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary \nsource.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFollmer Development Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the \nchemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated w"
