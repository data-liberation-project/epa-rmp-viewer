      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBenton/Washington Regional Public Water Authority (formerly Benton/Washington County Water Association) is a regional water supply entity with an intake pumping station on Beaver Lake, a water treatment plant featuring coagulation, filtration, chlorination, lime for pH balance, and polymer to assist the coagulant, and a flouride feed system.  A carbon feed system at the WTP and a potassium permanganate sytem at  the intake rexist but have not been needed though the date of this submittal.\n\nA 2 MG clear well, two storage tankls (5 MG and 2 MG) and a booster pump station are connected by some 70 miles of transmission and connector pipeline.  The Authority serves seven cities, two County RDAs and three special districts; each entity having a  Diorector and Alternate on the Board of Directors.\n\nTwo of the Authority's facilities are subject to creation of a Risk Management Plan; the water treatment plant and the booster pump station.  Gaseous chlorine is dispensed from each of these locations.\n\nThis plan assumes (Worst Case ID 1) that as many as five (5) of the one-ton cylinders \"fail\" in such a way as to release all of their contents within one minute.  Public notice, evacuation of residents within the projected plume and immediate contact to the Benton County Emergency Services unit are the prescribed steps in the ER Plan.  Once the situation is under control, AR Department of Health must be officially notified.  Additionally, any extended \"out-of-service\" status of the water treatment plant requires that each Member agency be notified so that alternate water sources or water conservation measures may be instituted by them.\n\nGaseous chlorine is not subject to mitigation controls, and its density keeps it close to the ground, directing it to the lowest parts of local topography.  Dispersion due to dilution in the atmsophere and oxidation by sunlight represents the only practical means of disposing of the escaped gas.\n\nEarly detection and timely notifia"

      "SummaryText": "ction of nearby residents in the projected plume path given topographic reelities along with the wind diorection and speed are the keys to minimizing harm to residents.\n\nDetection is by audio alarm and frequent inspections of the chlorine cylinders and the diffusing manifold system.  The on-duty Operator makes these inspections during the course of his/her shift.  Any abnormality in any part of the chlorination application process is immediately evaluated and action to correct is taken by the Operator.  If the situation can not be controlled, the provisions of the ER plan and this RMP are activated."
