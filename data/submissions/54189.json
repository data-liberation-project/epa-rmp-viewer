In the event of a release, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and minimize the impact of the release on the employees, local residents, and the environment of the area.\n\nAg Service in is a ag wholesale business that sells fertilizers to dealers for resale for crop production by farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in the plant to be combined with water and phosphorus componds for mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum amount that can be stored at our facility is 53,000 lbs. or approximately 12,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia. The maximum amount  unloaded or present at our facility at any one time would be 53,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. Ag Services, Inc. also has a maxium of 139,000 lbs of Aqueous Ammonia.  \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the entire storage tank in a gas release over 10 minutes.  The amount released would be 53,000 pounds and would result in an end point of 1.63 miles and would effect a population of 117.   The Fertilizer Institute\u00bfs Degadis model was used for the end point calculations.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be a pipe release over 2 minutes.  The total amount released would be 11,908 pounds and would result in an endpoint of 0.83 miles and would effect a population of 30.  The Fertilizer Institute\u00bfs Degadis model was used for the end point calculations.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for Aqueous Ammonia would be the release of the entire storage tank in a liquid that slowly turns to a vapor release over several hours.  The amount released would be 139,000 pounds and would result in an end point of 0.66 miles and would effect a population of 19.
