              "Description": "     The Town of Somerset Water Treatment Facility prior to acceptance of any Chlorine Contanier checks each container for chlorine leaks with ammonia solution and visually inspects each container for any transport damage.  Each container once accepted is then placed within the chlorine container storage room and logged in on the chlorine inventory sheet,noting the date received and the container identification number.  All container transactions are noted on this inventory sheet(a copy is attached).\n     Two trained personnel are required for any unloading or changing of chlorine containers, each checking every phase of the operation and verifying the process.  Each time a chlorine container is connected to a vacuum regulator each operator checks all connections for leaks with ammonia solution prior to placing the Chlorine container on line.\n     The Town of Somerset Water and Waste Water Departments also provide all employees a chlorine safety training seminar annually which is conducted by the chlorine supplier, in which all employees who handle chlorine are required to attend.  Also, the Somerset Fire Department has one of their members (usually a ranking member) also in attendence.\n     All chlorine equipment is placed on an annual maintenance program which is completed by the equipment representative who is trained in the maintenance and operation of this specific chlorine equipment; and is also trained in chlorine handling and chlorine safety.  All equipment including \"standby\" equipment is inspected and tested each year.  All equipment is tagged with its inspection date and its next inspection service date.  All equipment which has been in operati is removed from service, taken apart and inspected  , then is rebuilt using new parts and tested per manufacturers instructions.\n     The water treatment facility operators check the chlorine contanier storage room every two hours during their shift.  Entrance to this room is from the outside of the facility, where both doors are locked and chained to prevent unauthorized access.  The area is marked and posted \"Danger Chlorine Gas\", and both the Chlorine container storage room and the chlorinator feed room have been equipped with a ventilation system which was redesigned and upgraded in 1994, when the treatment facility was expanded and upgraded.  A chlorine detector is also installed in the chlorinator feed room which monitors the air in the Chlorine container storage room.  This monitor is also maintained at the same time and frequency as all of the chlorine feed equipment.\n     The treatment facility also constantly updates all MSDS sheets and provides the employees and opportunity to review these sheets.  MSDS sheets are also posted in both the chlorine feed room and the chlorine container room.\n     By examining the chlorine process at this facility and identifing any hazzards associated with this process,our facility has planned and taken appropriate action to improve the safety of our employees, the community, and the environment.  The Somerset Water Department has performed a Process Hazard Analysis on the Chlorine system within this facility to identify hazzards, identify credible human errors and or equipment failures which could lead to a accidential release, and to better understand what prevention steps need to be taken to prevent such from occuring.  A copy of this analysis is attached.  This analysis will be updated and reviewed when necessary or whenever the process or part of the process is changed.  A revalidationof the process hazard analysis will be preformed every five years,in conjunction with the risk management plans.\n     Any and all incidents or \"near miss\" will be promptly investigated by the department, and all factors will be evaluated.  A copy of the report used for this task is attached.\n     By adherence to these measures both the employee and the community will be provided with a safe environment.",

      "SummaryText": "The Town of Somerset Water Treatment Facility is located on County Street in Somerset Massachusetts(at the intersection of Wetstone Hill Road).  At this Water Treatment Facility water is processed at an average delivery of approximately three(3) million gallons per day for the community.  Liquid chlorine is received in one-ton containers for use in the facility in its process to disinfect drinking water.  Containers are shipped in pairs(two tons) to the facility,and the maximum amount stored in the facility would be just under three tons (6,000 pounds).  Ordering of chlorine containers is done when two containers are empty, at that point two additional containers full of liquid chlorine are received.  All containers both empty and full containers and the one in use are included on an inventory sheet to track the amount of chlorine stored within the facility.\nChlorine is used at a rate of approximately sixty five pounds per day in its treatment process, and is always withdrawn as a gas.  Cylinder received and the unloading of cylinders and their connection to the feed system performed by two (2) individuals who have been trained in chlorine handling, chlorine safety, and follow developed policies and procedures for these tasks.\n     During the construction and renovation of the Water Treatment Facility in 1994, new chlorine feed systems were installed which rely on system vacuum allowing chlorine gas to be withdrawn from the ton containers; and the use of vacuum regulators which are directly mounted to the container valves, thus eliminating the use of chlorine whip connections and the potential problems associated with them.  Also, by utilizing the regulator mounted directly on the cylinder no pressurized chlorine gas will be present away from the cylinder, also any break in system vacuum will stop the withdrawal of chlorine gas at the container.\n     Startup training on all components of the chlorine feed equipment was conducted during 1994 when the treatment facili"

At that time all employees were trained on this feed equipment along with system operation, chlorine safety,and troubleshooting.  The department also has an annual service contract to provide for the repair and preventative maintenance of all components of the chlorine feed system including chlorine detection equipment.  The department also has on hand an ample supply of repair parts and preventative maintenance kits to service all of the system components.\n     Periodic safety audits are performed by the Town of Somerset Fire Department along with safety reviews by the Towns Insurance Carriers.  The Somerset Water Department is committed to provide a safe and environmentally sound operation for both its employees and members of its community,by providing annual safety training on the use of chlorine,and its risks and hazzards; and by developing and following safe and proper and approved procedures along with department policies, and continuing to review these with our workforce the risk of accidential release at this facility is minimized"
