Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of New Century FS are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.   \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 84,000 pounds.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4. Five year accident history.    \n\na. 11-20-09 O-ring gasket on the transfer pump failed releasing 1288 lbs. into the air.\n   It has not caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at  \n   the facility, It did cause one off-site injury, and did resulted in evacuation of \n   four people two employees and two off-site.\n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.   \n\na."
