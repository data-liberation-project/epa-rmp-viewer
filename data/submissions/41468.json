The stationary source is the Coke production facility.  The RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia-which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system in this facility contains anhydrous ammonia.  This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1.  It is subject to OSHA?s PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\n\r\nThis facility follows a rigorous RMP & Process Safety Management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  The program is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119.  Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM & RMP programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community and the environment.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\n\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  The plan will be provided to the local LEPC for review.\r\n\r\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nThis facility operates an anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant.  Reciprocating compressors are used in the refrigeration system.  Engine room electrical classification is NEMA-1.\r\n\r\nThis ammonia refrigeration system contains interconnected sub-systems:\r\n1. Medium-temperature\r\n2. Condenser System\r\n3. Compressor medium-temperature system.\r\n\r\nMajor refrigeration equipment includes high-stage compressors, high-pressure receiver, accumulator and evaporative condensers.\r\n\r\nThe high-stage compressors pull ammonia vapor from the accumulator and compress it.  This vessel has connection with high-stage compressors, medium-temperature evaporators an"

      "SummaryText": "d with the high-pressure liquid piping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evaporative condensers use axial fans in a draw-through configuration.  High-pressure ammonia-vapor flows from the high-stage compressors to the evaporative condenser where heat is removed. The vapor is condensed into a high-pressure liquid using air and water flowing over the outside of the condensing pipe coils.  High-pressure liquid from the condenser is drained to the thermosyphon pilot-receiver and overflows to the controlled-pressure receiver. The condenser has connections with the compressor discharge lined, the thermosyphon pilot-receiver, and the purger.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITIGATION MEASURES\r\n\r\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off.  \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nThe hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.  The definitions and parameters for the release scenarios are based on the ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration? as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\r\nParticipation ? The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole. As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents.  Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and e"

Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information.  These are available to employees that operate, maintain or repair the process equipment or piping.  There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID?s), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer?s manuals.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis ? A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the ?What-if? technique.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact.  The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\r\n\r\nStandard Operating Procedures ? SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot and evaporator.  Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID?s, task flow diagrams and step-by-step procedures with specific warn"

The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\r\n\r\nTraining ? All employees are who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual?s role in the emergency plan.\r\n\r\nContractors ? This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contactors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system.  The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with ammonia process that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor?s safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review ? Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems.  This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity Audits ? The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits ?
