The facility was constructed and began operations in 2001.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold, freezer, and dock storage.  Typical operating conditions range from 1.6 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 166 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n?    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP);\n\n?    OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n?    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\" \n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nThe Castle & Cooke Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.

      "SummaryText": "or example, the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility operates in accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Program (RMP), and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.\n\n            \n\nEngineering Measures:\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: emergency shutdown switches that kill power to the engine room equipment (located outside each Engine Room door), an emergency pressure control system to relieve pressure from a high pressure suction line to a lower pressure suction line, relief valves on all pressure vessels, continuous ventilation (controlled by a thermostat), and emergency ventilation in the Engine Room to prevent explosions. The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere has been one accidental release of ammonia at the facility in the past five years (December 2006 - December 2011).\n\n \n\nAt approximately 1:00 pm on April 18, 2007, an employee from Castle & Cooke Cold Storage noticed an abnormal discharge of a liquid substance spilling from the manifold of the under floor heating system located on the eastern portion of the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility located at 4100 Bandini Boulevard in Vernon, California.  An apparent failure occurred within the shell and tube heat exchanger, causing the high pressure ammonia gas to mix with the low pressure propylene glycol, causing a rupture to a 3\" PVC slip joint fitting on the un"

The Castle & Cooke Cold Storage refrigeration operator was instructed by the Senior Vice President of Operations via cell phone to turn off the glycol circulation pump and close the hot-gas valve supplying the high pressure ammonia to the heat exchanger.  Once these measures were conducted, further spillage of the contaminated propylene glycol was terminated. Waste run-off from the glycol spill was contained on the property of Castle & Cooke Cold Storage.  A Hazardous Material clean up team was contracted by the building's owner, Baker Commodities, to remediate the glycol and liquid ammonia spill. After reviewing the daily morning refrigeration log earlier that day and comparing the machine room level after the spill, it was estimated that only 15 to 20 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released that afternoon. \n\n\n\nThe failure of the heat exchanger resulted in a direct replacement of the original unit, as well as repairs to the propylene glycol PVC manifold.  Risk measures have been implemented to install pH monitoring sensors in the glycol circuit, sending a supervisory signal to Castle & Cooke Cold Storage's monitoring service, ADT Security. Dual pressure relief valves were also installed on the Heat Exchanger after the incident.\n\n\n\nA visiting truck driver, who was parked in the area of the manifold at the time of the release, experienced nausea from the ammonia odors. He was eventually transported to a local area hospital for observation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nCastle & Cooke Cold Storage maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nCastle & Cooke Cold Storage personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Operations Manager.  The Operations Manager will contact the Chief Engineer, Castle & Cooke Safety Director, and Senior Vice President of Engineering to evaluate and ascertain the significance of the leak.  If the ammonia leak is considered minor and/or minimal, the repair will be conducted by the Castle & Cooke refrigeration mechanical staff.  An outside refrigeration contractor may be contracted to further assist in the potential repairs to the equipment pertaining to the ammonia system.  For major ammonia leaks, emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis Study was performed on October 8, 2001 at the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility, and was revalidated on December 20, 2006, and again on December 19, 2011. These studies generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Castle & Cooke Cold Storage facility located in Vernon, California.
