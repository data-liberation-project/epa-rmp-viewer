They are directly involved in the several Teams which oversee the Safety Programs. These Teams are composed of a broad cross section of the employees.\n\nEpsilon maintains a fully staffed Safety department. The Emergency Response Team has fully trained volunteer members on duty around the clock.\n \nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEpsilon manufactures Polypropylene, one of the most useful of Plastics. It is inert, non-toxic, non-hazardous and burns poorly.\n\nEpsilon employs 140 people at the Marcus Hook site and is currently expanding. These people work in the Tri-State area with many residing in the Townships surrounding the facility.\n\nPropylene is the major hazardous material on site. It is the chemical, which places Epsilon in the RMP Program. Similar to Propane in characteristics, it is flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air. It is handled under pressure in both its gaseous and liquid forms. \n\nOther chemicals on site include:\n* Ethylene, which is a normally gaseous hydrocarbon. It is flammable and potentially explosive when mixed with air.\n* Propane, which is similar to Propylene in characteristics.\n* Hydrogen, which is handled in both its' gaseous form and as a cryogenic liquid. It is flammable and potentially explosive when mixed with air.\n* Nitrogen, which is handled as a gas and as a cryogenic liquid. It is potentially a sufficant and can cause severe frost burns in its' liquid form.\n* Catalyst components, which have low toxicity levels.\n* A Pyrophoric liquid which burns with contact with air and reacts with water.\n* Organic Peroxides which could react violently if exposed to heat.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe release of 130,000 pounds of Propylene followed by a "

The release would have an affect for approximately 0.40 miles. The estimate residential population in this area is 40.

The top was torn off of a storage silo by the ignition of flammable gases. No Injuries occurred and no Off-Site Consequences were involved. Silo damages were in the $300,000.00 range.\n\nA second incident occurred, which was not reportable under RMP guidelines. Flammable gases were releases from a pressure safety device. The gases were ignited. There were no injuries, no Off-Site Consequences and no significant damage (approximately $1,000.00).\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs In Place:\n\n* Automatic Emergency Feed Shutdowns.\n* Automatic and Manual Sprinkler Systems.\n* Centralized Alarm System.\n* Fully Trained Emergency Response Team.\n* Communications Systems: R"
