We at the Dallas Water Treatment Plant (Dallas WTP) use chemicals, too. For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe drinking water to the citizens of Dallas. Storing large qualities of chlorine can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do providing the community with safe, disinfected drinking water. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Dallas accidental release prevention policy involves proven technology and staff that has been well trained on operation and maintenance practices. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The Dallas WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine storage containers. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Dallas WTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site people. To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurri"

Ellendale Rd. in the City of Dallas in Polk County. The plant, located on an acre of property, is about 1.2 miles west of the city limits of Dallas. Water is supplied to the plant via Rickreall Creek from Mercer Reservoir. Water from the plant services Dallas and Ellendale Water District. Treatment processes used at the plant include preliminary screening, flocculation and settling, sand bed filtration and chlorination. The Dallas WTP produces 8.5 million gallons per day (MGD).\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine in two, 1-ton steel storage tanks containing a maximum in each tank of 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The facility has the capacity to hold two more 1-ton containers, but seldom does so. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the RMP regulation. \n\nChlorine gas is injected from chlorine containers into a solution that is used in a variety of plant processes, primarily for final effluent disinfection. Gaseous chlorine, pulled from a storage container by an ejector, flows through chlorinators that control and measure the flow of gaseous chlorine. The gaseous chlorine is mixed with plant effluent water, and the solution is distributed to several locations in the plant. Chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage area and in the chlorination room. Other alarms include feed and evaporator malfunction and low bulk storage tank weight. These alarms are annunciated at the chlorine control panel, as well as, in the case of a leak an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.\n\nThe bulk storage tanks and the chlorinators are enclosed in separate rooms. Each room is equipped with a ventilation system. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided outside the storage room and on the second floor as is the chlorinator room. Sel"

Visitors and contractors must be approved by Dallas WTP staff prior to entry into the facility. The plant is manned during the day, year round, and alarms notify on-call staff during off-hours of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations. \n\nThe chlorination facilities are also provided with emergency generators. These generators are started manually after a power loss and will supply power to the leak detectors, lighting, and ventilation systems.\n\nNo chlorine releases that could cause a safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Dallas WTP during the last five years. \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\nDallas WTP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Chemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, should a leak occur when changing chlorine supply tanks, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\nDallas WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n?    Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors\n?    Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n?    Use of inherently safe vacuum supply system in which pipe component leaks bring air into the system rather than discharging chlorine to atmosphere\n?

This information was compiled from numerous sources and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data about these substances. This information includes chlorine background information, Material Safety Data Sheets, and chlorine reaction chemistry.\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process. Specifications for each process are collected in one place for easy reference. Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\nWe also have procedures in place that are triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 2009, a detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted with plant staff, engineering, and administrative staff for the regulated process. The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers. The PHA technique used was the What-If / Checklist study, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The PHA was lead by knowledgeable person on the PHA method and the team included persons knowledgeable in the chlorine process.
