      "SummaryText": "The Iowa-American Water Company East River Station is a water treatment plant that provides drinking water to customers in the area of Davenport, Bettendorf, Riverdale, and Panarama Park, Iowa. To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every tap, the plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.  The concentrated form of chlorine is liquefied and stored in shipping containers. Before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to the air.\n\nIowa- American Water Company is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through emergency management agencies.\n\nIowa-American Water Company has completed an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case release scenario.  As required by the EPA RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel or container as a gas in ten-minutes.  The regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance. \n\nFor the offsite consequence analyses, the \"endpoint\" concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protectiv"

EPA RMP*COMP offsite consequence analysis software was used to estimate distances for offsite impacts.\n\nA major release of the magnitude represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of chlorine transport containers (they are designed to withstand transportation mishaps) and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at chlorine suppliers and the East River Station Plant.  In fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\nA \"credible worst-case\" scenario was selected as the alternative release scenario. This scenario assumes that the unloading yolk/flexible connection to a transport container is completely severed when performing leak testing and the resulting vapor release occurs within the building.  The mitigating affects of the building were considered by applying a factor of 0.55 was applied to the release rate modeled for an unmitigated release as described above. This means that the chemical release rate from the building is 55% of the release rate from the source. This factor is recommended for modeling the effects of building mitigation in the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.   The installed scrubber was not considered in this scenario but would reduce the impact of any release significantly.  The scrubber is designed to remove up to 78 lbs./hr of chlori"

As with the worst-case scenario, actual distances and directions vary with terrain and weather conditions.\n\nTo ensure a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the East River Station Plant maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine. The prevention program has twelve elements designed to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nIowa-American Water Company is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Operations Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  Other key plant supervisory staff also have clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nOur prevention measures include the use of:\n\n( chlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n( scrubbers designed to contain and remove a major chlorine release;\n( process safety information to document the safe process design;\n( process hazards analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n( operating procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\n( maintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacturer's "

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major chlorine release that could have had adverse effects on the public.\n \n In the event that a chlorine release does occur, the East River Station Plant has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the regional emergency management agency and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the local emergency responders who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release. \n \n We continually work to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect our employees and the community we serve. The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices.
