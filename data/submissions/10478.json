Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we store propane, and transfer the propane into portable cylinders.  Propane, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergence responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substance and process considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage of propane and the transfer of same into portable cylinders. The propane is used by Air Products customers for a variety of applications such as a fuel for heating and metal processing.     The propane is delivered into the propane storage by the propane supplier.  Portable cylinders are filled individually by weight on a scale.  There is no chemical reaction involved.  The process is strictly the transfer of a liquefied petroleum gas fr"

      "SummaryText": "om a large storage container into smaller individual portable cylinders.  The capacities of the cylinders range from approx. 20 pounds up to 100 pound cylinders. \n\nDuring this process, no products or wastes are either created nor consumed.  The fill system is equipped with a recycle valve that directs the propane stream back to the storage tank when each cylinder is filled.   As a result, no propane is vented to the atmosphere during the normal operation of the system.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the pure, single product, Propane, a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), which is a flammable gas.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility is:\n\n7 176,746 pounds of the flammable gas, Propane\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\" (WCS), as defined by the EPA, associated with the release of flammable in the Propane process at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the entire Propane tank inventory of 106,335 pounds. The entire  Propane tank inventory of 106,335 pounds is assumed to be released and ignited,  resulting in a VCE.   The VCE would affect off site receptors. Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ACS) for the Propane at this facility is a VCE resulting from the failure of a transfer hose from the delivery truck to the Propane storage tank, resulting in a release rate of  1121  pounds per minute, based on the tanker pump output of 62 gallons per minute. TheVCE would affect off site receptors.  \n\n\n\n4.

This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of, flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based upon OSHA\"S HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAS First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Prince Georges County Fire Department for fires related to the Propane process.   Periodic drills are conducted with this agency to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures. \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the pant design and operating procedures."
