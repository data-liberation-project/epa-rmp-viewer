They are, the Aqueous Ammonia Production unit where Anhydrous Ammonia and Ammonia Solution > 19% are used (including on-site storage and drumming) and the Bleach Production Plant, where bleach is manufactured from chlorine. \n\n\n\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Production Unit produces 29% Ammonium Hydroxide by mixing Anhydrous Ammonia with de-ionized water.  This process also includes storage of ammonium hydroxide in tanker trucks while on-site while awaiting shipment off site or for use in the drumming operation.\n\n\n\nIn the drumming operation ammonium hydroxide manufactured in ammonia plant is drummed into containers for shipment offsite. \n\n\n\nBleach is manufactured by mixing chlorine and sodium hydroxide and water in a specialized reactor.  After the bleach is manufactured, it is stored and shipped off-site in bulk quantities and/or is drummed for shipment. This process is used infrequently during the summer months when aqueous bleach availability is low. When aqueous bleach is available, the facility dilutes strong concentrations of bleach onsite for shipment off-site in bulk quantities. \n\n\n\n\n\n Have Process Hazard Analyses been completed and subsequent recommendations developed? \n\n\n\nBorden & Remington has completed comprehensive Process Hazard Analyses for the production units that use listed chemicals above thresholds found in Sec. 68. Piping and instrument diagrams and other safety information were used to consider deviations from design intention. Recommendations were developed and were tracked toward completion.\n\n\n\nHave operating procedures been developed/updated for processes utilizing the listed chemicals?\n\n\n\nBorden & Remington has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for process perf"

      "SummaryText": " where RMP chemicals are used.\n\n\n\nWhat steps is Borden & Remington taking to minimize the risk at its facility?   \n\n\n\nBorden & Remington installed a new scrubber that replaced the existing scrubber that was installed where the chlorine rail cars are stored at the facility.  The scrubber is only used in emergency situations when and if there were a release of chlorine gas from the railcars.\n\n\n\nAdditionally in order to reduce the risk of chlorine use Borden & Remington has opted to produce 15% by volume sodium hypochlorite solution by purchasing 19% by volume bleach solution and diluting it to 15% solution.\n\n\n\nAs an example, in 2017 Borden & Remington converted 17,489,515 pounds of as pure sodium hypochlorite from 19%by volume (15.4% solution by weight) solution diluted to make 15% solution by volume (12.5% solution by weight).  Given the stoichiometry above it takes two atoms of chlorine to make one molecule of sodium hypochlorite.  The molecular weight of chlorine is 35 and the molecular weight of bleach is 77.4. The amount of chlorine required to make 17,489,515 pounds of pure sodium hypochlorite is 15,817,390 pounds.  Similarly it takes two molecules of sodium hydroxide to convert two atoms of chlorine to one molecule of sodium hypochlorite.   The molecular weight of sodium hydroxide is 40 and, it takes two molecules of sodium hydroxide to make one molecule of sodium hypochlorite.  The amount of sodium hydroxide required to make 17,489,515 pounds of pure sodium hypochlorite is 18,086,320.  Therefore by substituting 19% sodium hypochlorite solution diluted to 15% solution for the chlorine and sodium hydroxide reactants  the company reduced its chlorine usage by 15,817,390 pounds as well as reduced it sodium hydroxide usage by 18,086,320 pounds.  \n\n\n\nThe company still maintains the Bleach Plant and continues to process chlorine albeit at a much lower rate due to supply chain issues that occasionally arise.  The amount of liquid chlorine processed to make sodium hypo"

      "SummaryText": "chlorite in 2017 was 3,593,539.  \n\n\n\nBorden & Remington has embraced the RMP regulations and integrated it into the culture of the Company. It is this mindset that will result in the continued diligence towards the maintenance and improvement of the Company's Risk Management Program and subsequent lower risk to the environment and the community. As time passes the components of the RMP will become stronger and more effective as they are reviewed and revised. It is Borden & Remington's commitment to facilitating the evolution of an ever-improving RMP that is the catalyst that will result in the significant and permanent reduction of risk. \n\n"
