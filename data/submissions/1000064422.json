Facility Policy.\r\n\r\nIf an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Fillmore County Emergency Management, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the production of anhydrous ammonia as an agricultural product. The ammonia production process uses natural gas and ambient air as production inputs. The natural gas and ambient air react to produce anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n3. Five-Year Accident History.\r\n\r\nNo accidents have occurred within the most recent five-year history.\r\n\r\n4. Emergency Response.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program established by Fortigen Geneva does not allow for personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances. Fortigen Geneva has identified resources mitigate, control, and dispose of a release. The local emergency response agency (Fillmore County Emergency Management) will be relied upon to inform the public about the release. Fortigen Geneva has developed an Emergency Action Plan outlining actions taken in the event of an accidental release of regulated substances as well as in the event of natural disasters. The Emergency Action Plan is provided below for reference.\r\n\r\n5. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nFortigen Geneva has implemented environmental, emergency, and safety programs. Equipment maintenance checks are completed that assist in the ability for Fortigen Geneva staff to respond to emergencies. Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) and Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPP) plans have been prepared and implemented. Updates will be completed as needed to ensure compliance and effectiveness. Fortigen Geneva has developed a Prevention Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for a Program Level 3 facility. \r\n\r\nThe facility conducts weekly and monthly training as p"
