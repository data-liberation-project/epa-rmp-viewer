PO BOX 69\nWOOD Lake, MN. 56297\n\nFor further information contact Roger Hansen, General Manager, PH Number 507-485-3153\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Equity Elevator & Trading Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia. If any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n  2. Facility Information\n\n       The  primary activity at the facility is the  storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers and pumping ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\n       Annhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n        The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 132,000 lbs. in our 30,000 gal tank and our nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n   3. The worst - case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n   a. The  worst-case release scenario for annhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n   \n    b. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n     4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n          The facility has implemented  the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and  Handling of Anhydrous "

In addition, Minnesota Dept. of Ag Rules.\n\n       5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n         a. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: \n              have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our   knowledge, have resulted  in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or  environmental damage.\n\n        6. The emergency response program.\n\n             The facility has:\n\n          a.  A  written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n           b. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n            c. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n        7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n             Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific annhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
