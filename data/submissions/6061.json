      "SummaryText": "Sterling Plumbing has adopted twelve Environmental Principles that reinforce the company's long-standing policy to incorporate environmental and safety considerations into all of its activities.  The principles are as follows:\n\n7 Conserve energy and natural resources through their wise use and reuse.\n7 Strive to eliminate pollution at its source.\n7 Focus on the recycle or sale of every scrap of non-hazardous waste.\n7 Minimize the generation of hazardous waste.\n7 Dispose of remaining waste safely and responsibly.\n7 Enhance the land and air through careful land planning and the planting of trees and other flora.\n7 Design, operate and inspect our facilities to protect the health and safety of associates and the public.\n7 Make health, safety and the environment a priority in developing new products and processes.\n7 Recognize and respond on a timely basis to associates and community concerns regarding our products and operations.\n7 Participate with government and regulatory agencies in the development of responsible environmental laws and regulations.\n7 Anticipate prudently and comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.\n7 Periodically audit and assess compliance with these policies and submit our findings to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Sterling Plumbing Searcy, Arkansas facility manufactures stainless steel sinks.  These sinks are annealed in a nitrogen and hydrogen atmosphere.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one (1) 10,000-gallon storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is piped from the storage tank to dissociators to generate nitrogen and hydrogen for use in the annealing oven.\n\nThe worst case scenario is the accidental release of all ammonia stored in the storage tank.  This scenario is highly unlikely.  While still unlikely, a more plausible alternative scenario would be a brief two-minute release of ammonia from the safety relief valve on the storage tank.  Both the worst case and the alternative release scenarios have off site consequences.\n\nThe s"

      "SummaryText": "torage tank was installed in 1967.  There are two dissociators at the facility; the dissociator fueled by natural gas was installed in 1966, and the other (electric) was installed in 1993.  Inherent to the design of the storage tank and dissociators are safety valves, pressure and temperature controls, and other devices that minimize the possibility of a release.  The ammonia storage tank is equipped with safety relief valves to prevent excessive pressures in the tank.  This reduces the potential for atmospheric failure of the tank.  The ammonia tank, piping and dissociators are regularly inspected and maintained.  Since ammonia has a very strong odor, all leaks would be detected even if the released volume were very small.\n\nThere has not been any anhydrous ammonia accidents in the past 5 years at this facility.\n\nThe emergency response for this plant has been coordinated with local emergency response professionals (White County Local Emergency Planning Commission, and the City of Searcy Fire Department).  In addition, affected employees are trained on the safe working practices for anhydrous ammonia, and all facility personnel are trained on the evacuation routes to take in case of an emergency.  All changes to improve safety have been implemented."
