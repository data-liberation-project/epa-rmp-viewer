This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1)  To save lives.\n\n2)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3)  To protect the environment.\n\n4)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nBama Foods, LTD. maintains an emergency response team whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the OSHA PSM Standard and the EPA RMP Rule, as well as to incorporate any facility and personnel changes. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\n\n\nThe Bama Foods, LTD. facility prepares frozen bakery products for distribution.  The facility utilizes an industrial refrigeration system in order to conduct operations, and ammonia is used in the system uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 9\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 180-200 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.  The total ammonia inventory is 52,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nIn order to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility has developed an accidental release preventio"

The system has been designed with several safety features to prevent a release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors throughout the facility which will alert plant personnel in the event of an ammonia detection.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history (January 2012 - January 2017) showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  \n\n\n\nWithin the course of the last five years, the facility has experienced small ammonia leaks from the system, however none of these incidents meet the criteria discussed above.  As required, these incidents are investigated following the procedures of the Incident Investigation program to determine the root cause of t"

The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained throughout the year.  All Emergency Response Team members receive HAZWOPER training and are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nBama Foods, LTD. has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A Compliance Audit was completed in January 27, 2015, and a PHA Revalidation was completed in May 16, 2014.  In addition, a PHA was performed in 2016 to address the system expansion per MOC Record No. BF-77.  Recommendations were generated as a result of these analyses to improve safety at the facility.\n\n"
