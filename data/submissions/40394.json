The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the\nequipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional\ncheck to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally\nready.\n\nA PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that\nprevention program requirements are identified and implemented as appropriate.\n\nMechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M) has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent\nsystems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can\nperform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide\na basis for training.\n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within\nacceptable operating limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible"

Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) Eagle Point Refinery\nincorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M) has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence /exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) confined space permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry and (5) a hot and safe work permit procedure to control spark-producing activities. These and other safety procedures, along with the training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M) has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\n\nChanges are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing\ncontrols have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment\ninformation, procedures and other affected process safety information are updated as required.  In addition, training is provided as required for those employees whose job responsibilities"

These programs include detailed operator training,\nqualification and refresher training program, annual safety training and consideration for safety in the design,\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance of our refinery processes.\n\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M)'s practice is to determine appropriate administrative and mechanical controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of regulated substances.  However, if a release were to occur, our response team members are well trained to respond and control the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M) Eagle Point Refinery, located in Westville, New Jersey, operates a number of different process functions to\nproduce petroleum products such as gasoline, fuel oil, propane and butane from raw crude oil. The facility has fixed inventories\nof butane and propane and uses chlorine, which is used for disinfection and treatment of cooling water at the refinery cooling towers. Through the course of routine process operation, a flammable mixture stream is generated containing covered\nflammables. The entire refinery has been classified as a single process, with multiple production units. This classification\nensures that all regulated chemicals that meet the criteria defined by the EPA Risk Management Program are included in this\nprogram.\n\nNo Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated flammable substances were identified at the refinery.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Sunoco, Inc.
