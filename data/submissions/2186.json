RMP RULES APPLY BECAUSE THE FACILITY UTILIZES CHLORINE VAPOR TO DISINFECT ITS WASTEWATER AND MORE THAN 2500 POUNDS ARE KEPT ON SITE.  THE FACILITY PLANS TO ABANDON THIS SYSTEM BY THE YEAR 2002 AND USE ULTRAVIOLET DISINFECTION AT THAT TIME.  THE FACILITY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FACILITY RECOGNIZES THE POTENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF CHLORINE.  TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS CONCERN, MANAGEMENT HAS DEVELOPED AN EXTENSIVE MANUAL WHICH DELINEATES SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES TO INSURE CHLORINE SAFETY.  THE STRENGTH OF THE MANUAL LIES IN THE DETAILED MEASURES DEVELOPED TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS AND RELEASES.  IN DEVELOPING THIS MANUAL, THE PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS TEAM HAS ENSURED SAFE OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH 40CFR68 AND 29CRF1910.119.  THE FACILITY IS THEREFORE RMP AND OSHA PSM COMPLIANT.  PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO INSURE THOROUGH EMPLOYEE TRAINING.  TRAINING INCLUDES A REVIEW OF PROPER OPERATING PROCEDURES INCLUDING PERSONAL PROTECTION AND SAFETY PROCEDURES.  TRAINING IS GIVEN BY BOTH SPECIAL TRAINING SEMINARS PROVIDED BY THE SUPPLIER AND HANDS ON INSTRUCTION.  THE FACILITY MAINTAINS BOTH A TRAINING SCHEDULE AND REFRESHER TRAINING INSTRUCTION.  MECHANICAL SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS WHICH FOCUS ON SAFETY ISSUES HAVE ALSO BEEN DEVELOPED, AS WELL AS SCHEDULES FOR THOROUGH MECHANICAL INSPECTIONS OF THE SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM IS INSPECTED A MINIMUM OF TWELVE TIMES PER DAY.  ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES INCLUDE PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS, MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE, START UP REVIEW, COMPLIANCE AUDITS, INCIDENT INVESTIGATION, EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION, HOT WORK PERMITS AND PROCEDURES FOR CONTRACTORS. IN THE REMOTE CHANCE OF AN EXTREME SITUATION, EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN PREPARED.  THE FACILITY H"

RESPONSE MEASURES INCLUDE SAFETY MEASURES, FIRST AID, DIVISION OF AUTHORITY, REMEDIAL ACTION PLANNING AND, IF NECESSARY, PUBLIC NOTIFICATION.

THE WORST CASE INVOLVED A SINGLE ONE TON CYLINDER AS REQUIRED, WHILE THE ALTERNATIVE INVOLVES A PIPE BREAK WITH FOUR CYLINDERS CONNECTED.  EACH SCENARIO INVOLVED OFF SITE CONSEQUENCES."
