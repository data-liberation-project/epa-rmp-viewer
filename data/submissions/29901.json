BCP had operated the facility until April 2002 when all process units were shutdown.  De-inventory of all chemicals was completed by September 2002.  In December 2002, GVC acquired the facility from BCP.   As required by 40 CFR 68.155, GVC is including with the Risk Management Plan Submission the following Executive Summary.  \n\nGVC is currently preparing the facility for operation. GVC intends to operate two processes: the Vinyl Chloride Monomer via Ethylene (VCM?E) which also include ethylene dichloride production, and eventually GVC will operate the Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) plant. GVC is performing all appropriate equipment testing, HAZOPs, Pre start-up Safety Reviews (PSSR?s), and all other startup procedures to ensure a safe start up of the VCM-E plant. The PVC plant is not operational and will remain down for the next six to twelve months. GVC will resubmit this Risk Management Plan prior to start up of the PVC plant as well as incorporate any appropriate updates since start up of the VCM-E process.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGVC has a commitment to protection of the health and safety of its employees and the general public. It is GVC policy to provide the safest workplace possible for our employees while also minimizing to the fullest extent practical any impact on the neighboring community, which includes striving to eliminate accidental releases.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes; providing proper training to personnel; having up-to-date operating procedures; and implementing an effective maintenance and m"

However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release in order to minimize to the fullest extent any possible impact on the neighboring community.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe GVC facility is located in Sections 3, 49, and 50 of Township 9 South, Range 2 East and Section 11 of Township 10 South, Range 2 East in Ascension Parish. The site is approximately 22 miles southeast of Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the intersection of Louisiana Highways 73 and 30 near the rural town of Geismar, LA.  The facility began operation in 1961 under the direction of Borden Chemical, Inc. and was operated continuously until the entire plant was shut down in April 2002.  In December 2002, GVC acquired certain assets of the complex.  The plants that will be now operated by GVC include vinyl chloride (including ethylene dichloride) and  polyvinyl chloride.  The remaining plants which included urea, urea-formaldehyde concentrate, acetylene, anhydrous ammonia, , formaldehyde,  industrial gases (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), methanol, and air separation products (oxygen, nitrogen, and argon) are not owned by GVC and will not be operated by GVC.\n\nThe plant uses or produces the following RMP regulated substances in quantities above the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.130:\n\nToxics:        chlorine and hydrogen chloride\nFlammables:      propylene and vinyl chloride\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at GVC?s Geismar facility.   Because the processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident preve"

Please note that due to time constraints, GVC addressed the request for the ?last date? on which a particular activity was completed by entering the most recent date for completion of that respective activity as of the final version of that section of this report. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nGVC employees participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees are involved in the writing of procedures and development of the training materials that accompany them.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the process safety management program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each process safety program element.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that addresses process safety and employee safety issues.  Employee teams meet on a regular basis to review and develop safety procedures, training programs, emergency response procedures, investigate process safety related incidents and report to the plant management safety team.  Monthly meetings between companies operating within the Geismar complex are held to discuss common issues relating to safety and emergency response.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nGVC has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees have been advised of the location of the process safety information"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards such as those associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nGVC has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential process safety hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted by a team comprised of individuals who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures are made when the team finds such measures are necessary.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, GVC will update and revalidate the hazard analysis results at least once every five years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates will be documented and forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution documen"

Temporary and emergency operating procedures are developed for each case prior to commencement of the operation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nTraining\n\nGVC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in both safety issues and plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After an operator demonstrates (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, the operator can work independently.  In addition, all operators will receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training will be conducted at least once every three years.  All training is documented for each operator, including, the means used to verify that the operator comprehended the training.\n\nContractors\n\nGVC routinely employs contractors to work on or near process equipment.  Additional contractor work force is present during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Contractors are provided both plant-wide and unit-specific training using computer based training programs. The program includes a written test that requires an 80% passing score.

The long-term contractors participate along with Geismar Vinyls Company employees as members of the safety teams tasked with the development of procedures, audits, accident investigation and training.  \n\nIn addition to the safety training, procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find.  Each contractor employee is provided with a process overview and information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to beginning work. GVC evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. Plant personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR?s)\n\nGVC conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or major facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that necessary training, safety features, procedures, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  PSSR's for all operations that will start"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, as appropriate, or Management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment until the actions are completed.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. GVC incorporates quality assurance measures (e.g., purchasing specifications and inspection procedures) into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nGVC has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker"

Examples of these include: (1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nGVC has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, and equipment information, as well as procedures and drawings are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nThe management of change program is designed to allow anyone in the system, operations or maintenance, the ability to initiate a MOC.  Employees have been trained concerning the various elements that would constitute a change such as parts, procedures, operating conditions, etc.  The MOC change form provides an abbreviated version of the pre-startup review.  Management of the documents and approval to proceed are controlled at the department level.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nGVC promptly investigates all process safety related incidents.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar "

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. When necessary, short-term interim measures are taken until the permanent fix is implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained on file for at least five years to supplement the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHA?s and PHA revalidations.  GVC is in the process of implementing a non-conformance report database and an employee improvement program.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the process safety program is functioning properly, GVC periodically undergoes an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to the plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained on file.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at GVC have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  Emergency response program changes are administered such that informing and/or training affected personnel is accomplished prior to implementation of the change.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Geismar facility is coordinated with the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) network which is comprised of local industries and the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Geismar facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response.
