It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency first responders and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants. \r\n\r\nPrimary Activity\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of the Victoria Surface Water Treatment Plant (VSWTP) is water treatment to produce potable water.\r\n\r\nUse of Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nChlorine is used to treat surface water and is used in the water distribution network to maintain chlorine residual in the drinking water. Ammonia (anhydrous) is also used in the treatment process.\r\n\r\nQuantities Handled or Stored\r\n\r\nChlorine: 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nAmmonia (anhydrous): 43,800 lbs.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario ID #11 is the failure of a 2,000 lb. container full of Chlorine gas.  The release rate of a 10-minute release is 110.0 lbs./min.  In a wind speed of 1.5 m/s the Chlorine will disperse to a density no longer toxic to the health of the public in approximately 2.48 miles.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario ID #12 is the failure of a 43,800 lb. container full of Ammonia (anhydrous) gas liquidfied by pressure.  The release rate of a 10-minute release is 4,380.0 lbs./min.  In a wind speed of 1.5 m/s the Ammonia will disperse to a density no longer toxic to the health of the public in approximately 2.48 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\r\n\r\nAn alternative release scenario ID #13 is the failure of a flexible connection releasing Chlorine gas.  The intensity of a 60-minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because of the container being stored in a building.  The equivalent release equals 191 lbs. o"

In a wind speed of 3.0 m/s the chlorine will disperse to a density no longer toxic to the health of the public in approximately 0.31 miles.\r\nAn alternative release scenario ID #14 is the failure of a transfer hose releasing Ammonia (anhydrous) gas liquidfied by pressure.  The intensity of a 60-minute release is mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because of the container being stored in a building.  The equivalent release equals 5,040 lbs. of Ammonia (anhydrous).  In a wind speed of 3.0 m/s the ammonia will disperse to a density no longer toxic to the health of the public in approximately 0.31 miles.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe VSWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  City staff has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other program elements of the Rule.  As a result of a Hazard Review at the plant, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe VSWTP has not had a significant chlorine release in the past five (5) years. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe VSWTP has developed an Emergency Response Program in coordination with the community.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe following recommendations were made in the previous RMP submittal.  Some have been implemented and are noted as complete and others are in the process of being budgeted and implemented. \r\n\r\n\r\n* We have upgraded the VSWTP to include leak detection and alarms\r\n* We have upgraded our operating and maintenance (O&M) procedures, and have elaborated on procedures more prone to human error.\r\n* We will require each operator to be trained on the plant's O&M\r\n* We are in the process of developing and implementing a chlorine supplier audit program.  We need emergency container repair kits and need to maintain equipment. Currently there is not a pre-shi"
