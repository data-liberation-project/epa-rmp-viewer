This commitment to safety is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including forklift training.   Chase Products Co. maintains a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) listing in the warehouse for use by facility employees. Annual fire safety inspections are performed by the LaGrange Park Fire Company.  In addition, Chase Products Co. coordinates emergency response measures with the LaGrange Park Fire Company.  Chase Products Co. also utilizes Verlan Fire Insurance Company to perform annual inspections of the warehouse facility.\n\nChase Product Co. manufacturers an extensive list of aerosol type products.  Some examples of these products include personal hygiene (i.e., spray deodorants, hair spray, etc.) and residential use (i.e., glass cleaner, insecticides and spray paints). The aerosol cans are stored within Chase Products Co.?s finished goods warehouse.  The warehouse is used only for finished product storage.  No manufacturing or processing is conducted at the warehouse.  The maximum number of finished aerosol products stored within the warehouse at any one time is 3,182,000 16-ounce cans.  The average net weight of these finished aerosol products is 12.25 oz/can and the average amount of propellant in each can is 20%.  The total amount of propellant stored within the warehouse is 487,200 lbs.  Solvent-based aerosol paint products, meeting NFPA-4 rating, comprise approximately 34% of the total inventory.  The remaining 66% of the inventory is comprised of water-based aerosol products that so not meet the NFPA-4 flammability rating.\n\nChase Products Co.?s finished goods warehouse is not subject to OSHA PSM standards, however, the warehouse operations fall under Program 2 requirements according to EPA?s Risk Management Program.  No additional RMP processes were identified at the site.\n\nChase Products Co. has had no accidental releases of flammable g"

The plan?s purpose is to establish emergency and notification procedures to be followed in the event of chemical, environmental or other emergencies.  Personnel are trained as emergency coordinators and responders, and Chase Products Co. conducts tabletop and hands-on emergency response drills annually.  In addition, the plan is reviewed at least annually and is amended as necessary.  Some of the response actions are coordinated with the Broadview Fire Department and the LaGrange Park Fire Department.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the facility include continued training of employees on the emergency response contingency plan."
