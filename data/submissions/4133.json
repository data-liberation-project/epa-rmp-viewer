              "Description": "The system configuration for this chlorine supply arrangement is to feed chlorine gas from one or more manifolded ton containers.  Chlorine gas is fed through pressurized piping up to the plant chlorinators where chlorine gas is vacuum regulated to an injector.  Each chlorinator contains a vacuum regulating valve.  Downstream of the vacuum regulating valve, chlorine gas is handled in piping at sub-atmospheric pressure.  At the injector, the gas is mixed with the raw water/effluent to be treated.  The vapor pressure of the resulting chlorine solution is low enough that a potential release of the solution does not pose an  accident risk.  A leak in the pressurized piping would resultin a chlorine release that would require the tank valve to be closed to prevent overexposure to personnel in the area.  Because chlorine is handled under vacuum downstream of the chlorinator, a piping leak in this portion of the system will result in air intrusion rather than a chlorine release. The vacuum regulating valve closes upon loss of vacuum, and as piping downstream of a rupture would still be under vacuum, a pipe rupture in this portion of the system would only result in a diffusion leak of the chlorine in the piping between the chlorinator and the rupture.",

The Department has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of its chlorine storage, handling, and use, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes and improves existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\nThe E.A. Fairbarn Water Treatment Plant contains 16 chlorine tank containers that are used in the disinfection process.  \n\nConsequence modeling was conducted to determine the release distances from the site. The worst-case release scenarios represent a release of the largest vessel's contents when full over a 10-minute release period. \n\nThe alternative scenario consists of a release of chlorine through a break in the container flexible connector (also known as a pigtail).  This failure of the pigtail could be caused corrosion (known as chloride stress cracking) or through mechanical damage.  This postulated failure would result in a chlorine vapor release from the broken connection.  It was assumed that the container was full and that the release rate was constant (chlorine temperature remaining at the ambient temperature).  This is a conservative assumption.  In a real release scenario, the temperature of the chlorine would drop rapidly from the chilling effect that occurs when a compressed, liquified gas is depressurized.  This would cause the release rate to diminish over time.\nRelease time was conservatively estimated to occur over ten minutes.\n\n\nThe Department of Utilities has assigned personnel responsibility for implementing elements of CalARP/RMP.  The Water & Sewer Superintendent is ultimately responsible for implementation of the CalARP/RMP Program, auditing for compliance, and implement"

Implementation of the program is done in a continuous effort to improve safety at all Department facilities.\nThere have been many recent examples of improvements to the chlorine handling system.  They include:\n\n7 Completion of recommendations related to a seismic evaluation of the Sacramento River Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n7 Consideration of continuous telemetry from well sites to measure if a release has occurred. Construction of this monitoring system is scheduled to begin in Spring 1999.\n\n7 Consideration of less hazardous disinfectants such as calcium hypochlorite at the well sites instead of chlorine. There is an ongoing pilot project utilizing a calcium hypochlorite tablet feeder.\n\n7 Completion of recommendations from the PHA revalidation of all chlorine handling systems.\n\nThe Department strives to implement the prevention program in a timely manner and anticipates that all elements would be completed by July 1999."
