Regulated substances handled at the facility include hydrochloric acid (37%) and ammonium hydroxide (29%).  Hydrochloric acid is delivered by tank wagon to either a 5,000-gallon tank at the facility or to drums.  Ammonium hydroxide is delivered by tank wagon to either a 7,000-gallon tank at the facility or to drums.\n\nPuritan maintains a detailed emergency response plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 and 25 PA Code 264, Subchapter D (264.51 through 264.56).  The Vice-president of Operations serves as facility coordinator and incident commander for implementation of the emergency response plan. Employees are trained to respond to accidental releases at the facility.  The plan is coordinated with the LEPC and included in the community off-site release plan.\n\nPrevention measures for the HCl tank include the following:\n\n?Hydrostatic tank and water head testing\n?Continuous tank level indicator\n?High level alarm interlocked with tankwagon supply line\n?Conservation vent releasing to acid scrubber\n?Continuous process tank headspace pressure monitor\n?Diked area with floor sensors interlocked with a pump that automatically starts pumping to a 10,000-gallon outdoor containment tank.\n?Two1,600-gallon elementary neutralization tanks inside the building to neutralize any spilled acid that has been collected.\n?Two anti-syphon holes on the tank fill tube to prevent backflow.\n?HCl vapor sensor that continuously monitors the ambient facility air for HCl vapor and alarms at PEL concentration\n\nPrevention measures for the ammonium hydroxide tank include the following:\n\n?Hydrostatic tank and water head testing\n?Continuous tank level indicator\n?High level alarm interlocked with tankwagon supply line\n?Conservation vent releasing to ammonia scrubber\n?Continuous process tank headspace pressure monitor\n?Dike with capacity to contain 110% of process tank con"

All process  operations vent to a scrubber.  Operators responsible for moving or loading drums are trained in the safe operation of the forklifts both in the classroom and operating the vehicles.  In the event of a leaking or punctured drum outside of a diked area, operators are trained to use containment materials such as soda ash to prevent the spread of the release.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the Vice-president of Operations serves as the facility coordinator responsible for activating and overseeing the emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Lehigh County LEPC.  There have been no accidents involving the regulated substances at the facility in the last five years."
