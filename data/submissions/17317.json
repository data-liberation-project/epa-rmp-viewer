In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals or combination of these activities.  Any groups of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nThe Auburndale facility is a meat processing, freezing and storage facility.  Our facility uses ammonia in an industrial refrigeration system to maintain specified temperatures in various freezers, coolers and meat processing areas.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is the only process subject to the Risk Management Legisl"

In addition, there is a computer control system that monitors temperatures, and the atmosphere for leaks.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 18,000 lbs. of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80% of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten minute release.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and the auto-dialing system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nRelease from a relief valve on the recirculator would result in a release of 2379 lbs. of ammonia over a period of forty-five minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This relief valve was chosen as an alternative scenario because it is the only other likely place for a significant release.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:  it is highly unlikely that the pressure in the vessel would ever reach the relief pressure, the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; and the emergency response plan and equipme"

We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and the fire department.  The facility is equipped with a siren to warn plant personnel of an emergency.  The last emergency response drill at the plant was on Tuesday, October 6, 1998."
