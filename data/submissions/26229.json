The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Corydon are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Corydon Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry fertilizer, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The facility also handles grain, seed, pesticides, and feed.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 216,709 pounds. The storage tank has a capacity of 30,000 gallons. The facility has (16) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and (3) 550 gallon tank applicators for product distribution. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.14 miles.\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3\u00bf transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,638 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.59 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Prog"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has;\n\n\ta. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\t   Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 for the notification of \n\t   employees and the evacuation of the facility;\n\n\tb. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n\t   planning and community right-to-know information as\n\t   required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n\t   OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n\t   planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
