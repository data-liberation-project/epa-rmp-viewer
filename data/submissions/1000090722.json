The Borger Plant is located in Borger, TX, and is situated on approximately 60 acres. The plant was initially built by Phillips Petroleum and began operating in 1944 as the Philtex Experiment Station. The Philtex Experiment Station became the Philtex Plant and underwent a major expansion in 1959.\r\n\r\nThe plant produces a variety of specialty chemicals such as organo-sulfur compounds, high purity hydrocarbons, solvents, diversified organic chemicals, and aromatic polymers. These products are primarily intermediates which customers use to produce finished consumer products such as plastics, solvents and odorants. Since the original RMP filing, the use of allyl alcohol and piperidine have been discontinued and removed from this report. Chemicals used at the facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity include flammable mixtures which may contain butane, 1,3-butadiene, ethyl chloride, propylene,1-butene, 2-butene, ethyl mercaptan, 2-methylpropene, isobutene, isopentane; and toxics such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and methyl mercaptan. Note that in the Off-site consequence analysis, some of the releases were reported as 25 miles in the submittal, even though RMP*Comp predicts a distance to endpoint of >25 miles. This follows the guidance listed in \"RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis\" Section 1.1  \r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Management at the Borger Plant complies with the requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation.
