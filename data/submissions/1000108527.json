Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. \nBased on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."

      "SummaryText": "hinery rooms for shutting down the refrigeration systems. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the refrigeration machinery rooms. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. Both CC-I and CC-II refrigeration machinery rooms are installed with automatic crossover valves that allows pressure to be relieved from high side to low side in case of emergency situations. All relief valves are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\nAccording to Crown Cooling personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nCrown Cooling facility is a Non-Responding facility. Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, the incident will be reported immediately to the RMP Program Coordinator and designated Emergency Responders as outlined in emergency response program. The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n3.5.6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accident"

      "SummaryText": "8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details.\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for the refrigeration system is provided in Chapter 8 of the RMP Binder.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nCrown Cooling facility maintains a release prevention program to prevent or mitigate releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix 16 - Incident Investigation of the RMP Binder.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration systems. Qualified outside refrigeration contractors are used for maintenance other than minor procedures. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There is an emergency shut-off switch outside all three mac"

CC-I facility has a refrigeration machinery room housing reciprocating and screw compressors.\nCC-II facility refrigeration system is composed of fixed refrigeration equipment including screw compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, flooded type evaporator coils and diffusion tank. Flooded type evaporator cooling coils provide cooling for one large pre-cooling room with two zones, one smaller pre-cooling room and one cold storage room which was added in November 2014. Facility has refrigeration machinery room housing three screw compressors with thermosyphon oil cooling, high pressure receiver and dump transfer vessel. The suction accumulator is located on the refrigeration machinery room roof.\nGloriAnn refrigeration system equipment includes reciprocating compressors, low-pressure receiver recirculator package with ammonia pumps and oil pot, high-pressure receiver, evaporative condenser, cold room evaporators, and diffusion tank. The facility has a refrigeration machinery room housing reciprocating compressors and low-pressure receiver recirculator package.\nIce Generator Trailer is owned by Crown Cooling company and composed of a screw compressor, evaporative condenser, low pressure receiver, ammonia pump and an ice maker. \nThe facility leases portable vacuum cooling systems (one full-car and one half-car vacuum tube and refrigeration trailers) from Western Precooling Systems (WPS) seasonally.\nThe total ammonia charge for all the refrigeration systems is approximately 60,744 lb. Both CC-I (25,408 lb) and CC-II (21,236 lb) refrigeration systems have over 10,000 lb of ammonia in the system which requires EPA RMP compliance. GloriAnn system has 5,000 lb of ammonia, Ice Generator Trailer 1,500 lb, full-car vacuum cooling system 4,550 lb and half-car vacuum cooling system 3,050 lb.\nSee Chapter 8 Appendix"

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCrown Cooling facility conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response.\nOn-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nCrown Cooling uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. The ammonia system is used for fresh produce and citrus cold storage, pressure cooling, hydrocooling and ice generation. There are five (5) separate refrigeration systems (processes) at the Crown Cooling facility. These are: Crown Cooling I (CC-I), Crown Cooling II (CC-II), GloriAnn, Ice Generator Trailer, and Vacuum Cooling System. CC-I is the largest system with the potential of greatest off-site consequence.\nCC-I facility refrigeration system is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed equipment includes cold room evaporators and pressure coolers (forced air evaporators), pressure vessels, screw and re"
