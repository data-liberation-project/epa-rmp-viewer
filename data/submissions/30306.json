Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTwin Lake Chemical is committed to safety and the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances to the environment.  The use of Phosgene, Chlorine and Phosphorus trichloride in our organic chemicals manufacturing facility is operated and maintained in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented release prevention programs and emergency response policies in order to preserve and protect the health of employees.  These programs and policies also serve as protection of human health and the environment of the communities surrounding Twin Lake Chemical.  \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur Lockport facility manufactures organic chemicals through the use of such regulated substances as phosgene (COCl2), chlorine (Cl2) and phosphorus trichloride (PCl3).  COCl2 is supplied to the process from 1-ton DOT-51 cylinders for use as a reagent to make a variety of similar organic acids.  Each acid manufacturing process is completely separate, therefore only one cylinder or 2,000 pounds of COCl2 is part of a covered process at any time.  We purchase PCl3 in bulk quantities and store it in a 3,500-gallon tank, where it is pushed with inert gas to the process.  COCl2, Cl2 and PCl3 are the only toxic chemicals regulated under the RMP Rule by Part 68 that Twin Lake Chemical has on-site as part of a process.  Twin Lake Chemical has no flammable substances regulated by Part 68.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        D. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur prevention program follows the standard set forth by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management under standard 29 CFR 1910.119, and takes a proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of regu"

Our program includes the following steps and programs that lead to successful accident prevention:\n\n -  Process safety information\n -  Process hazard analysis\n -  Operating procedures\n -  Training\n -  Mechanical Integrity\n -  Management of change\n -  Pre-startup review\n -  Compliance audits\n -  Incident investigation\n -  Employee participation\n -  Hot work permit\n -  Contractors\n\nAs part of our general prevention program, we have integrated chemical-specific prevention steps that help minimize the possibility of any leak of a hazardous substance that poses a potential danger both onsite and/or offsite.  These steps greatly reduce risk:\n\nInspections - Regular inspections are performed on all process equipment to assure that the probability of failure is minimal.  Through constant maintenance and careful monitoring of all operations and equipment, Twin Lake Chemical can prevent potential harm to employees and the surrounding environment by discovering an accident before it happens.\n\nPersonnel - Twin Lake Chemical maintains high standards for its employees in their ability to monitor and operate the onsite processes.  Extensive training and experience in plant operations makes our employees our most important asset in maintaining safety onsite and preventing accidents.\n\nTechnology - Twin Lake Chemical uses advanced technology in its processes to automate and control precise process conditions.  Further, this technology also monitors deviations in these process conditions that include leaks or that could produce a leak.  Any deviations that could potentially result in a release are immediately corrected if possible or otherwise shutdown.  We also have a monitoring system that detects a release of either COCl2 or Cl2 in the process areas and sounds an alarm to alert employees.\n\nEmergency Response - It is a vital part of Risk Management to minimize the effect that any release of a regulated substanc"

We maintain an extensive response program for onsite accidents that pose a potential harm to employees and to offsite public receptors, including local residences.  Our program keys in on stopping the release, getting the right people to the scene quickly, and notifying offsite public receptors that could possibly be affected.  This plan is coordinated with the Lockport Fire Department, Public Dispatch (911), and the Niagara County LEPC.\n\nThese steps all coincide to manage the use of hazardous substances and prevent releases.  Our facility is committed to its programs that minimize the potential for any accidents and releases of a hazardous substance.  We strive to improve safety onsite at all times and operate at or above our own high standards for safety.\n\nE. Five-year Accident History\n\nWe are required by the RMP Rule to report all accidental chemical releases of regulated substances that meet or exceed the reportable quantity and keep them on-file as part of this Risk Management Plan.  Further, we are required to keep on-file all accidental chemical releases that have occurred in the last 5 years.\n\nAs a result of Twin Lake Chemical's programs on safety and accidental release prevention, we have had no reportable releases in the past 5 years, as of June 20, 1999 involving substances covered under Part 68.\n\nIf such a release should ever occur, following the implementation of emergency response program procedures, a formal investigation will be conducted to identify and correct the cause(s) of the incident.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency situation, Twin Lake Chemical maintains a written emergency response plan to respond in an orderly, efficient and safe manner.  Our emergency response plan provides key background, planning and training for the handling of and responding to releases of regulated substances.  The plan also defines procedures for proper notification of off-site public rec"

The main objective involved in the implementation of this plan is the protection of workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTwin Lake Chemical conducts Process Hazard Analyses (PHA's) that develop a list of suggestions for the improvement of process safety.  These PHA's are performed every 5 years or when a process is changed, whichever comes first.  The list of suggestions produced from the PHA is used to help improve safety for the employees, the pubic and the environment by reducing the risk of potential releases of regulated substances and emergency situations."
