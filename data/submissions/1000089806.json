Dodge, IA\nRefrigeration System Risk Management Program\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees that BHJ USA, LLC located in Ft. Dodge, IA is complying with OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals, In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\tOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\tBHJ USA, LLC is a facility in Ft. Dodge, Iowa which is a pet food processing and cold storage plant.  The facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems located at the Southeast end and the Northwest end of the building, both providing cooling and freezing capabilities.\nThe Southeast system is operated as a single-stage system.

The low temperature ammonia liquid flows across the freezer evaporators where it picks up heat from the product, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the evaporators to the accumulators via a suction header.\nVapor from the low temperature accumulator is fed to compressors. During the compression phase, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the compressors to an evaporative condenser where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a high pressure liquid.  The high-pressure liquid is collected in a controlled-pressure receiver.  The liquid collected in the controlled-pressure receiver provides liquid make-up for the accumulators and provided liquid to the cooler and dock.\n\nThe Northwest System is operated as a two-stage system.  On the low stage portion of the system, a low temperature accumulator operating at \u009640\u00b0F pumps liquid to plate freezers located in the plate freezer room.  The plate freezers are designed to maintain a \u009635\u00b0F temperature.  The low temperature ammonia liquid flows across the freezer plates where it picks up heat from the product, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plate freezers to the accumulator via a suction header.\nVapor from the low temperature accumulator is fed to low stage compressors.

Dodge, IA requires all associates to be trained in safe evacuation and notification procedures in cases of actual or drill emergencies. Training shall include escape routes, notification of appropriate response agencies, instructions on activating a building fire alarm system and what should be done after evacuating a building. The evacuation alarm and emergency evacuation procedures will be tested no less than once per year. The decision of when to practice evacuating the building will rest with the Plant Manager, Jeffrey L. Tschosik. Arrangements have been made to coordinate BHJ USA, LLC\u0092s Emergency Action Plan and applicable emergency services with the following local agencies:\n\nFt. Dodge LEPC \n515-955-6748\n\nFt. Dodge Police Department\n402-573-1426\n\nFt. Dodge Fire Department\n515-573-2323\n\nUpon discovering an emergency situation, all employees shall immediately notify their shift supervisor or the Maintenance Department using the phone, vocally or wireless phones. The supervisor of the affected area should immediately contact the shift Maintenance personnel to determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, the Maintenance Department will notify the Shift Supervisor. The shift supervisor will sound an evacuation alarm, and then determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area and will be relayed to the Employees.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the even"

Once everyone has evacuated the facility and arrived at their designated meeting area, a head count must be conducted by the Shift Supervisor to account for missing people, including visitors and/or contractors in his/her area. \nMaintenance employees who work with the ammonia system or respond to releases are allowed to work with the Haz Mat personnel to take offensive actions to stop a release. In the event of an emergency release of ammonia it will be necessary for some specifically assigned and properly trained employees to remain in work areas that are being evacuated long enough to perform critical operations. Before a maintenance employee enters a release area, they must first test the concentration of the release by using an ammonia detector. They must also operate in pairs. If the isolation is their within reasonable capabilities they may isolate the leak and shut down the system if needed.\n\nIn response to an ammonia release, BHJ USA, LLC will not respond to releases of hazardous chemicals in an offensive manner. The facility does not have any employees trained at the HAZMAT Technicians or First Responders Operations Level.  However, in the case of a minor ammonia release, designated maintenance personnel are allowed to isolate or maintain the release.\n\nBHJ USA, LLC in Ft. Dodge, IA has not had any accidental releases to report."
