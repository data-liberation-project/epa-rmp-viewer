      "SummaryText": "PURPOSE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN RESUBMISSION / UPDATE\n\nStolthaven Houston Inc. is updating the facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP) in January of 2010 to revise the operating scenario for a regulated toxic substance already present at the facility above the applicable threshold quantity in a newly covered process.  The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n- Updating the RMP pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 68, Section A? 68.190(b)(4), due to Stolthaven Houston Inc. commencing the storage and associated marine parcel shipments of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) in the facility's P Tank Farm in existing Internal Floating Roof (IFR) Storage Tank P50-5 and/or existing IFR Storage Tank P15-41 for the first time above the threshold quantity for VAM of 15,000-pounds.  \n\n - No other changes are proposed at this time.  \n\n\nA?68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes related to bulk chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the citizens of the surrounding communities.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Stolthaven Houston Inc. has designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and the substances regulated by 40 CFR Part 68 that are currently handled on-site\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of processes covered by EPA's RMP rule\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of improvements at the facility implemented to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, the environment, and company"

Bulk liquid products are received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal by various modes of transportation cargo containers that can include tank trucks, ISO tank containers, rail tank cars, barges, and/or marine parcel tankers (ships).  These products are stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and are subsequently transferred off-site through one or more of the above-referenced transportation modes.  Direct transfer of TDI from marine vessels to rail tank cars is also performed at Stolthaven Houston Inc. with no intermediate storage.  Stolthaven Houston Inc. currently has over 15-years of experience in the storage and handling of TDI.\n\nSimilarly, Isopentane, n-Pentane, and pentane blends are also periodically transloaded directly between land-based transportation containers (i.e. tank trucks, ISO tank containers, and rail tank cars) at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with no intermediate product storage.  TDI and VAM currently represent the only two RMP regulated substances at Stolthaven Houston Inc. that are present above their corresponding threshold quantities at all times.  Note that the Stolthaven Houston Terminal does not perform any chemical processing or chemical manufacturing operations on-site, and the company does not own nor ultimately control any of the bulk liquid products that are stored or otherwise handled at the facility.  \n\nOn April 13, 2009 Stolthaven Houston Inc. commenced the storage and associated marine transfers of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), a RMP regulated toxic"

After initial system commissioning via tank truck delivery, VAM has subsequently been received into the Stolthaven Houston Terminal via barges discharging into either of two existing 15,000-barrel capacity IFR Storage Tanks:  Tank A15-9 and Tank A15-10.  The stored VAM is then shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.  \n\nIn January of 2010 Stolthaven Houston Inc. will consolidate the terminal's existing VAM storage previously housed in IFR Storage Tanks A15-9 and A15-10 into either one or two different tanks at the facility, Tanks P50-5 and P15-41, that have been specifically prepared for this upcoming change to VAM service.  Storage Tank P50-5 is an existing IFR tank at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with a maximum working capacity of approximately 50,142-barrels, which corresponds to a maximum VAM storage capacity of just under 16,365,000-pounds.  Similarly, Storage Tank P15-41 is also an existing IFR tank at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with a maximum working capacity of approximately 15,179-barrels, which corresponds to a maximum VAM storage capacity of 4,953,600-pounds.  Tank P15-41 will initially be placed into VAM service in late January of 2010.  Tank P50-5, which represents the facility's worst-case VAM release scenario, will subsequently be placed into VAM service in the coming months.  \n\nNote that Storage Tanks A15-9 and A15-10 at Stolthaven Houston Inc. were recently gas-freed and cleaned of all residual VAM, and will be prepared for storage of a different substance that is not covered under the current 40 CFR 68 regulations.  As such, Storage Tanks A15-9 and A15-10 are no longer be covered processes under the RMP rules.\n\nEmployee training related to the specifics of VAM storage and transfer at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was first conducted in December of 2008 and then again in April of 2009 in prep"

Although current facility employees are experienced in the procedures necessary to safely handle VAM, additional safety training related specifically to VAM storage in P Tank Farm was conducted in December of 2009.  Specific topics covered during this employee review of safe VAM handling procedures included, but were not limited to, the following information:  product transfer modes and affected facility equipment, VAM technical and physical properties, inhibitor specifications and periodic verification, nitrogen blanketing to maintain low oxygen levels, special product hazards and warnings, required personal protective equipment (PPE), and environmental/regulatory considerations.  VAM has been successfully handled at Stolthaven Houston Inc. since April of 2009 without significant incident.  \n\nAs a result of the upcoming VAM storage project in P Tank Farm, piping modifications were recently completed in various facility manifolds and at Tank P50-5 to eliminate the use of hoses in VAM service to the greatest extent possible within the terminal.  Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems are also in the process of being upgraded to provide additional cooling water as-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving the facility's flammable liquid storage tanks.  Existing portable water delivery systems are adequate until such time as these permanent system modifications are completed.\n\nThe following chemicals presently handled at Stolthaven Houston have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nRegulated Toxic Substances (2):\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (CAS Number 26471-62-5) &\nVinyl Acetate Monomer (CAS Number 108-05-4)\n\nRegulated Flammable Substances (2):\n\nNormal Pentane (CAS Number 563-46-2)\nIsopentane (CAS Number 563-46-2), &\nNormal Pentane ("
