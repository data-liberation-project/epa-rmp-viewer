      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTampa Bay Fisheries Inc. currently operates a Shrimp processing facility in Dover, Florida.  This is primarily an agricultural/rural residential area.  The site is located immediately north of State Road 574, between Gallagher Road, and Macintosh Road.  Commercial properties are located along SR574 and agricultural/rural residential properties are located to the north.  Several small residential areas exist to the east and to the west of the site. Two reclaimed phosphate pits (north pond and South pond) are located on the western portion of the site and these are interconnected by a ditch system. \n\nTampa Bay Fisheries processes about 80,000 pounds of raw shrimp per day and produces a shrimp product for wholesale to markets and the restaurant industry. The TBF shrimp processing operation consists of storage, thawing and soaking, peeling, wash down and rolling tanks for product transfer within the facility.  Please refer to the bitmap picture included in the Risk Management plan submittal,  dated June 1999.\n\nTampa Bay Fisheries uses or stores for use in it's processes, chemicals which are listed as hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).    The chemicals reported  are 16,000lbs of Ammonia (anhydrous) and 67,000lbs of Propane gas. \n\nAmmonia (anhydrous)\nThe quantity of ammonia used requires Program Level 3 reporting.  As a result, a Process Hazard Analysis is provided which includes a worst case scenario and an alternative model for hazard assessment. RMP*Comp software was used to estimate the chemical impact. The hazard analysis is based on census and EPA data available through the use of Landview software (US Census and EPA).  The  population estimate is 8149 persons located within 2 miles of the facility calculated for a worst case scenario and  275 persons within a .20 mile radius for the alternative scenario.   The alternative model is based on a less severe and more probable event such as an occurrence of a valve or pipe rupture,"

The reported population estimate is 175 persons located within .3 miles of the facility calculated for a worst case scenario, and  20 persons within a .10 mile radius for the alternative scenario.   The alternative model is based on a less severe and more probable event such as an occurrence of a valve or pipe rupture which could result in  escape of flammable gas.  Under these conditions, the theoretical maximum loss of 1000lbs of propane is used.  The calculations are summarized as follows:\n\n\nThe processes listed herein had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)) within the past five years.  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases, however the plant safety procedures are subject to continual review.
