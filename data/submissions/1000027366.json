It is the City of Danville Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant's intent to enforce the policies and procedures presented in this document to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances or reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.\n\n\n\n1.0    POLICIES IN PLACE\n\n\n\nThe City of Danville's Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant complies with Clean Air Act and Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) air emissions regulations and has policies in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n\n\n2.0    SOURCE AND SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe facility is responsible for treating wastewater for the City of Danville (SIC Code 4952, NAICS 22131). Chlorine (Chemical Abstracts Services, CAS Number 7782-50-5) is used to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharging it into the Dan River. The City of Danville's Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant maximum storage of Chlorine is sixteen (16) 1-ton cylinders on site.  Sulfur Dioxide (CAS Number 7446-09-5) is used to reduce or eliminate the chlorine residual following the disinfection and prior to discharge into the Dan River.  The City of Danville maximum storage of Sulfur Dioxide is twelve (12) 1-ton cylinders on site.\n\n\n\n3.0    RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide involves the failure of a one-ton container releasing approximately 2,000 lbs of chlorine.  In this scenario, the chlorine is released over a ten-minute period at a rate of 200 pounds per minute (lbs/min).  The distance to the toxic endpoint the chlorine would travel, before dispersing enough to no longer pose a health hazard, is 1.3 miles.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide involves release through a 1/16 inch hole in the cylinde"

      "SummaryText": "r. The release rate is 10 lbs/min. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles.   This distance was limited by considering the enclosed building with a drain as a passive mitigation measure.\n\n\n\n4.0    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and, with this document, the Clean Air Act Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations.  The City of Danville's Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant relies on a system of equipment maintenance and periodic testing to prevent accidental releases. \n\n\n\n5.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe City of Danville's Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the last 5-years.\n\n\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe City of Danville's Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant is included in the City of Danville's LEPC's written community emergency response plan.  The facility relies entirely on local community emergency response teams to address releases.\n\n\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety.\n\n"
