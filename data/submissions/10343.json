The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance and a worst case flammable accident as a vapor cloud explosion.  Alternate scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general must also be presented.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release\n\nBecause of the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by farmers for application.  The RMP rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint.  \n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia is held in the cryogenic storage tanks.    This quantity can total 30,000 tons in each tank. Farmland also modeled the 200 ton pressure storage tanks in which warm ammonia is held for shipment and for use in facility plants.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that the entire amount of one full tank is released as a result of a catastrophic failure.  The weather conditions must be those which create the longest affected distance.  These unlikely events were modeled by a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events. \n\nIn the case of the Enid facility, the release of 200 tons of warm ammonia created the worst offsite consequence.  This is because the 30,000 ton storage tanks hold the ammonia at -28  degrees F inside a diked area which limits the size of the pool of ammonia.  The 200 ton pressure tanks hold the liquid ammonia at 40 to 60  degrees F which causes more rapid vaporization.\n\nIn addition, a worst case failure of a chlorine container was similarly mo"

Analysis of this unlikely scenario was completed as required by the rule.  Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and preclude such massive and improbable failures.\n\nWorst Case Flammable\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the worst case for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia synthesis loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis formulas.  Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small, especially considering the inert gases and steam in the mixtures.  Offsite impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nAlternate Case Toxics \n\n    Ammonia\n\n\"More likely\" release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are throughout the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.  Such events can include failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario, modeled with the DEGADIS model for this facility, is breaking off a 3/4\" vent and drain valve from the ammonia truck and rail loading system.  The modeled offsite impact distance is substantially lower for more reasonable, but still not necessarily likely release events.\n\n    Chlorine\n\nChlorine is used at several locations in this plant  to control algae and bacteria in the cooling "

It is used as a gas from one ton chlorine cylinders through an injection system to the circulating cooling water.\n\nThe alternate release scenario assumed is failure of the connecting tubing from the cylinder and release of gaseous chlorine.  This release and offsite consequence was modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion program.  \n\n    Flammables\n\nLarge volumes of flammable gases are handled throughout the plant, even though actual physical inventory is relatively low, given the quantity of inert gases and steam in the mixtures.  More likely flammable release events include failures of smaller pipes and lines or blowing relief valves in comparison to the large release contemplated in the worst case analysis.\n\nThe alternate scenario used was an extended blowing of the synthesis gas compressor relief valve due to a loss of reaction in the synthesis converter.  The relief valve lifts to maintain loop pressure while the synthesis compressor continues to send gas to the synthesis loop.  The time was extended to three minutes in order to vent enough gas to provide an off-site consequence.  The scenario also assumes no wind and that the gas cloud which consists of mostly hydrogen and inert gases stays intact.    The impact distance calculation for this event utilized the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis formulas.  More reasonable events result in minimal impact distances.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies.\n\n\n6"
