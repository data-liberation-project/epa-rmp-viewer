      "SummaryText": "Lake Mackenzie Municipal Water Authority supplies water to four towns and the lake is used for recreaction.  There is a housing area on the lake with some permanent residents - most of the housing is used on weekends.\n\nChlorine is the only hazardous material used at the water treatment plant.  Storage of the chlorine is in a sparsely populated area.  There is one house located within 1200 feet of the storage tanks.  With the prevailing winds blowing from sowthwest to northeast, this home and the housing area are in very low risk areas.  With the prevailing winds, chlorine would be carried over the lake, which would help dissipate the chlorine gas should a leakage occur.  Another saftey feature is the deep canyons surrounding the chlorine storage area.  \n\nIf there should be a leak from the chlorine storage tanks, all employees on duty are instructed to stay inside the office building and to notify local emergency teams for assistance to reduce possible health hazards.  This would include local law enforcement, Texas Highway Patrol, and rural fire departments.  \n\nSafety procedures would include blocking Highway 207, which runs northand south from Highway 287 to F.M. 146, until all chlorine gases have disipated.  The local game wardens will also be contacted to assist with emergency response teams.  The phone alert system will be activated for permanent and weekend residents living in the housing area.  Campers and fishermen will be contacted and directed to a safe area.  \n\nThe Lake Mackenzie Manager is aggresively seeking training programs that will expand their chlorine safety program.  Response checklists will be developed to insure all saftey measures are being followed.   Planned changes changes to im-prove safety include:  monthly safety programs, alert rosters, daily inspections of the chemical storage area by employees.  Onth each month the manager and water superintendent will inspect the hazardous chemical area.  Safety drills will be performed to test the al"
