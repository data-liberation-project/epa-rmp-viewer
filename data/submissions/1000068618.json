The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Itasca Cooperative Grain Company are committed to the prevention of any accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application fro crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 183,855 pounds, rounded to 180,000 pounds in our two storage tanks one 30,000 gallon and one 12,000 gallon.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nA. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,325 pounds, rounded to 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of  dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.7 miles.\n\nB. The alternative release scenario based of the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidential release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implimeted the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\n\nA.  There have been no accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any "

Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7.

There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
