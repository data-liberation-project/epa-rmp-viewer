      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWD provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\n\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWD in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWD currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Henry J. Mills Water Treatment Plant (Mills Plant).\n\n\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWD regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWD has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Mills Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\n\n\n\nMills Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the a"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.

Mills Water Treatment Plant (Mills Plant) is located at 550 E. Alessandro Boulevard in Riverside Hills, California.  The plant is situated west of Interstate Highway 215 and south of State Highway 60.  The facility was constructed in 1978 and covers approximately 256 acres.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the Federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Admi"

Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\n\n\n\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\n\n\n\nThe Chlorine Con"

Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by actuating the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\n\n\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.
