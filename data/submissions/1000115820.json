Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility's RMP and PSM programs are works in progress and are constantly being reviewed and revised. Operating procedures and PHA's are reviewed periodically. Incident investigations are initiated and recommendations are made and followed subsequent to any event that did or could have resulted in a release of chemical. The PSM program is audited by both internal and external teams. The findings of such audits are addressed. In order to stay abreast of the most current ammonia refrigeration safety news the company is involved in and monitors the proceedings of ammonia refrigeration associations and standards-setting bodies such as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the Industrial Refrigeration Consortium."

F. and +20 deg. F. suction, and condensing with evaporative condensers at 95 deg. F.  The system provides cooling for the entire cold storage warehouse areas and climate-controlled dock areas.  \n\nThe system is controlled via microprocessors with hot gas defrost control, compressor sequencing, and evaporative condenser fan and pump control.  The system is also capable of remote operation via modem and is capable of temperature monitoring and control.\n\nAn ammonia detection system is installed as part of the central control system and will monitor locations where ammonia refrigerant is present.

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis company operates a freezing and storage warehouse for the perishable food industry.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 20,512 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at The Pictsweet Company, Brownsville, Tennessee, facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation of perishable food products. This provides refrigerant temperatures of -20 deg, F. with the use of low suction compressors and provides temperatures of +20 deg.

Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nThe Pictsweet Company is committed to compliance with all federal, state and local laws on safety and health in the workplace.  To assist in providing a safe and healthful work environment for Associates, customers, and visitors, The Pictsweet  Company has established a workplace safety program.  This program is a top priority for The Pictsweet Company.  The Human Resources Manager and Facility manager have the responsibility for implementing, administering, monitoring, and evaluating the safety program.  Its success depends on the alertness and personal commitment of all.\n\nThe Pictsweet Company provides information to Associates about workplace safety and health issues through regular internal communication channels such as Supervisor-Associate meetings, bulletin board postings, memos, or other written communications.  A safety advisory group has been established to assist in these activities and to facilitate effective communications between Associates and management about workplace safety and health issues.\n\nAssociates and supervisors receive periodic workplace safety training.  The training covers potential safety and health hazards and safe work practices and procedures to eliminate or minimize hazards.  Each Associate is expected to obey safety rules and to exercise caution in all work activities.  Associates must immediately report any unsafe condition to the appropriate supervisor.  Associates who violate safety standards, who cause hazardous or dangerous situations, or who fail to report or, where appropriate, remedy such situations, may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nIn the case of accidents that result in injury, regardless of how insignificant the injury may appear, Associates should immediately notify the Human Resources Manager, the Facility Manager or the appropriat"
