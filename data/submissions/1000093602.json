The Facility serves the community by treating, on average, 5,000,000 gallons of waste water per day.The waste water is disinfected by the use of chlorine and dechlorined by the use of Sulfur Dioxide. The facility stores and maintains six 1 ton cylinders of Chlorine and four 1 ton cylinders of Sulfur Dioxide. All operators are trained on the safe use of 1 ton cylinders chlorine and 1 ton cylinders sulfur Dioxide pertaining to shipping, recieving, hook-up procedures, and chemical monitoring systems (sensors used for leak detection) in accordance with procedures and guidelines with in the Process Safety Managememt Plan. All personell at the Wastewater Treatment Plant are shown the primary and secondary designated meeting locations for evacuation during a Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide leak/spill. All staff are given an Emergency Response card. The Emergency Response Card includes emergency telephone numbers and basic instructions for operating a hand held radio.The first wastewater staff member to reach the designated evacuation point is responsible for notifying the City Of Lumberton Communication Department to dispatch the first responders to the designated evacuation location at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.The Lumberton Fire Department is the designated first responders.The facility has never had a release that has caused off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nOn March 16th 2020 a Chlorine relocation project began.  The point of application didn't change during this relocation.  The two main purposes for this relocation was to move the chlorine away from the operations building and the main entrance.  Also to move it closer to the point of application, previously it was approximately 200 yards from the point of application.  Now it's approximately 50 feet from point of application.  This also allowed us to abandon the original chlorine carrier line which is believed to "
