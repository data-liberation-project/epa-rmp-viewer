We at the Dallas Water Treatment Plant (Dallas WTP) use chemicals, too. For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe drinking water to the citizens of Dallas. Storing large qualities of chlorine can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do take providing the community with safe disinfected drinking water. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Dallas accidental release prevention policy involves proven technology and staff that has been well trained on operation and maintenance practices. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The Dallas WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine storage containers. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Dallas WTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site people.

Ellendale Rd. in the City of Dallas in Polk County. The plant, located on an acre of property, is about 1.2 miles west of the city limits of Dallas. Water is supplied to the plant via Rickreall Creek from Mercer Reservoir. Water from the plant services Dallas and Ellendale Water District. Treatment processes used at the plant include preliminary screening, flocculation and settling, sand bed filtration and chlorination. The Dallas WTP produces 8.5 million gallons per day (MGD).\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine in two, 1-ton steel storage tanks containing a maximum in each tank of 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The facility has the capacity to hold two more 1-ton containers, but seldom does so. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the RMP regulation. \nChlorine gas is injected from chlorine containers into a solution that is used in a variety of plant processes, primarily for final effluent disinfection. Gaseous chlorine, pulled from a storage container by an ejector, flows through chlorinators that control and measure the flow of gaseous chlorine. The gaseous chlorine is mixed with plant effluent water, and the solution is distributed to several locations in the plant. Chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage area and in the chlorination room. Other alarms include feed and evaporator malfunction and low bulk storage tank weight. These alarms are annunciated at the chlorine control panel, as well as, in the case of a leak an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.\n\nThe bulk storage tanks and the chlorinators are enclosed in separate rooms. Each rooms is equipped with a ventilation system. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided outside the storage room and on the same floor as the chlorinator room. Self-contained breathi"

Visitors and contractors must be approved by Dallas WTP staff prior to entry into the facility. The plant is manned during the day, year round, and alarms notify on-call staff during off-hours of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations. \n\nThe chlorination facilities are also provided with emergency generators. These generators will start within one second after a loss of power and will supply power to the leak detectors, lighting, and ventilation systems.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The worst-case scenario requires that that single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for off-site impacts from a chlorine tank rupture. The alternative release scenario for chlorine is a more likely release. \n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that the entire contents of the largest single container are released, regardless of how improbable that may be. In addition, only \"passive\" mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes (for liquids) can be considered. Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. The regulations require that the worst-case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas. According to EPA's rule, the toxic gas worst-case scenario must assume the release of the single largest vessel or container over a period of 10 minutes. For worst-case scenarios, releases are assumed to take place without consideration for physical cause or likelihood of occurrence.\n\nAt the WTP, chlorine containers are stored in a building immediately after arrival. Since the time the containers are outside the storage room is very short, the worst-case scenario was modeled using a release in an enclosed space, in dire"

The release rate reduction from the enclosed building is approximately 55 percent of the release rate from the bulk tank, per guidance from EPA regarding control efficiencies levels for buildings storing chlorine. The release rate will, accordingly, be 110 pounds per minute (lbs./min). \n\nThe bulk tank rupture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake. The released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud. The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA model RMP*Comp version 1.06. The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency respond planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. In practice this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The toxic endpoint selected by EPA was 3 ppm. In addition, all required EPA-model input parameters were included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions - Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, air temperature (77 degree F), and average humidity (50 percent). The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst-case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more of a possible release scenario that could occur compared to the worst-case release scenario. Unlike the worst-case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts. Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input. The alternative scenario used was a release of gaseous chlorine through the container valve. The tanks, evaporators, and associated piping are all in a building"

      "SummaryText": "; and the building mitigation was considered. Chlorine is piped as a gas from the one-ton containers to the chlorinating system. The alternative case scenario assumes that chlorine gas is released through a container valve with a diameter of 5/16 inch. This scenario assumes the release occurs for 60 minutes, an estimated time for plant operators to respond to the event. The RMP*Comp model calculated a chlorine release rate of 14.6 pounds per minute.\n\nThe same modeling approach was used as for the worst case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more likely conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 77 degrees F, and average humidity of 50 percent. The distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint (3 ppm) was determined to be 0.1 miles. The area within the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.03 square miles. Using EPA's Landview III block group uniform density method, the estimated population within the chlorine endpoint circle is 3 people.\n\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have cause safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Dallas WTP during the last five years. Some minor, incidental releases may have occurred over this period, but they were quickly handled by staff, were neutralized, or posed no safety or health hazards.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\nDallas WTP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Chemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, should a leak occur when changing chlorine supply tanks, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\n\nDallas WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Comprehensive safety proces"

In practice this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The toxic endpoint selected by EPA was 3 ppm. In addition, all required EPA-model input parameters were included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions - Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, air temperature (77 degree F), and average humidity (50 percent). The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst-case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more of a possible release scenario that could occur compared to the worst-case release scenario. Unlike the worst-case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts. Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input. The alternative scenario used was a release of gaseous chlorine through the container valve. The tanks, evaporators, and associated piping are all in a building; and the building mitigation was considered. Chlorine is piped as a gas from the one-ton containers to the chlorinating system. The alternative case"

      "SummaryText": " scenario assumes that chlorine gas is released through a container valve with a diameter of 5/16 inch. This scenario assumes the release occurs for 60 minutes, an estimated time for plant operators to respond to the event. The RMP*Comp model calculated a chlorine release rate of 14.6 pounds per minute.\n\nThe same modeling approach was used as for the worst case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more likely conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 77 degrees F, and average humidity of 50 percent. The distance to the chlorine toxic endpoint (3 ppm) was determined to be 0.1 miles. The area within the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.03 square miles. Using EPA's Landview III block group uniform density method, the estimated population within the chlorine endpoint circle is 3 people.\n\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have cause safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Dallas WTP during the last five years. Some minor, incidental releases may have occurred over this period, but they were quickly handled by staff, were neutralized, or posed no safety or health hazards.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\nDallas WTP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. Chemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus, should a leak occur when changing chlorine supply tanks, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\n\nDallas WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors\n* Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n* Use of inher"
