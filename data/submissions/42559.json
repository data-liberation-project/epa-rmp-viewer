Isophthalonitrile (IPN), Chlorothalonil (CTL), and chlorine distribution.\n\nThe CTL unit produces a fungicide, trade name Daconil? and Bravo? which is a fungicide for bananas, potatoes, peanuts, turf and other crop areas.  Chlorine is received in 180,000 pound rail cars, and is unloaded and distributed as a raw material in this process.  Chlorine is reacted with IPN to form chlorothalonil in a vapor phase reaction in the presence of catalyst.\n\nThe IPN for the CTL process is produced at GB Biosciences in the IPN unit.  Ammonia is used as a raw material in the IPN unit.  Metaxylene and ammonia are reacted together with catalyst to make IPN.  Ammonia enters the plant by rail car or tank truck, and is stored in a 12,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nThe plant has a chlorine distribution process which provides liquid chlorine to the CTL unit.  Chlorine comes into the plant in rail cars and is then transferred to the CTL unit via pipeline.  The liquid chlorine is vaporized in the CTL unit and is then fed into the process.\n\nSection 6 ? Accident History\n\nOver the past 5 years, the facility has experienced two accidental releases that met the RMP reporting criteria.  One incident occurred on May 19, 2000 and involved the release of 20 pounds of chlorine from the CTL process.  The incident resulted in one on-site injury and no off-site impacts.  The other incident occurred on February 12, 2003 and involved the release of 371 pounds of chlorine from the West Cooling Tower.  This incident resulted in an on-site shelter-in-place and the evacuation of 20 people from a nearby off-site facility.\n\nSection 7 ? Prevention Program Level 3\n\nGB Biosciences has two (2) regulated chemicals above the threshold quantity-ammonia and chlorine.  GB Biosciences has identified three covered processes ? IPN process, CTL process, and chlorine distribution.  The processes co"

Each process unit conducted a global process hazard analysis using the HAZOP methodology.  Projects and changes are handled with management of change (MOC) procedures.  As required, these changes undergo an appropriate PHA (Whatif/Checklist, Checklist, FMEA, Fault tree, etc.).  The PHAs presented in the RMP Plan are the comprehensive unit HAZOPs.  On a five year interval, the unit HAZOPs are re-validated and updated according to PHA findings.\n\nThe equipment for each area has been screened to determine if it can result in a catastrophic release to the environment.  This equipment has been classified as PSM covered.  This equipment is inspected on a frequency determined internally, based on past performance.  Any problems found during the inspections are repaired in a timely manner.\n\nThere are both operating and maintenance procedures for each unit.  These procedures are reviewed and certified on an annual basis.  GB Biosciences has developed computer based training (CBT) for each procedure.  Individuals affected by a procedure must perform a CBT for that procedure and pass a subsequent written test once per year.  Training records are kept of this activity.\n\nAll incidents are investigated to determine cause and to prevent recurrence.\n\nChanges to Improve Safety:\n\nDuring 1997 the Ammonia Storage Tank capacity was significantly reduced.  The storage capacity went from 60,000 gallons to 12,000 gallons.\n\nFormation of release reduction teams in the IPN and CTL areas.\n\nRecent Venture II project reduced the amount of chlorine in the CTL unit.\n\nThe two chlorine vaporizers previously in the chlorine distribution area were shutdown and replaced with one significantly smaller chlorine vaporizer installed in the CTL unit.\n\nSection 8 ? Prevention Program Level 2\n\nNo program level 2 processes.\n\nSection 9 ? Emergency Response\n\nThe Greens Bayou site has a 24 hour emergency response system in p"
