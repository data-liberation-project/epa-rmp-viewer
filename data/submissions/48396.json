Plant 75175 facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Response Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n1.)    To save lives.\n2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)    To protect the environment.\n4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\nAmeriCold Logistics maintains an emergency response (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which were implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 75175 facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid"

Hg) on the low-pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is above the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nDiscussion removed per regulation\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nDiscussion removed per regulation\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\nIIAR Bulletin 107, ?Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins?\nIIAR Bulletin 109, ?Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System?\nIIAR, ?A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System?\n\nIn addition, the AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 75175 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation since May 2002\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents at this facility from the five years.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe AmeriCold Logistics, Inc. Plant 75175 has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nDuring the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures. In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nDuring review of the Process Safety Manageme"

Plant 75175 facility located at 720 Butler Drive, Murfreesboro, TN 37129.  These action items were entered into a management system and addressed.\n\nIn addition to the equipment related mitigation measures recommended to improve safety at this facility, the RMP Development Team made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety.  These recommendations are a result of the review of the PSM prevention programs and the Emergency Response Program for preparation of the Risk Management Program and Plan. These action items were entered into a management system and addressed."
