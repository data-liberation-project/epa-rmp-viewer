A safe workplace is a top priority for company management and personnel, and Mississippi Chemical employees continuously look for innovative ways to operate and maintain the production facilities in a safe manner.  Mississippi Chemical participates in routine safety training programs and drills.  In addition, continuous monitoring and assessment of the plant facilities ensure that all operations are running smoothly and efficiently.\n\nMississippi Chemical has a close working relationship with local emergency responders, and together we are prepared to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility.  To ensure proper emergency preparedness, Mississippi Chemical has several teams of employees trained in confined space rescue, hazardous waste operations and other specialties.\n\nMCC's worst -case release scenario, as required through RMP, is the failure of a 30,000-ton ammonia storage tank.  The selection of the ammonia storage tank for the worst-case release is strictly taken from the regulatory definition of the worst-case release; the entire 30,000 tons of ammonia is released in 10 minutes.  This produces a scenario with a 6.2-mile distance to the endpoint of impact to the community.  This was determined by the use of a computer air modeling program called DEGADIS.\n\nMCC's alternative scenarios include the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine and 80 tons of ammonia. The selection of the alternative scenar"

      "SummaryText": "ios was based on researching information sources for release data.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) database and publications from the AIChE Ammonia Safety Symposia were reviewed.  Informal interviews with ammonia and urea plant operators, supervisors, engineers and managers were conducted in each plant.\n\nMCC uses chlorine in 2,000-pound cylinders for water treatment.  The complete failure of one of these cylinders under the regulatory-defined parameters produces a scenario with a 0.49 mile distance to the endpoint of the community.  MCC receives and ships ammonia in railcars. By regulation, the railcar can not hold more than 80 tons of ammonia.  A complete failure of an 80-ton railcar under the regulatory-defined parameters produces a scenario with a 0.90-mile distance to the endpoint.  The distances to the endpoint for the alternate scenarios were also determined by the use of a computer air modeling program called DEGADIS.\n\nMCC's safety and environmental record reflects the company's commitment.  We have multiple layers of safety and environmental protection integrated into our daily operations at our plants to protect our employees and the community.  The following identifies some primary layers of protection:\n \n7 Managing risks is something we do on a daily basis.\n \n7 We have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n \n7 Our employees are highly skilled and well-trained.\n\n7 Our equipment is routinely inspected and tested to make sure it is safe.\n \n7 We have computer monitors and controls in the process throughout our plants to detect potential leaks or releases before they occur.\n \n7 Hazard reviews add another layer of protection.  They involve \"what if\" scenarios where employee teams investigate every possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n \n7 Hazard reviews are also conducted on all existing MCC facilities."

The following summarizes the elements of the release prevention program that are in operation at our Yazoo City facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWorkplace health and safety are of paramount concern.  MCC maintains a file and makes its employees aware of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  This information is maintained in the workplace.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nMCC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is known as the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, MCC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nMCC has a comprehensive training program to inform and educate employees and to ensure they are competent in the operating pro"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nMCC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment during each operational turn around to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nProposed changes are evaluated for potential impact in the areas of safety, regulatory, etc., before being implemented.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews of new processes and to significant modifications in existing processes are conducted as a regular practice at MCC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nMCC conducts audits on a regular basis to monitor and sustain this process and ensure that MCC management is kept informed of all safety, health, and environmental matters.  Formal audits will be completed at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nMCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
