The chilled water is used to remove heat from the dispersion manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nThe NJDEP and the USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as a worse-case release scenario.  Companies are also required to analyze an alternative release scenario.  \r\nThe worse-case scenario is a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of any toxic material or flammable listed under the regulations as determined by USEPA.  The USEPA mandates that companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance in ten (10) minutes.  Mexichem Specialty Resin could not consider the numerous prevention and emergency response systems, procedures, equipment, controls, and trained employees that are in place as part of this scenario.\r\nThe alternative case scenario is a more credible scenario that is closer to a real world incident.  Facilities are allowed to include active safety systems.  Active safety systems include procedures and equipment which are used to contain or minimize the impact of an accidental release.  Examples of active safety systems are detection systems, computer controlled valves, fire protection systems and employee actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nMexichem Specialty Resin has one regulated flammable substance: Vinyl Chloride (VCM) CAS No. 75-01-4\r\nThe worse-case scenario assumes the failure of the largest storage tank.  This tank has a capacity of 5,000 gallons; however, written operating procedures and high level alarms prevent more than 4,000 gallons from being present at one time.  Failure of this tank would release 4,000 gallons (31,000 pounds) of Vinyl Chloride.  It is assumed tha"

The distance from the source to its endpoint is 0.22 miles.  For flammables, the endpoint is the level at which a fire or explosion could damage dwelllings or hurt people.  Distance to the endpoint for Vinyl  Chloride was found in Table 9 in the USEPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. \r\nMexichem Specialty Resin has one regulated toxic substance: Ammonia (anhydrous) CAS No. 7664-41-7\r\nThe worst case scenario assumes failure of the largest single heat exchanger.  This heat exchanger has a capacity of 1,850 gallons; however, written operating procedures and high level alarms prevent more than 650 gallons from being present at one time. Failure of this heat exchanger would release 650 gallons (3,500 pounds) of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released within ten minutes.  The distance from the source to its endpoint is 1.2 miles.  For toxic materials, the endpoint is the chemical concentration in the air to which a person can be exposed for up to one hour without serious health effects.  Distance to the endpoint for Ammonia (anhydrous) was found in USEPA's Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Exhibit 4-4 and Figure 4-2.  \r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nFlammable Substance: Vinyl Chloride (VCM) CAS No. 75-01-4\r\nThe alternative release scenario is a gasket leak at a pipe or valve flange connection equivalent to a 1/4 hole.  The leak is isolated within ten minutes.  A leak rate of 80 pounds per minute would result in a release of 800 pounds over ten minutes.  Unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit (LFL). The distance to the endpoint for the LFL is less than 0.06 miles.  Distance to lower flammability limit (LFL) for Vinyl  Chloride was found in Table 20 in the USEPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. \r\nToxic Substance: Ammonia (anhydrous) CAS No. 7664-41-7\r\nThe alternative release scenario is a gasket le"

First and foremost is Mexichem Specialty Resin Policy and commitment to excellence in the areas of Safety, Health and Environmental Compliance.  Mexichem Specialty Resin has built a strong reputation fulfilling this commitment at the Federal, State and local level and with its own employees and contractors.  Second are the fourteen key elements of Mexichem Specialty Resin program.  Adherence to these elements is further demonstration of PolyOne's commitment to excellence.  Third are the specific mitigation measurements associated with regulated materials that  Mexichem Specialty Resin has in place.  These include dikes, curbs, impervious containment, detection systems, automatic controls, isolation valves, on site wastewater treatment and back-up systems.  Fourth is the site comprehensive emergency response program discussed below.  Finally, it is Mexichem Specialty Resin's commitment for continued improvement in all covered process areas.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nMexichem Specialty Resin has in place an approved Risk Management Program for Ammonia encompassing prevention elements consistent with the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) Title 13, 1B-3.  Mexichem Specialty Resinalso has an approved plan under the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (DPCC) (N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11) for both Ammonia and Vinyl Chloride.  Additionally, Mexichem Specialty Resinhas a structured program under the Occupational Safety and He"
