The Pedricktown facility manufactures speciality dispersion resins. Dispersion resins are used in a wide array of products including resilient vinyl flooring, vinyl gloves, toys, weather stripping, spray coating, can coatings, carpet backing, adhesives and adhesive bandage strips. \n\nDuring the past few  years, Mexichem Specialty Resin has proactively been discussing the most recent Risk Management Program regulatory requirements with community and county officials.  This activity included educational sessions and tours with emergency response personnel, discussion of regulated materials and the prevention programs in place to prevent releases, emergency response capabilities and methods and considerations used to calculate worse-case and alternative release scenarios.   \n\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nMexichem Specialty Resin has a strong commitment to accidental release prevention and emergency response as stated in the Plant Manager's Safety and Health Message, Company Environmental Policy and Company Safety and Health Policy.  Mexichem Specialty Resin has fulfilled this commitment through a long history of outstanding safety performance, including receipt of the New Jersey Governor's Award and numerous industry and company awards for safety and environmental excellence.

This conversion takes place in a closed computerized process using state of the art technology.  The product is then dried, packaged and shipped to customers.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to make chilled water.  The chilled water is used to remove heat from the dispersion manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe NJDEP and the USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as a worse-case release scenario.  Companies are also required to analyze an alternative release scenario.  \n\nThe worse-case scenario is a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of any toxic material or flammable listed under the regulations as determined by USEPA.  The USEPA mandates that companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance in ten (10) minutes.  Mexichem Specialty Resin could not consider the numerous prevention and emergency response systems, procedures, equipment, controls, and trained employees that are in place as part of this scenario.\n\nThe alternative case scenario is a more credible scenario that is closer to a real world incident.  Facilities are allowed to include active safety systems.  Active safety systems include procedures and equipment which are used to contain or minimize the impact of an accidental release.  Examples of active safety systems are detection systems, computer controlled valves, fire protection systems and employee actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nMexichem Specialty Resin has one regulated flammable substance: Vinyl Chloride (VCM) CAS No. 75-01-4\n\nThe worse-case scenario assumes the failure of the largest storage tank.  This tank has a capacity of 5,000 gallons; however, written operating procedures and high level alarms prevent more than 4,000 gallons from being present at one time.  Failure of this tank would release 4,000 gallons (31,000 pounds) of Vinyl Chloride.  It is assumed tha"

The distance from the source to its endpoint is 0.22 miles.  For flammables, the endpoint is the level at which a fire or explosion could damage dwelllings or hurt people.  Distance to the endpoint for Vinyl  Chloride was found in Table 9 in the USEPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. \n\nMexichem Specialty Resin has one regulated toxic substance: Ammonia (anhydrous) CAS No. 7664-41-7\n\nThe worst case scenario assumes failure of the largest single heat exchanger.  This heat exchanger has a capacity of 1,850 gallons; however, written operating procedures and high level alarms prevent more than 650 gallons from being present at one time. Failure of this heat exchanger would release 650 gallons (3,500 pounds) of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released within ten minutes.  The distance from the source to its endpoint is 1.2 miles.  For toxic materials, the endpoint is the chemical concentration in the air to which a person can be exposed for up to one hour without serious health effects.  Distance to the endpoint for Ammonia (anhydrous) was found in USEPA's Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Exhibit 4-4 and Figure 4-2.  \n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nFlammable Substance: Vinyl Chloride (VCM) CAS No. 75-01-4\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a gasket leak at a pipe or valve flange connection equivalent to a 1/4\" hole.
