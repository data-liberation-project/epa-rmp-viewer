Each compressor station receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transports the gas to a processing plant.  Control of the dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons).  The amount of moisture in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the well heads.  The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\n\nAs gas flows through the pipeline, its temperature will decrease to about the same temperature as the surrounding environment.  If this temperature is below the dew point of the gas, the water and heavy hydrocarbons will tend to condense.  The resulting buildup of hydrates can begin to restrict gas flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe.  In extreme cold, the hydrates may  form a potentially dangerous ice plug.\n\nIn order to reduce the dew point of the gas (minimize the formation of hydrates), the inlet gas is put through a slug catcher, an inlet separator, and a glycol contactor with scrubber to remove moisture.  Compression of the gas causes some of the naturally occurring hydrocarbons, which are in the vapor phase of the inlet gas stream, to condense out of the stream.  This allows heavy hydrocarbons and water to condense out of the gas resulting in a lower dew point.  These condensed raw natural gas liquids (NGL), also called condensate, are stored in tanks until there is a sufficient volume to be pumped into a tank truck for transportation for processing into marketable products.  The glycol is regenerated and used again.\n\nThe flammability and volume of the raw NGL stored at The Fort Lupton Compressor Station triggered coverage under the EPA RMP Standard.\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Fort Lupton Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the early 1970's.

KN Energy operated the system from April 1993 through December 1, 1999.\n\nProgram Level\n\nHS Gathering has determined that Program Level 3 applies to the Fort Lupton Compressor Station since it is under OSHA,s PSM Standard and less than 0.2 miles from the condensate tanks to NARCO's laboratory across the road.  The Fort Lupton Compressor Station has a documented Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated with the local Fire Department and has had no accidental release of the regulated substance (condensate) that directly or indirectly caused a death, injury, or response or restoration activity for an environmental receptor in the previous five years.\n\nOffsite consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with flammable substances stored at the Fort Lupton Compressor Station is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a catastrophic tank failure in the condensate tank storage area.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 80% of the maximum tank capacity.  Therefore the reduced inventory is assumed, resulting in a release of 31,000 lbs. (approximately 5700 gals.) of condensate over a 10-minute period.  Although we have various controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures (such as dikes or berms) was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion of this material was 0.2 miles.  No other Program Level 2 or 3 processes containing regulated substances were identified at the Fort Lupton Compressor Station.\n\nThe alternative release scenario was assumed to be a half filled tank failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  No credit for passive mitigation measures (such as dikes or berms) was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, HS Gathering personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, HS Gathering will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies.\n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\nHS Gathering's Fort Lupton Compressor Station is located in Weld County, Colorado about three (3) miles east of Highway 85 on WCR 22 in a rural area which is used primarily for farming.  NARCO's Gas Plant is across the road.\n\nThe Fort Lupton Compressor Station is made up of two systems: a high pressure and a low pressure system.  Units #31, #32, #34,and #35 are the high pressure units with discharge pressure not to exceed 1220 psig.  The high pressure throughput is 25 MMCF/D.  The high pressure discharge goes through glycol dehydration and is discharged to delivery points via 12 and 20 cleanable pipelines.\n\nThe low pressure system consists of units #33, #36, and #37.  Discharge pressure of the low pressure system shall not exceed 280 psig.  The low pressure throughput is 150 MMCF/D.  Gas is discharged to Hudson Compressor Station for recompression via 24 cleanable low pressure pipeline.  The station is equipped with inlet seperation.  Liquids separation goes to five 225 barrel product storage tanks. \n\nThe purpose of a compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipel"
