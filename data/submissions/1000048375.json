The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.\r\n\r\nD. Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nSouthcross maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures will be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management.

All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\r\n\r\nF. Contractors\r\n\r\nSouthcross uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near Covered Process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\r\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\r\n2.

Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nSouthcross has established practices and procedures for the safe operation of fixed, rotating and emergency shutdown equipment. The basic aspects of the program include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n1. Conducting training\r\n2. Developing written procedures\r\n3. Performing inspections and tests\r\n4. Correcting identified deficiencies\r\n5. Applying quality assurance measures\r\n\r\nIn combination, these activities form a system to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process. \r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on:\r\n1.

Management of Change\r\n\r\nSouthcross has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all Reported Covered Processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to:\r\n\r\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\r\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\r\n\r\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\r\n\r\nSouthcross promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nFrio LaSalle Pipeline LP (dba Southcross) owns a natural gas fractionation facility, the Robstown Fractionator in Nueces County, Texas. The facility is designed to process natural gas liquids by fractionation into end products that will be delivered to end markets. \r\n\r\nSouthcross has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Robstown Fractionator is located near Robstown, Texas.  Y Grade is received by the facility and is used to produce the following NGL products:\r\n1. Isobutane\r\n2. Butane\r\n3. Propane\r\n4. Natural Gas (C5+)\r\n\r\nThe received Y Grade and produced products can contain the following components:\r\na. Methane\r\nb. Ethane\r\nc. Propane\r\nd. Butane\r\ne. Isobutane\r\nf. Pentane\r\ng. Isopentane\r\nh. carbons larger than C5+\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nA. Employee Participation\r\nSouthcross encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\r\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\r\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\r\n4. Participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\r\nEmployees have Southcross to all information pertaining to the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nB. Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nSouthcross keeps a variety of technical documents that are"

      "SummaryText": "Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed. Final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nM. Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of existing features applicable to prevention of accidental release of regulated substances in this facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\nSouthcross's accident release prevention and response policies are applied to all RMP-covered processes. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nN. Specialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nSite specific detection and control equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the plant to:\r\n1. Contain/control a release\r\n2. Quickly detect a release, and\r\n3. Reduce the consequences of an RMP-regulated substance release\r\nThe following type of safety features are used in the covered process: Release Containment/Control\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n3. Automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and automatically operate all automatic valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare.\r\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquids releases\r\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation\r\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n1. Fire extinguishers only\r\n2. Trained emergency response personnel\r\n3. Personal protective equipment\r\n\r\nO. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Robstown Fractionator is newly built and has had no RMP-regulated substance release during the past five years. \r\n\r\nP. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nSouthcross's Robstown Fractionator is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency act"
