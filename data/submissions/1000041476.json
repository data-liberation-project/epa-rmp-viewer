This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \r\n\r\nThe Black Canyon Facility, located about 17 miles northwest of LaBarge, Wyoming, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes one primary operation (dehydration) to prepare the natural gas/liquid mixture for transportation to the ExxonMobil Production Company Shute Creek Facility for processing.  This facility could contain a regulated flammable mixture and a regulated toxic substance.  Transportation of natural gas regulated substances into and out of the facility is handled via pipeline.  Regulated flammable liquids are trucked out of the facility.  This facility is surrounded by rolling hills and mountains.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \r\n\r\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the USEPA, data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.  Refer to Data Element Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this plan.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention"

These include orientations for visitors/contractors; control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; energy isolation for equipment being worked on; procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment; hot work permit/procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities; vehicle entry into process area; confined space entry permit/procedure to help ensure precautions are taken before entering confined spaces; safety and security device bypass expectations; simultaneous operations guidance; and job safety analyses (JSAs) to identify and mitigate hazards associated with maintenance tasks.  These practices, along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThis facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes.  The MOC facilitates appropriate review and authorization before a change is implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated for these changes.

Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.

The Management of Change (MOC) is used to steward assignment and completion of PSSRs.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\r\n\r\nExxonMobil's Facility Integrity Management System (FIMS) is designed to manage mechanical integrity.  By incorporation of FIMS into its processes, this facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief/vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this MI program include: training, written procedures, inspections/tests, correction of identified deficiencies, and quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Maintenance personnel receive training on the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures and equipment manuals help ensure work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  \r\n\r\nInspections/tests and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to help ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness, etc.).  If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service or a group of experts (e.g., engineers, etc.) review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the equipment until the deficiency can be corrected.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the MI program is quality assurance.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that reports can be reviewed during the next PHA revalidation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, an audit is conducted at the facility at least once every 3 years to determine whether the program's procedures and practices are being implemented.  An audit team consisting of both facility and technical personnel evaluate the implementation/effectiveness of the processes in this accident prevention program and develop findings that are documented and forwarded to management to coordinate resolution.  Corrective actions are taken in response to the audit team's findings, and resolution status is tracked until actions are completed.

Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  The Competency Assurance Standard (CAS) provides guidance and electronic tools to ensure the procedures are maintained.

This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce for routine maintenance or construction.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are in place to help ensure contractors: perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in the workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow safety rules, and inform facility personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to working in this facility which includes: a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, applicable emergency action plan provisions, and information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis (JSA) is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to maintenance/construction tasks.\r\n\r\nFacility personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.
