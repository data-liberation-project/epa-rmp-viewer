Approach To Regulatory Compliance\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 and the California Process Safety Management Program, CCR Title 8, Section 5189 as enforced by the local Certified Unified Program Agency and the Fed/EPA.  \n\nThis program is intended to be a ?living document.?  As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible. To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way which is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.  Therefore, for the purposes of auditing and regulatory review the following table is provided to provide concordant information regarding the program and the required regulatory elements. \n\n1. THE  SIMONIAN FRUIT CO., RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Simonian Fruit Co. has prepared a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.

At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA?s ?Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials? standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, ?Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials,? and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which can be contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Simonian Fruit Co. business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Simonian Fruit Co. facility is a commercial packinghouse for deciduous tree fruit ? apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums, grapes, persimmons and kiwi fruit.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  Two rooms are designated as ?precooling? rooms, whi"

There is a cooled loading dock area as well.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a series of a liquid feed solenoid valves.  From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the outside walls of the rooms.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to one of two primary accumulator vessels located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to reciprocating compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.  There are three high pressure receivers; two vertical tanks in the engine room and one horizontal tank in a shed alongside the building, however, they are piped together so that they act in concert.   \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 ?Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems?.  It was also built in compliance with"

      "SummaryText": " the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency ?dump box? contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels, which are not directly connected.  Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\n\n3. AMMONIA RELEASE SCENARIOS\nIn light of recent changes in the CalARP RMP and OSHA PSM requirements, this section has been deleted.\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Simonian Fruit Co. facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The system can contain a total charge of up to approximately 14,500 lbs though the current inventory is approximately 9,600 lbs. It is extremely important that the system is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked weekly by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of a"

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR ?Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.?  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSimonian Fruit Co. has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n6. EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, ?Emergency Action Plans.?  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, ?Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,? and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond ?minimally? to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done by the local fire department and the Fresno County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Simonian Fruit Co. continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.

      "SummaryText": "ementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Simonian Fruit Co. business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n \nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format, which is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Simonian Fruit Co. now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a ?living document?.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Simonian Fruit Co. employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Simonian Fruit Co. will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
