Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Foamex international Inc. facility in Compton, California stores and processes toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the USEPA.\r\n\r\nThe same properties that make TDI valuable for use at the Foamex facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance. Safety policies and procedures have been implemented that prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of employees, as well as to minimize the threat to nearby members of the community. It is the policy of Foamex International Inc. to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\r\n\r\nFoamex International Inc. is committed to the safety of its employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Successful implementation of the facility's accidental release prevention program will ensure that emergencies are minimized and reduce the probability that emergency response procedures will be implemented. Regardless of the preventative measures that are implemented, an emergency such as a release of TDI remains a possible, if improbable, event. Foamex has emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, employees, contractors, or other personnel, and without undue risk of environmental degradation. \r\n\r\n2. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the Foamex facility in Compton is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce bedding, furniture, packaging, and a number of other products. \r\n\r\nTDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the facility by railcar and tank truck and transferred to a 3"

      "SummaryText": "0,000-gallon outdoor storage tank. The maximum quantity of TDI stored in railcars and storage tanks at the facility at any given time is approximately 500,000 pounds. The TDI is pumped through piping from the storage tank to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam. The foam is then conveyed to cutting stations where it is cut to the size and shape specified by the customer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis of Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAn Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment. The OCA consists of evaluating the Worst-Case Release Scenario (WCRS) and an Alternative-Case Release Scenario (ACRS). A Worst-Case Release Scenario is not expected to ever occur. An Alternative-Case Release Scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility such as the Foamex facility. Alternative-Case Release Scenarios aid the facility in working with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release. This distance is referred to as the endpoint distance. At the endpoint distance, most people would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g. strong eye or throat irritation) are likely. Some people who are particularly sensitive to the released substance could be incapacitated.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophic failure of a railcar having a capacity of 190,000 pounds of TDI, would be the Worst-Case Release Scenario for a toxic substance since a railcar of TDI is the largest outdoor TDI container that is not in a diked area at the Foamex facility. The TDI producers limit the quantity of TDI loaded into a railcar to a maximum of 190,000 pounds to all"

      "SummaryText": "ow space for thermal expansion due to possible heating of the TDI while in the railcar. During cold weather, the TDI railcar is pre-heated to a maximum temperature of 67 degrees Fahrenheit to facilitate unloading and prevent TDI solidification. During hot weather, the TDI could reach the maximum ambient temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Since a release at a higher temperature would result in a greater endpoint distance, the release has been assumed to occur at the maximum temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit. It was also assumed that the entire contents of the railcar would be released as a liquid and form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately 76,000 square feet with a depth of 0.4 inches (1 centimeter). This pool would then evaporate to form a vapor cloud that would disperse downwind. Dispersion modeling predicts a distance of 0.3 miles from the railcar to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm (0.007 mg/L).\r\n\r\nRupture of a transfer hose connecting the railcar to the TDI storage tank was assumed to be the Alternative-Case Release Scenario. A rupture such as this would release TDI to the ground at a rate of 6,076 pounds per minute. It was assumed that the release would continue for a period of ten minutes before an employee could stop the flow of compressed air that powers the transfer operation. The resulting pool would spread to cover an area of approximately 24,300 square feet with a depth of 0.4 inches and evaporate to form a vapor cloud that would disperse downwind. Dispersion modeling predicts a distance of 0.2 miles from the pool to the TDI toxic endpoint of 0.98 ppm.\r\n\r\n4.

The following types of safety features are used in various sections of the TDI process:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* Process alarms (pressure, flow)\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Curbing or diked areas to contain liquid TDI releases\r\n\r\n* Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters (high level, high pressure)\r\n\r\n* Pressure/vacuum relief valves on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\r\n\r\n* Magnetic drive TDI transfer pumps without seals to minimize leaks\r\n\r\n* Isolation valves on process equipment\r\n\r\n* Double lined TDI railcars\r\n\r\n* Top unloading procedures for TDI railcars\r\n\r\n* Isolation valves at plant stormwater discharge point near TDI process\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n\r\n* Trained emergency response personnel\r\n\r\n* Readily accessible personal protective equipment (e.g protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, breathing air stations)\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no releases of TDI in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage. One small release of TDI has occurred during the past five years. The release occurred outside, inside of a fully contained area, and was too small to result in injuries or significant damage.\r\n\r\n6. The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Foamex facility emergency response program is based upon the requirements of OSHA's emergency action and fire prevention plan regulation, OSHA's hazardous waste and emergency operations regulations, and the USEPA's emergency response program requirements in the RMP rule. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of TDI. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup a"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated as necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Personnel affected by changes are informed and/or trained on these changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the facility is coordinated with the LEPC. This coordination includes participation in periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and other industry representatives. The facility has twenty-four hour communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the Fire Department. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The facility also conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nFoamex strives to continuously improve upon the safety of the TDI process through periodic safety reviews and a program of soliciting safety suggestions from employees. The hazard review and incident investigation programs are specially designed to identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the process. The following changes are currently planned for implementation:\r\n\r\n* Upgrade inspections and tests of selected equipment/instrumentation designed to prevent TDI releases.\r\n\r\n* Consider further examination of process safety shutdown interlocks for possible implementation.\r\n\r\n* Investigate the feasibility of installing secondary containment in the railcar storage and unloading area.\r\n\r\n* Perform modifications to the TDI tank and pipe racks as recommended in the s"
