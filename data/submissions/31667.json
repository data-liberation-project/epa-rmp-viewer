      "SummaryText": "The City of Midwest City operates a water treatment plant in the southeast area of Midwest City Oklahoma.  The plant uses chlorine to disinfect potable water used by its citizens.  Safety for the plant personel and our neighbors is the foremost concern of all city employees.  Our policy is to minimize to the utmost any possible hazard associated with the use of chlorine to personnel, the environment, and community neighbors.  We have specific safety training and procedures implemented to assure safe use of this chemical.  This safety training is backed up with preventive maintanence, safe handling,  and various safety features which take place during use so that each individual knows what is expected or what he is to contribute in handling this product.  The maximum in inventory of ton cylinders is six with only two cylinders in use at a time.  All full cylinders are stored inside of a secured area where no one can see them, which was not reported in the initial write up.  Maximum release of chlorine in case of a broken valve or ruptured line would not exceed 4000 pounds at any one time and would affect 5,200 residents living close to the plant location.  The second site, a booster station, has 2000 pounds of chlorine store in a secured area, out of sight and locked.  These containers are 150 pound cylinders  and if spillage did occur the population affected would be 2500 residents.  There is a school  located in the approximate zone of contamination which is constantly on our minds.  If at any time an error would occur  the Midwest City HAZMAT team, a division of the fire department, would be the first notified for response. Our plan contains procedures for notifying the proper authorities, and those in the immediate vicinity who would need to be evacuated immediately from the area."
