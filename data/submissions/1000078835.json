The same properties that make this material valuable as a blowing agent in our manufacturing process also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling. These precautions are in place to prevent the unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the health of our employees, and to reduce the threat to members of the nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle isobutane. This combined with the safety devices inherent in the design, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our employees helps insure the safety of our employees and of the surrounding community. Our emergency response program is meant to comply with the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Law (Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act). FP International's response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \r\n\r\n2) Stationary source and regulated substance handled\r\n\r\nA) At our Hopkinsville facility, FP International uses polyethylene in manufacturing our products. In the processes to make foamed polyethylene, isobutane blowing agent is injected into the polymer melt during the extrusion processes. One 14,193 gallon storage tank is used to store isobutane.\r\n\r\nB) The regulated substance handled at this facility is isobutane.\r\n\r\nC) The maximum amount of this material stored at this facility is 75,000 pounds. \r\n\r\n3) General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThis manufacturing facility complies with the EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and with all applicable State Codes and Regulations. This facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58 and NFPA -30.  As part"

      "SummaryText": "of our Corporate Injury Illness and Prevention Plan all employees receive training covering the following aspects of health and safety; safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures and hazardous communications. In addition to the training received upon employment, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if any employee is reassigned to a job which exposes them to new hazards. Our Corporate Hazard Communication Plan, which is located in our safety manual, contains safe work practices, descriptions of the use and care of personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures in case of spills or releases. Emergency and first-aid procedures are also covered.    \r\n\r\n4) Five year accident history  \r\n\r\nThere have been no releases at this facility during this period.\r\n\r\n5) The emergency response program\r\n\r\nThis facility's Emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Handbook. \r\n\r\n6) Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nMonthly safety inspections are conducted at this facility and safety deficiencies are corrected as they occur. No major upgrades to this facility are planned at this time.\r\n\r\n7) The Polystyrene Foam Process using Isopentane has been sold and removed from the property along with the remaining Isopentane gas.
