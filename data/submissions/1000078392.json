The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Super Store Industries facility chills and stores a variety of food products in the cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  The process is similar to a household refrigerator in that it is a closed system with no expected emissions or leaks.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is 26,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n-IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n\n-IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n-IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n\n\nIn addition, Super Store Industries has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910."

This program is constantly being improved to more accurately describe the prevention programs in use at the facility.\n\n\n\nBuilding Codes:\n\n\n\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies having jurisdiction.  Special attention is directed to but not limited to:\n\n\n\n-ANSI/ASHRAE 15-1989 - Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n\n-ANSI/IIAR 2-1984 - Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems\n\n-ANSI BB31.5-1983 - Refrigeration Piping\n\n-ASME - Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX\n\n-UMC - Uniform Mechanical Code\n\n-UFC - Uniform Fire Code\n\n-NFPA - Fire Protection\n\n-UBC - Uniform Building Code, 1991, Seismic Zone 3\n\n\n\nEngineering Measures:\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system uses a computer system to bring equipment on-line, off-line, control the hot gas (compressor discharge) defrosting process, manipulate solenoid valves, and monitor the system for alarms.  Ammonia sensors are used throughout the facility and are connected to the computer system.  The high pressure receiver has a solenoid actuated king valve that is closed when any of the emergency shutdown buttons are activated.\n\n\n\nThere is one emergency shut off button at the Super Store Industries facility located outside the engine room.  In the event that the switch is activated, all refrigeration system equipment will be shutdown.  This includes the compressors, ammonia pumps, defrost hot gas regulators, and King Solenoid Valve.  The programmable controller will however, continue to read all the system sensors.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nA review into the facility's accident history revealed that there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (February 2014 to February 2019) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries result"

All refrigeration operators are trained to Technician Level and all warehouse supervisors are Cal-OSHA First Responder at the Operations Level trained (8 hours).  The Super Store Industries' \"Emergency Action and Response Plan\", is designed to meet the requirements for \"Process Safety Management\", and give our employees and community the maximum protection in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nThe contents of this plan is part of the Hazardous Materials Business Plan which is uploaded to the California Environmental Reporting System for review by the San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department. The process for developing the best possible mitigation to any release large or small is through employee participation using the \"Process Safety Management Committee\", and any site specific documented plan previously used. \n\n\n\nAnnual training for all \"First Responders\" includes continuously changing scenarios that are discussed to always improve Action Safety. \n\n\n\nSuper Store Industries also conducts annual evacuation drills to provide training and to evaluate employee response in the event of a potential release.  \n\n \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation conducted on February 14, 2019, and the Three-Year Compliance Audit conducted on January 29, 2018, provided mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Super Store Industries facility located at 16888 McKinley Avenue in Lathrop, California 95330.  In addition to the recommendations, the facility plans to have refrigeration operators review training videos provided by the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) and other associations in an overall effort to maintain awareness with respect to the hazards associated with operating an ammonia refrigeration system"
