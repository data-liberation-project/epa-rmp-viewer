Other commercial neighbors are located on the same site.\r\n\r\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Refrigeration Trailers (Compression Units), Evaporative Condensers, Pressure Vessels, HydroVac&trade; Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  The vacuum tubes are used to pre-cool agricultural product; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for pressure cooling and short-term product storage.  Evaporators in the storage section of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with isolation and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas.  Some of the equipment is portable and is used in different areas during the off-season.  DCC~CDS owns the fixed facility, stationary ammonia-handling equipment and sev"

The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The DCC~CDS PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of DCC~CDS to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  \r\n\r\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. The Company has adopted a Non-responding facility policy and has established an Emergency Action Plan within its California Hazardous Material Business Plan. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (Monter"

The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and process, and to prevent accidental releases.  DCC~CDS strives to make the PSM Program an integral part of daily Plant operation.  Other safety programs are integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable and appropriate.\r\n\r\nDCC~CDS has delegated maintenance of its ammonia refrigeration equipment to WPS.  WPS is a reputable state-wide provider of ammonia refrigeration equipment and services, and has developed comprehensive written procedures for the maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  Written procedures include necessary safety precautions, from installation and start-up to tear-down and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment inspection or maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the Service Call system. Tasks are then tracked through the system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, DCC~CDS and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced release potential.\r\n\r\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).
