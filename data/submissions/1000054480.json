              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees, working at the bulk storage plant, make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, oral testing, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of a new hire.  The company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.\n\n\n\n",

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the local fire department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the fire department notification, the appropriate LEPC/EMA will be contacted.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or Acts of God which might occur on our premises.  The primary emergency coordinator for the facility is the location manager. \n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE FACILITY\n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.  The anhydrous ammonia, stored at this facility, is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. The system consists of storage vessel(s) with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment.
