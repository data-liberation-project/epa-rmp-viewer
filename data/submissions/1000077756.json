These are flammable gases, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and reduce health threats to our workers and the nearby community.  Aeropres Corporation will strictly adhere to all federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nSafety depends on:\n\n\n\na)    The manner in which we handle these products\n\nb)    The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility\n\nc)    Operating and maintenance procedures\n\nd)    Employee training\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program details employee responsibilities, actions, and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and the LEPC to notify potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to:\n\n\n\na)    Receive and store liquefied petroleum gases, difluroethane, and dimethyl ether\n\nb)    Remove trace contaminants\n\nc)    Blend these products to customer specification\n\nd)    Ship the finished products to our customers via truck and rail\n\n\n\nOur customers use this product as propellant in aerosols.  \n\n\n\nAccess to the facility is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAeropres complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

A thorough accident investigation was conducted in accordance with the site's Incident Investigation procedure that included a written report and recommendations to prevent reoccurrence.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response program, in accordance with the PSM rules.   The emergency response program includes appropriate mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response.  A copy of the emergency response program has been sent to the Grundy County LEPC.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
