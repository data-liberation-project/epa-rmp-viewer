We deliver liquid hydrogen, primarily from our McIntosh, AL plant, into two cryogenic storage vessels.  The liquid hydrogen is then vaporized (converted to gas)and the hydrogen gas is then transferred via pipeline to three nearby customers.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\nLiquid Hydrogen is stored on site. The liquid hydrogen is vaporized into gas and supplied to customers via pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible CareA&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Theodore, AL Hydrogen Station has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associat"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n\n\nThe liquid hydrogen storage tanks are equipped with a remote isolation switch that can remotely isolate the tanks in the event of a spill or release.  The tanks are also equipped with a dual relief system which includes bursting disc and pressure relief valves that discharge to a properly designed relief valve vent system.  The hydrogen gas pipeline is protected by a low pressure pipeline alarm and a hydrogen line low temperature protection device.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Theodore Hydrogen Station facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Theodore Hydrogen Station location will be a \"non-responding facility\" as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management P"

We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\n\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
