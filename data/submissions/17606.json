The Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) was written to implement Section 12(r) of these amendments.  The rule, which build upon existing industry codes and standards, requires companies of all sizes that use certain flammable and toxic substances to develop a Risk Management Program which includes:\n\n* Hazard assessment that details the potential effects of an accidental release, and accident history of the last five years, and an evaluation of worst-case and alternative accidental releases;\n\n* Prevention program that includes safety precautions and maintenance, monitoring, and employee training measures; and\n\n* Emergency response program that spells out emergency health care, employee training measures and procedures for informing the public and response agencies (e.g. the fire department, LEPC) should an accident occur.\n\n\nBy June 21, 1999, a summary of the facility's risk management program (known as a \"Risk Management Plan\" or \"RMP\") must be submitted to EPA, which will make the information publicly available.  The plans must be revised and submitted every five years.\n\nThe Risk Management Program is about reducing chemical risk at the local level.  This information helps local fire, police, and emergency response personnel (who must prepare for and respond to chemical accidents), and is useful to citizens in understanding the chemical hazards in communities.  EPA anticipates that making the RMPs available to the public stimulates communication between industry and the public to improve accident prevention and emergency response practices at the"

No releases caused any of the following:\n\n* An injury requiring medical treatment due to direct exposure.\n* Death, injuries, or significant property damage.\n* No known side effects.\n* No on-site property damage.\n* No off-site property damage.\n* No sheltered-in-place order.\n\n\n\nCHLORINE - HANDLE WITH CARE\n\nChlorine is commonly used in the water industry to purify water.  When handled correctly, chlorine is beneficial to the water treatment process.  When handled incorrectly, chlorine can be a deadly chemical impacting not only employee safety, but also the safety of the surrounding community.  Chlorine at the Huntington Water Treatment Plant is stored in 1-ton cylinders.  Special caution is always taken when handling chlorine, especially during the process of connecting or disconnecting chlorine cylinders.\n\n* Information about Chlorine\n\nChlorine is a hazardous material that is a greenish-yellow gas at room temperature and pressure, and a liquid when stored under pressure.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water.  Chlorine is heavier than air and will seek low-lying areas.  When combined with water or moisture, chlorine can form hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid.   Chlorine also supports combustion of certain substances.  Chlorine is also a health hazard.  For exposure to eyes or skin, flush with large amounts of water.  For inhalation exposure seek medical treatment.  MSDS sheets are on file.\n\n* Required Personal Protective Equipment\n\nOnly properly trained and medically tested per"

Then remove nut.\n* Remove any dirt that may be in the container valve or on the outlet gasket surface.\n* Unscrew the yoke screw on gas feeder until the valve plate can be pushed all the way back.\n* Place 1/16\" thick washer over the gas inlet of the gas feeder.  Only use new washer.  Never re-use washers.  Replace the washer each time the container is changed.\n* Mount gas feeder on container valve by placing the yoke over the valve.  Engage the gas inlet properly with the valve outlet, and tighten the yoke screw.  Excessive tightening will squeeze the washer out of the joint and should be avoided.\n* Position strain relief, located on liquid trap of gas feeder, over lower ton container valve.\n* Open gas cylinder 1/4 turn and close immediately.\n* To test yoke assembly and washer valve connection for gas leak, fill a squeeze bottle 1/4 full of ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "r/Evacuation\n\n* A decision regarding whether to evacuate or to shelter affected outside persons is a difficult one.  Generally, even a significant chlorine release is likely to last, at most, 30-40 minutes before it is contained.\n\nTherefore, sheltering in place is the normal mode to be utilized during an emergency.  While it is unlikely that this facility could have a chlorine release requiring evacuation, nevertheless, we must be prepared for such an eventuality.  If it is anticipated that a release cannot be soon contained or is of a massive quantity, the evacuation option should be utilized.\n\n\n\nHANDLING THE EMERGENCY, CONTINUED\n\n* Notify the fire department and suggest that sheltering of residences for 1/2 mile be implemented.  The fire department will make the necessary notifications in accordance with the previously agreed upon sheltering plan.  Residences will be notified to shut windows and close any ventilation system and listen for further advisories.\n\n* Notify Huntington Memorial Hospital regarding the chlorine release so they may be prepared for such people who might show up with alleged chlorine inhalation problems from within a 2 mile radius of the plant.\n\n* Any injured employee suffering from chlorine inhalation should be sent to the hospital.  To the extent possible, the employee should be accompanied by another plant employee.  Notification to the family should be made as soon as practicable by a supervisor.\n\n7. ALL CLEAR\n\n* The overall emergency response coordinator is to give the all clear signal when the emergency condition is eliminated.
