The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Bulk Plant in Memphis are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Memphis Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as crop nutrients.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 56,078 pounds in each of our two 12,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. The facility has thirty-one 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, three 1,450 gallon nurse tanks and two tank applicators, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 269,740 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to meet the newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n5.
