Piperidine, in the amounts handled in our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Aurorium manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0092s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Material unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substance and process considered during the preparation of this RMP, and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:  The primary purpose of this facility is the production of specialty chemical products.  Piperidine is produced on-site in a 5,000-gallon capacity reactor. Piperidine is removed from the reaction system and transferred into the bulk storage tank with a capacity of 16,500 gallons.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility would be 28,000 gallons.\n\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario (WCS), as defined by the EPA, associated with piperidine (toxic substance) at this facility is a total tank failure involving the maximum inventory of the piperidine storage vessel.  A full, single largest vessel amount of 118,635"

      "SummaryText": "pounds is assumed to be released.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint is 2.6 miles.  \n\n\n4.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:  The facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA\u0092s Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.\tFive year accident history:  This facility came on line in September of 2001.  In the last five years, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of piperidine that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.\tThe emergency response program:  All facility employees have been trained to OSHA\u0092s HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level in order to identify the need for an initiated response.  Retraining is conducted annually.\n\n\tThe facility maintains a Release Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release.  This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  Emergency actions and response for flammable releases have been coordinated with the City of Pasadena Fire Department.  Annual updates to review these activities are completed with the responding agency.\n\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety:  The facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operation procedures."
