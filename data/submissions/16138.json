(Bunge) owns and operates a fats and oils processing facility located in Fort Worth Texas.  On site, Bunge has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance for refrigeration.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) '68.130.\n\nSince the quantity of ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, Bunge is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Fort Worth facility which includes three (3) major elements:  hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMPlan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Bunge.  The required RMP information was electronically submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the deadline of June 21, 1999.\n\nBunge is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this report, Bunge is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\nBunge is committed to maintaining compliance with the requirements of the RMP rule.  As such, Bunge will update this plan in the event of any of the following:\n7 Within 5 years of the initial submission date of June 21, 1999,\n7 No later than 3 years after a newly regulated substance is first listed by the U.S. EPA,\n7 No later than the date on which a new regulated substance is first present in an already covered process above a threshold quantity,\n7 No later than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a new process,\n7 Within 6 months of a change that requires a revised PHA or hazard review,\n7 Within 6 months of a change that requires a revised offsite consequence analysis as provided in '68.36, and\n7 Within 6 months of a change that alters"

Bunge produces shortenings, oils, and margarines.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary cooling for processing of the product.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the product storage.  There is approximately 26,000 pounds of ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n1.3\tWorst Case Scenario\nSection '68.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. \n\nAt Bunge, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of the largest vessel containing ammonia.  The largest vessel (7,300 lb) is assumed to instantaneously release the entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The ammonia will then volatilize into the atmosphere.  Modeling of this release was performed using a finite dispersion model based on the methods established by E. Palazzi et.al.  This method was used because it allowed the urban topography to be accounted for.  The toxic endpoint calculated was 0.69 miles.  This release would affect residential populations. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a one inch hole in a liquid ammonia line.  This failure will assume that 1,445 pounds of ammonia will released over 11.3 minutes from the roof of the facility (20 feet above ground).  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA'"

This release would affect the public if standing at the gaurd shack or the spaghetti warehouse parking lot nearest the Bunge facility.  \n\n1.4\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nBunge has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills. Bunge has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day to day operations.  All inspection and testing procedures are contained within this program and are issued as required to the Bunge-personnel for completion.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, alarms, and ammonia detectors located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n1.5\tFive year Accident History\nIn the past five years, Bunge is proud to report that there have been no accidental releases of ammonia as outlined in '68.42 of the RMP Regulations.\n\n1.6\tThe Emergency Response Program\nBunge's emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal Regulations.  These policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, the HazMat Team will react with the proper actions, as listed in the Emergency Response Plan, in association with the local fire department .\n\n1.7\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nBunge makes safety a first priority in its every day operations to ensure a safe working environment for all of its employees.  Bunge is committed to continuously improving the facility's safety and working practices through employee involvement and development.  To maximize the amount of safety and to make sure everything is in accordance with state, federal, and health and safety committee legislature, internal audits are performed periodically.

Recommendations from that PHA are being implemented which will improve the safety of the ammonia process as well as reduce the chances and magnitude of any ammonia spill."
