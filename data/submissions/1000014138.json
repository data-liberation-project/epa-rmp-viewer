      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nPOET Biorefining (formerly Michigan Ethanol) owns and operates an ethanol fuel production plant located Caro, in Tuscola County, Michigan.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, POET completed a risk management plan (RMP) for natural gasoline condensate (a.k.a. denaturant), which contains pentane in a quantity above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.  CARA?s previous RMP evaluated storage of denaturant in only one above ground storage tank.  The use of a second storage tank required the offsite consequence analysis to be evaluated pursuant to 40 CFR 68.36(b)and the update submitted pursuant to 40 CFR 68.190(b)(6).  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPOET is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant. The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is POET's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of denaturant, it is POET's policy to notify the Caro Sheriff & Fire Department and if appropriate, evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 30 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 1,273,935 pounds.  The natural gasoline is stored in two above ground tanks as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The d"

      "SummaryText": "enaturant tanks are located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a release of the full contents of both tanks in 10 minutes time, with wind speeds at 3 meters per second (6.7 miles per hour) and the temperature at an average high of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, which would be a very unrealistic scenario.  This scenario would be a failure of both natural gasoline (pentane) storage tanks simultaneously, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion with two phase flow.  According to ALOHAA?, a software tool developed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for use in performing off-site consequence analysis, an overpressure of one pound per square inch (psia) (i.e., 1.0 psia overpressure shatters glass) is never exceeded.  Therefore, the scenario was run at an overpressure of one-half pound psia, and the maximum estimated distance from the tanks is estimated at 1.1 miles.  Based on a review of aerial photographs, there are less than 400 estimated human receptors within a 0.1-mile radius of the plant and less than 50 human receptors which fall in the modeled overpressure of 0.5 psia.  The analysis assumed a release of 1,273,935 pounds of denaturant (the entire contents of both tanks), a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (6.7 miles per hour) and an air temperature of 102 degrees F.  As stated previously, this was an overly conservative approach in which to run the ALOHAA? model for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario\n\nAlternative case scenarios are a more realistic approach to any potential accidental release at the facility due to the fact that mitigating equipment and employee response, if applicable, is taken into account.  The alternative case scenario evaluated using RMP Guidance was a failure of the largest natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  According to ALOHAA?, the maximum estimated"

      "SummaryText": " distance from the facility's center to ten percent of the Lower Flammability Limit (LEL) for pentane (1,300 ppm) is less than 1 mile (1,615 yards or 0.92 miles).  Based on a review of aerial photographs,  the estimated number of human receptors within a 0.92 mile radius of the tank is less than 400.  The analysis assumed a release of 887,013 pounds of pentane in a diked area, since the POET tank farm is located in a diked secondary containment area.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this updated RMP, POET has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management, incident investigation and RMP compliance auditing are conducted on a regular basis.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPOET does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering in the last five years.\n"
