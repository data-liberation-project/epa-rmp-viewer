We have also gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of the neighboring community by developing an extensive emergency response plan. There are specific instructions for various types of incidents listed in the plan. We have 24-hour HAZWOPER training for our engineers and all employees have attended and completed the general awareness training. This ensures that our employees are familiar with evacuation routes and procedures in the event there is an incident. Evacuation drills have been conducted to check employee competency on the training and procedures set forth. Coordination with the Tacoma Fire Department and the Fife Police Department is and has been a vital part in our planning process. The Tacoma Fire Department will be responsible for coordination with other local authorities in the case of off-site evacuations, including local authorities for the Puyallup Tribal Nation. Our on-site visitors are required to check in and are notified of the chemical hazards and are encouraged to follow evacuation protocols, which have been provided.\n    Our facility is located at 2302 Milwaukee Way, Tacoma, WA  98421. We are a frozen foods warehousing facility that constantly is receiving and distributing products all over the Puget Sound region. We are currently holding 10,970.5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is used in our refrigeration systems. This facility is covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.\n    Our Emergency Response Plan, as prescribed under EPA's Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.95, covers the fundamental steps in responding to any emergency involving the leak of anhydrous ammonia from our refrigeration systems. Appendix A in the emergency response plan is the Process Hazard Analysis. This is used to help employees identify and recognize what events warrant the use of the Emergency Response Plan. From there they can initiate notification to t"

Section 7 of the Emergency Response Plan clearly covers all activities that would prevent an accidental release of ammonia. This section also contains a list of emergency response equipment and the inspection/maintenance schedules for that equipment. Training for all employees is updated annually to ensure continued safety and awareness. In order to maintain the effectiveness of the Emergency Response Plan, the Emergency Contact is responsible for conducting a review of the Plan at least once each calendar year. \nExtensive air modeling has been conducted for our anhydrous ammonia in the event there would be a release. This air modeling includes a worst case scenario and an alternate release scenario that are defined as the following:\n    The worst case scenario is defined as a total release of all stored anhydrous ammonia in our entire system in ten minutes. Using the OCA Table 9 we have determined that 10,970.5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia will travel 0.62 miles out from the center of our facility if the environmental conditions are \"D\" for atmospheric stability and variable winds at 3.0 mph in an urban setting. Although our facility is located in an industrial area of Tacoma, Washington, a complete release could impact the recreational areas around the Puyallup Waterway, the Puyallup Tribal Nation Center, and a  few residential neighborhoods. Our impact zone around our facility also contains land that is currently undeveloped and may contain some natural wildlife, however these are not specifically designated as wildlife areas. We feel that wind conditions and prevention techniques will help prevent harm to the environmental receptors within our impact zone. Due to the location of our facility, we would not affect schools, hospitals, or any prisons/correctional facilities. Commercial, office, or industrial areas in our surrounding area would be the most likely candidates for evacuation in the even"

This facility has a sprinkler system in the event there would be a fire and we also have refrigerated rooms with doors that act as enclosures in the event of an incident.\n    During our air modeling we evaluated many possible events that would warrant an alternate release and have chosen one with the largest distance to endpoint as a conservative means for emergency response. We determined our alternate release scenario to be a plane or truck crashing into the condensers outside, with an immediate release. This scenario is relevant, as McChord Airforce Base is located Down the I-5 corridor from us and we have a large quantity of trucks operating to move out our products. Two pipes would be involved that are 5 inches in diameter, with each pipe having 120 pounds of pressure. The release would occur over a period of 10 minutes causing 1,870 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to be released. This modeling was conducted using the SLAB method of air modeling with an atmospheric stability of \"E\" and with a wind speed of 1.5 mph in an urban setting. We have determined the distance to endpoint to be a radius of 0.47 miles from the center of the facility. The impact zone is much smaller in our alternate case and consequently impacts major commercial, office, or industrial areas, but limits the number of residences due to the location of our facility.. No specified parks are located in this alternate impact zone, however undeveloped land that may contain some natural wildlife is in the zone. The Puyallup Waterway would still be within our impact zone. As part of our prevention plan we have refrigerated rooms with doors that act as enclosures, sprinkler systems in case of a fire, and emergency shutdown systems in our facility. These systems greatly reduce the chance of a prolonged release as well as our sophisticated technology shutoff system. Process area detectors have been installed for the further safety of our employees.  \n    In both the worst case and the"
