Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at McCall Farms are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Howe Springs Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 9,950 pounds.\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process ope"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\n\nMcCall Farms has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nMcCall Farms carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at McCall Farms to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training to deal with the modifications.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, a"

Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis, in particular.\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, McCall Farms hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor?s safety performance is completed.  McCall Farms has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.    5-Year Accident History:\n\nThis is"
