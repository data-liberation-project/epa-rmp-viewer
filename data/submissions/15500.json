Also, as the operator of a facility at which substances may be used that in uncontrolled situations could cause harm to the public and damage to the environment, we will strive for environmental excellence with a commitment to continual improvement, pollution prevention and compliance with legislative requirements.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) is one of these programs.\n     Each employee in areas where the RMP is applicable will be knowledgeable of the related policies and procedures and the supervisors or a designated person is required to insure that they understand them.  Employees and supervisors are required to comply with our policies and are subject to corrective action in those cases determined to indicate willful violation.\n    A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation in the program has been developed as a part of our Release Prevention Program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119.  A compilation of safety information to enable Wabash Alloys and the employees involved in the chlorine operations to operate safety has been accumulated.

As a manufacturer of aluminum ingots its products are sold globally under its corporate company, Connell, Ltd, 1 International Place, Fort Hill Square, Boston Massachusetts.\n    The facility is located in Oak Creek, Wisconsin in the industrial park.  Its Dun and Bradstreet number is 17-436-3044.

Specifically, the site is located at 9100 South 5th Avenue, Oak Creek, Wisconsin.  The site is approximately 36 acres in size, and is located in a predominantly industrial area of Oak Creek.  The site is serviced with electricity, water, natural gas, and sewer lines.  The water lines, natural gas lines and sewer laterals enter the site from the west.\n    The surrounding vicinity consists generally of industrial and manufacturing structures.  The property is bordered on the north by railroad tracks, residences, and the former Perter Cooper Corporation; to the east by Lake Michigan; to the west by 5th Avenue, and the south by the former Allis-Chalmers (DuPont) site.\n    The western, active portion of the site is mostly occupied by the Wabash by the Wabash facility building.  Scrap metal piles, loading docks, and railroad spurs are to the east of the building.  Chlorine cars and propane tanks setting on paved ground are to the north of the building.  The area on the western side to the south of the building provides site access and is for employee parking.  The 12 acres to the west of the site are fenced.  Access to this area is protected by a locked gate at the western boundary.

      "SummaryText": "owned by Vulcan Materials a secondary aluminum smelter operation was constructed and is presently in use by Wabash Alloys.  The site was purchased by Wabash Alloys in June 1987.\n    The site process involves the sorting, grading, processing (removing organics via a rotary kiln), melting, and alloying of metals for sale.  As part of the sorting process, large aluminum scrap is shredded or crushed, and ferrous metals are removed using a maseparation process.  A dryer with a secondary combustion unit and baghouse is used to remove impurities from the aluminum scrap such as moisture, paints and resins.\n    The sorted aluminum is charged into one of three furnaces where the metal is melted.  Once melted, various additives are used to modify the composition and hence the physical characteristics of the metal.  The metal is degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the molten metal.   Magnesium is removed by bubbling chlorine through the melt to form magnesium chloride.  Materials kept on-site for the process are aluminum, magnesium, zinc, copper, silicon, sodium, beryllium, and strontium.  Approximately 8,000,000 pounds of these materials are on-site at any given time.\n    Once the molten product is prepared, the melt is either poured and cooled as ingots or sows, or is transferred to heated crucibles for shipment as a molten material.  Particulate emissions from the crusher are controlled with a baghouse.  The emissions from the dryer are treated first using a secondary combustion unit, and then with a baghouse.  Emissions from melters, ingot and sow molding processes, and dross cooling operations are controlled using a baghouse.\nGeography and Weather:\n    Oak Creek is located along Lake Michigan in the southeast corner of Milwaukee County and adjacent to the City of Milwaukee.

Owners or operators may use Census data to define this population.  The presence of schools, hospitals, other institutions, public arenas, recreational areas, and large commercial and industrial developments that can be identified on street maps within this circle must be noted.  The presence of environmental receptors within this circle must also be listed.  The EPA has defined environmental receptors as natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas, that can be exposed to an accidental release.\n    The worst case scenario for chlorine was decided as the complete rapid loss of 90 tons of chlorine during a one minute time frame. The following information was determined using the Automated Resource for Chemical Hazard Incident Evaluation (ARCHIE) model, based on the stability class D , 5.5 mph wind speed, and the IDLH level of 10ppm for chlorine.
