Sulfur dioxide is also used to protect the headspace (air space at the top of a vessel) of storage tanks and barrels.\r\n\r\nSulfur dioxide is transferred from one-ton cylinders to 6 lb., 25 lb., and 100 lb. portable cylinders.  The portable cylinders are transported to the point of use for injection into fruit juice, pulp and/or skins to inhibit unwanted microbial activity.\r\n\r\nNo chemical reactions or special process temperatures need to be maintained.  The process involves the simple transfer from a larger vessel to a smaller one.  Plant nitrogen is connected and opened to the vapor valve of the one-ton cylinder to assist in the transfer of liquid sulfur dioxide.  The amount (pounds) loaded into the canister is monitored by the operator observing the liquid level sight glass on the canister.\r\n\r\nThe operation is conducted outdoors.  A bleed line is available during portable tank filling.  A second bleed line is also available to purge residual sulfur dioxide within the transfer lines before hoses are disconnected.  These bleed lines are connected to a scrubber system which is continuously fed water.  Since sulfur dioxide is soluble in the water (forming sulfurous acid), no emissions are produced.  Clean water passes through the scrubber continuously, thus, the water discharged to drain doesn't become over saturated with sulfur dioxide and a highly corrosive acid is not produced.\r\n\r\nSulfur dioxide from a one-ton cylinder is injected into the must line containing juice to inhibit fermentation.  The feed rate is controlled by a mass flow meter and metering pump.  Sulfur dioxide is soluble in water and juice, so no emissions are produced.  The quantity of sulfur dioxide"

      "SummaryText": "coated stainless steel and insulated with high density foam insulation.  A small number of tanks have ammonia jackets installed.  The juice or wine stored in tanks without jackets is pumped to a shell and tube heat exchanger for temperature control.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle operates on the principle of the latent heat of vaporization and the transfer/absorption of heat that occurs as a result.  The compressors provide high-temperature, high-pressure vapor as ammonia vapor is compressed.  Next, the evaporative condensers remove the heat of compression generated when the ammonia vapor is compressed.\r\n\r\nThe result of evaporative condensing is a high-pressure liquid, which drains to the receiver and is made available for cooling via control valves to other parts of the system.  As cooling is required in chillers or wine tank jackets, the liquid is metered and pumped from the suction accumulators.  As the liquid ammonia passes through the cooling coils or chillers, it absorbs heat from the wine and subsequently expands and vaporizes as the pressure of the ammonia drops.\r\n\r\nThe resulting liquid/vapor mixture is returned from the chillers to the accumulators, where the liquid and vapor are separated to protect the compressors from liquid slugging.  Ammonia vapor is returned to the compressors to repeat the cycle and accumulated liquid ammonia at the bottom of the vessel supplies the pumps.  \r\n\r\nEmergency switches are located in the Compressor Area for emergency shutdown. \r\n\r\nThe system operating set points are +20 \u00a2\u00aaF S.S.T.
