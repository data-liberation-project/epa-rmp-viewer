This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Trinity's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields as well as on site and sent to the Burnside Facility for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), natural gas liquids (NGL's) and water. These impurities are brought into specification before residue companies purchase the gas. Burnside Facility inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\n\n\n\nThe facility is designed to remove CO2 from liquid product with a solution of amine and water.  Once the liquids are treated with amine, product is sweet and any entrained water/amine is removed using coalescer type filters. The amine unit operates in a continuous loop treating, regenerating, cooling and back to treating. This system is highly automated and operates with minimal interruptions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to amine treating the Burnside Facility uses glycol dehydration to remove any excess water in the inlet gas. Excess water is sent to the produced water tanks on site which are trucked out. A small cryo plant is in place to remove any natural gas liquids which are sent to the NGL bullet tanks near the entrance of the facility which are also trucked out of the facility. \n\n\n\nResidue gas, after liquid removal, is sent to compres"

The facility contains three sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; propane refrigerant, plant gas consisting of mostly methane, and condensate. \n\n\n\n \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nProcesses at the Burnside Facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program 2 (RMP) regulation. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\n\n\nTrinity River Energy keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The Burnside Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the de"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\n\n\nTrinity River Energy has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nTrinity River Energy primarily used the hazard analysis checklist to perform this evaluation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Burnside Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nBurnside Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Burnside Facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Burnside Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nTrinity River Energy promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Trinity River Energy periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted on a periodic basis.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Burnside Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\n \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Burnside Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Burnside Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Burnside Facility is coordinated with the Yazoo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Burnside Facility has around-the-clock communications capability.  Trinity River Energy operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Trinity River Energy conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Burnside Facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to Trinity River Energy personnel the Burnside Facility has had no accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\n"
