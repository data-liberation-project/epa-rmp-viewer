Support for this goal is manifested in a number of ways such as:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tA corporate Health, Safety and Environmental department staffed with trained professionals.\r\n\u00bf\tTraining programs in chemical safety, accident prevention and emergency response.\r\n\u00bf\tPrompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\r\n\u00bf\tAdherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping of materials.\r\n\u00bf\tAudits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\r\n\r\nThe Havana facility is a chemical distribution warehouse that handles a number of materials used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  For example, Hawkins supplies bleach used in disinfection at food processors and health facilities.  Among our disinfection chemicals is chlorine which is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).  The facility also handles sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nAccident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping, storage and use.  This starts with DOT approved cylinders that are robustly designed to contain chemicals through all conditions expected during processing as well as mishandling that could cause a cylinder to fall or shift during transport.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures, and they are provided with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.\r\n\r\nWe also follow industry standards, such as those of the Chlorine Institute, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThis"

Therefore, there is no accident history to date.  \r\n\r\nIn the event of a minor leak, employees are trained how to detect the source and take appropriate action such as tightening a valve.  If a larger accident should occur, Hawkins employees are trained to call in the local fire department that is familiar with our operations.  We have on site a special recovery vessel into which a leaking container can be inserted to contain any further release.\r\n\r\nWhile Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than continued compliance to industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to Zero Can Be Done."
