The community may use them in case of severe weather, chemical accidents, or any situation requiring action.\n\nPlanning - Complete plans are a must to help guide people and resources in the event of an emergency.  The Aberdeen Plant has Emergency Action Plans (EAP) in place to handle on-site and off-site incidents.  Our plans have been developed in coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\nAlliances - To provide for additional resources in the event of a major incident, the Aberdeen Plant has agreements with the Aberdeen Fire Department and local emergency medical responders to provide additional resources if required.  These potential responders are given tours of the plant and are familiarized with processes at the plant in the event they are called on to provide assistance."

Many changes, both operational and procedural, have been made since, in an attempt to decrease the likelihood of events such as this occurring.\n\nThe Aberdeen Plant is proud of the fact that we have never experienced any release resulting in damage to our neighbors.  With our safety systems and employees working every hour, every day, to prevent chemical accidents, we are confident of extending this record of safe operation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\nThe Aberdeen Plant strives to be able to respond to any situation.  To accomplish this goal, our emergency preparedness efforts focus on four areas:\n\nPersonnel - The most important part of any response plan is well-trained, qualified people such as Aberdeen's Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The team consists of employees from various departments within the plant.  They train annually at places such as the Mississippi State Fire Academy.  On-site training is conducted regularly to test and refine the skills acquired at those facilities.  The ERT members have specialized training in firefighting, hazardous materials handling, confined space rescue and medical training.\n\nResources - The proper equipment is a necessary requirement for any job.  In the field of emergency response, it is necessary that equipment, materials, and labor be available immediately as needed.  The Aberdeen Plant is equipped with such items as chemical transportation response equipment, automatically activated fire water systems, portable fire water monitors, firefighting gear, fire extinguishers and other necessary equipment.\n\nAlthough it is hoped they will never be necessary, the Aberdeen Plant has provided sirens to alert the community to off-site emergencies.  These sirens are located in the community and"

For this scenario, impact is limited to circle, centered around the vessel, with a radius of 0.2 miles.    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The alternate-case scenario for Chlorine assumes that a one-ton cylinder releases all contents within 15 minutes.  For this scenario, impact is limited to a 0.2 mile radius originating at the release.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nAccident prevention is a large part of everyone's job at the Aberdeen Plant.  We work hard to make sure that our systems, procedures and people are all working together to prevent accidents from occurring.  To ensure safe operations of our plant, we have many systems in place including:\n\nEngineering Controls:\nStationary air monitors\nIncinerators for combusting vapors\nEmergency shut down procedures\nDistributive control systems\nStructural fireproofing\nBack-up power supply\nAutomatic water spray systems\nRelief valves for excess pressure\nTank containment systems\n\nOperations:\nQualified personnel\nDetailed training courses\nThorough operating procedures\n24-hour instrument monitoring\nAll changes or work on equipment includes a complete review\nRoutine audits ensure safe work\nRegular inspections of equipment\nIncident reporting and investigations\n\nMaintenance:\nPreventative and predictive maintenance programs\nVibration monitoring\nInfrared thermography\nCorrosion monitoring programs\nDe"

For flammable releases, the company is required to define the impacted areas within which one would see a shock wave of 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure, or in other words a wave significant enough to cause damage such as shattering of windows and partial demolition of houses.\n\nThe likelihood of a worst-case scenario is extremely remote and is of limited value for planning purposes.  This scenario defines the largest possible impacted zone.\n\nVCM is unloaded from railcars and is stored in a spherical tank, which is filled to only 90% of the 5 million pounds VCM capacity.  If the vessel was completely full, ruptured, none of the safety systems functioned properly, it was a hot day and all the liquid vaporized in ten minutes, the atmospheric conditions provided sufficient oxygen without dispersing the vapor cloud, a spark set off an explosion, and the maximum explosive yield was generated, the off-site area impacted would consist of circle, centered at the sphere, with a radius of 1.0 miles.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO TOXIC\nIn calculating the worst-case scenario for toxic gases, the EPA requires the assumption that the total quantity in the single largest vessel or process line (passive mitigation measures may be taken into account) is released as a gas over a period of ten minutes.  \n\nIn the worst-case scenario for the toxic chemical chlorine, a scenario in which the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder were released.

      "SummaryText": "The Westlake Aberdeen PVC Plant has a long history of safe operation in the Aberdeen community.  Our employees work hard every hour, every day to provide a safe workplace for themselves while protecting the environment inside and outside our fences.      \n\nPLANT INFORMATION\nThe Aberdeen Plant produces polyvinyl chlorine (PVC or vinyl) resins and compounds.  These materials are used in downstream operations to produce wire and cable insulation, vinyl siding, pipe, packaging, and numerous other similar products.  The resins and compounds are produced by the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  After the polymerization, the resin is dried and stored for shipping.  Most of the VCM used in the process is shipped by rail from the company's Louisiana operations.  The VCM is a gas at normal conditions but is kept under pressure and handled as a liquid, in a similar manner to propane.  At certain concentrations VCM is flammable, therefore the plant has many safety systems in place.  Both the Flammable Chemical Vinyl Chlorine Monomer and the Toxic Chemical Chlorine, which is used as a water treatment additive, have been addressed in the RMP preparation.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO FLAMMABLE\nIn calculating the worst-case scenario for flammable chemicals, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requires the following assumptions be made:\n1) Catastrophic (complete) failure of the largest storage vessel\n2) Complete loss of the contents of the vessel and vaporization of the liquid in ten minutes\n3) Mixing of sufficient air with the vapors to generate an explosion with a 10 percent yield-the worst seen for mixture of flammable vapors with air\n4) None of the plant's procedures or emergency systems work\n5) Ignition of the vapor cloud as soon as all the material vaporizes\n\nThe impact of these worst-case events decreases as you move away from the facility.  It is important to understand the standard measure of impact for determining the impacted zones.  These limits are dev"
