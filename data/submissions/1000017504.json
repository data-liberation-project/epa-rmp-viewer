The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g.  switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices. All parameters needed for proper operation of the OEC units, such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, power, speed, etc. are measured by the proper measuring instruments.  Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit. Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\r\n\r\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-pentane storage tank and on the OEC vaporizers and condensers. Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to atmosphere, and some installations have extension pipes installed to direct the relief valve discharge away from critical machinery. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with telltale gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks. \r\n\t\r\nVentilation System Design: All components of the n-pentane transfer and storage systems and the OEC units are located outdoors and well ventilated.\r\n\r\nSafety Sys"

The Brady Geothermal facility actively manages all operational permits and safety programs such as Nevada Department of Environmental Protection Air Quality, Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Underground Injection Control as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management. In addition, Ormat is ISO 14000 and 9001 certified and undergoes several audit processes to ensure all facilities are aggressively pursuing the highest quality, safety and environmental standards. Ormat is committed to handling the n-pentane systems in a safe manner to protect the environment. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses, Chemical Accident Prevention Program and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference.\r\n\r\nFacility Description \r\nThe Brady Geothermal Power Plant is wholly owned by Brady Power Partner's. The Brady Geothermal facility is located in Churchill County. The physical plant is located at 10750 EXIT 65, 1-80 EAST, east of Fernley, Nevada. The leased acreage covers the defined geothermal resource area and receptive injection zones.\r\n\r\nBrady consists of 3 steam powered turbines and one O.E.C (Ormat Energy Converter) each steam turbine puts out approximately 9 MW maximum (gross), and the O.E.C. puts out approximately 7 MW gross. Spent geothermal fluid will be injected back into the subsurface reservoir via two injection wells.\r\n\r\nBrady Geothermal Power Plant is operated by Ormat's Nevada, Inc. ()NI). The operating group (WNOPS) is comprised of management, administration, maintenance, engineering and operations personnel. The Brady Geothermal facility will operate continuously 24 hours a day and 365 days of the year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or pl"

In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119 the use of n-pentane as a process or motive fluid in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires the establishment of a PSMP, CAPP and RMP. The total projected amount of n-pentane to be stored on site is 68,750 pounds. \r\n \r\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been developed for the Brady Geothermal facility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC system. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals.\r\n\r\nAlarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufactures recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices.

Initial and refresher training, associated with the RMP program, is documented and maintained per the requirements of the Training. Additional training is also  provided as needed or requested by Emergency Services Personnel. Contracted employees, shall be trained in the requirements of the EAP procedure prior to working at the site. Training includes the following items, but is not limited to: (a) Location and sounds of the gas, fire, and evacuation alarms and detectors; (b) Expectations of response to injuries and emergencies by personnel on site, and in the Brady Geothermal Control Room; and (c) Evacuation routes and locations. Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\r\n\r\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Brady Geothermal Power Plant poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites.

The facility has a fire water system setup in a continuous loop around the generating units and within reach of the n-pentane storage tank. The fire water systems consist of fire monitors and hydrants. Operators are trained in the proper use of the installed fire protection equipment, and the training information is appropriately documented by the facility operator.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) including Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, an external events analysis and a preliminary human factors analysis was undertaken in July 2006. The recommendations of the PHA were integrated into the facility and facility operations. The PHA will be updated and revalidated at least every 5 years to ensure the study is consistent for the life of the pentane processes. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents associated with pentane and no accidental releases of pentane.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency. The EAP procedures apply to all personnel working at the Brady Geothermal facility.  The EAP is submitted to the local fire department for review and approval and when changes are made to the plan. Annual meetings are conducted to communicate activities planned by Ormat personnel and the response actions expected by the local fire department, and to coordinate potential joint response activities.
