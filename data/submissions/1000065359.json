Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nEnvironmental protection and enhancement are essential elements of TVA's integrated resource \n\nmanagement mission.  TVA exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its unified \n\nriver and power system for multiple public benefits, including the production of reliable, \n\ncompetitively priced power. TVA is committed to setting the standard for environmental excellence \n\namong utilities and federal agencies, and to making the Tennessee Valley a model in sustainable \n\nenergy, resource, and economic development and management.  TVA assures that employees are \n\naware of their environmental responsibilities; use effective environmental processes, and are \n\nheld accountable for performance.\n\n\n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental \n\nrequirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties. We \n\nwill assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and communities in which \n\nwe operate through proper environmental review of new developments and through safe \n\ntechnologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness. All activities will be conducted \n\nin accordance with current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nII.

Description of Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - TVA maintains documentation of safety information concerning \n\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs and specifications associated \n\nwith the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - TVA conducted comprehensive analyses of the process to ensure that \n\nhazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The Hazardous and \n\nOperability Study (HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the \n\nprocess.  The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, \n\ncontrol logics, and process operations.  Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The \n\nHAZOP analysis was conducted on January 20-21, 2016 and a pre-startup safety review was \n\nconducted on June 28, 2017.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting \n\nactivities within our covered process.  The procedures cover various operational phase including \n\ninitial startup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \n\nemergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. The information \n\nis readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the \n\ninformation is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\n\n\nTraining - TVA's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel \n\ninvolved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation \n\nand maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process. The personnel \n\nare provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - TVA conducts well documented maintenance checks on process equipment to \n\nensure safe and relia"

All maintenance operations conducted on \n\nthe covered process are performed by qualified personnel who have had proper training. Equipment \n\ndeficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - TVA maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process \n\nequipment, procedures and monitoring technology which assures that any changes meet regulatory \n\nrequirements.  Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are \n\npromptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new \n\nprocess. Established pre-startup safety review procedures assured that construction and \n\ninstallation of covered process equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a \n\nsafe startup prior to placing equipment into operation and all elements of the RMP are in place.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will \n\ndetermine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The audits will \n\nbe conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits \n\nwill be promptly and safely implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations - Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant \n\nrelease of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.  Procedures ensure that investigations \n\nare undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective \n\nactions to prevent the situation surrounding the release does not reoccur.

Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe ammonia facility is a new facility and thus does not have an accident history.\n\n\n\nV. Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous \n\nmaterials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response plan requirements including \n\nadequate first aid and medical treatment, safe shelter-in-place locations, notification of local \n\nemergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident \n\ndecontamination of affected areas.  The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent \n\nchanges within the process that would require a modification of the emergency response plan. In \n\naddition, periodic emergency response drills are conducted to keep employees, contractors, and \n\nlocal responders familiar with the plan.\n\n"
