Raw materials received in drum and bulk quantities are batch blended and packaged for sale. Both liquid and aerosol products are produced.  Facility SIC Code is 2899.  TCC is strongly committed to employee and community safety.  The facility's design features and operational procedures are intended to eliminate or minimize the chance of unauthorized releases of hazardous chemicals into the workplace or the environment.\n\n\n\nThe regulated chemicals utilized by this facility are butane, propane (AB-70 propellant), ethyl ether and difluoroethane (R152a).  The butane and propane are utilized in a mixture as a propellant gas for aerosol products.  Ethyl ether is used in certain product formulations in mixtures with the AB-70 propellant. R152a is used as a propellant and also has individual commercial uses.  Primary process elements of the propane/butane propellant, ethyl ether and R152a systems include bulk storage tanks, transfer pumps, blend tanks, aerosol charging (packaging) stations, and the associated piping.\n\n\n\nThe aerosol propellant gas is a mixture of propane and butane and is stored onsite in an aboveground tank identified as tank A-60.  Although AB-70 is a mixture, the nominal amount stored of propane and butane stored onsite each exceeds the threshold for RMP requirements.  The design and construction of the tank, pump, and transfer system is in accordance with applicable rules and guidelines of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Liquid Petroleum Gas Division of the Texas Railroad Commission, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is monitored and operated by employees of Technical Chemical Company who have been trained in facility safe operating procedures and the facility emergency response proced"

The amount of ether stored onsite exceeds the threshold limit for RMP requirements.  The design and construction of the tanks, pumps, and transfer system is in accordance with applicable rules and guidelines of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is monitored and operated by employees of Technical Chemical Company who have been trained in facility safe operating procedures and the facility emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nPropellant and ether are mixed in a closed pressure vessel system located in the tank farm.  The tank farm is equipped with concrete secondary containment structures.  The blended product is then transferred via welded piping to the filling/charging operation located on the south side of the production building.  The charging operation is continuously monitored by area detectors which are designed to identify the presence of explosive gas in the atmosphere.  At 20% of the atmospheric lower explosive limit (LEL), these detectors activate an emergency ventilation system.  At 40% of the atmospheric LEL, these detectors shut down aerosol charging and transfer activity and isolate the blend tank.  The system is equipped with automatic and manual emergency shutdowns at the bulk tank locations, and there is a fire suppression system located in the aerosol charging area.  The facility has developed procedures for unloading aerosol propellant gas and ethyl ether, and for operation and maintenance of the system to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  The release prevention program for the system incorporates the elements required by OSHA 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals).\n\n\n\nR152a is stored in a single aboveground vessel in the tank farm identified as A-4.

R152a is stored in a single tank located in the tank farm.

The system is inspected periodically for proper operation daily.  Walking inspections are conducted daily.  System operating parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in a release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with an early detection system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room and refrigerated spaces.  The system has an emergency shutdown station located outside the engine room.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.

The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan includes notification and alarm procedures to evacuate the facility and notify the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), and the National Response Center (NRC) in the event of an accidental release, as required by regulation.  The facility conducts employee training and drills in the emergency procedures periodically.  The facility is inspected annually by the local fire department.  No significant releases of regulated chemicals have been experienced by the facility in the five years previous to this submittal.\n\n\n\nThe facility has authorization for air emissions under a Texas New Source Review (NSR) permit and various permits by rule.  TCC complies with the requirements of the Emergency Planning Community Right to Know Act including Sections 312 (Tier 2 Inventory) and Section 313 (Toxic Release Inventory).\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe prevention plan includes routine and periodic inspections and audits of the process and prevention programs to identify potential deficiencies.  The Process Hazard Analyses are conducted initially, as part of major additions or modifications and every five years to identify potential hazards in the process and provide recommendations to eliminate or reduce hazards and improve process safety and efficiency.\n\n"
