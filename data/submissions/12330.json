Our worst-case scenariois the failure of the 12,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a gas release.  According the EPA's look-up table, the distance the the endpoint is 2.8 miles.  There are ......\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and ll applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with state law.\n\nFive year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries property or environmental damage, evacutation, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program.  In the event of an emvergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Valley City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.
