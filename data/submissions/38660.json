Solar Gas Inc. identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST professional version 5.01 dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow-Tang (BST) methodology for determining the RMP designated 1-psi overpressure contour.  According to the analyses, the greatest maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 470 feet from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in the Propane storage bullet when filled to the greatest amount allowed (246,415 pounds).  This worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor beyond property owned and occupied by Solar Gas Inc.\n\n\nWithin the past five years, Solar Gas Inc.has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the executive summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.  \n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief forme"
