This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.\n\nAll employees must complete a safety training program which includes materials published by the National Association of Gas Chlorinators and The Chlorine Institute.  Only employees who have completed training certification for Level 2 Technician status may transfer chlorine to 20 pound cylinders.  Additional safety equipment on site includes a ton container cradle device which allows ton containers to be rotated in place to assist in inspection and repair if ever needed.  In addition, the facility is equipped with a ventilation system capable of providing an air exchange of up to 15,000 cubic feet per minute.\n\nThe chlorine one ton containers,  the transfer process equipment, and the transfer cylinders, are all located indoors providing security management for all containers.  No filled containers are stored outside. This policy is in place to prevent vandalism, sabotage, and tampering. \n\nThe facility produces no hazardous wastes.  Every chemical by-product from the transfer process is reclaimed and used in swimming pool water treatment allowing no environmental wastes.  This business eliminates our customers' need to buy, transport, handle, and dispose of hazardous materials required for swimming pool water treatment. This provides a major benefit to the environment.  \n\nNo firefighters, police, or emergency response personnel have ever had to respond to a hazardous material release from this facility.  No firefighters, police, or emergency response personnel have ever been injured or hospitalized from a chlorine release from this facility or on the job site.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Splish Splash Pool Chemicals facility has been operating since 1984.

Splish Splash Pool Chemicals has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1984.\n\nSplish Splash Pool Chemicals' president is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The president administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe process is located at 519 West Lone Cactus Drive, #101, Phoenix, AZ 85027.  The chlorine transfer process for Splish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder. \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 12000 pounds.\n\nThere are four full time employees on site; however, there are additional employees that pick up supplies in the morning and are on the road all day.  They may stop back at the end of the day to unload the vehicle.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSplish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  Splish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. does not use any outside contractors at the facility; therefore, they do not have a contractor safety program in place.  In the event that they need to use outside contractors, a safety program will be prepared and implemented at that time.  In addition, common i"

      "SummaryText": "chlorine at the facility.  On September 4, 2001, at approximately 9:00 a.m., a one-ton container valve failed to close properly following the transfer of chlorine from the one-ton container to a 20 lb cylinder.  Over a 2\u00bd hour period,  approximately 4-6 pounds of chlorine leaked from the one-ton valve stem.  Splish Splash implemented their Emergency Response Plan, which requires notification to 911 and evacuation of all personnel, and approximately 60 people off site.  The Phoenix Fire Department was notified.  One technician onsite was treated for chlorine inhalation, which required oxygen and breathing treatments.  He was admitted to John C. Lincoln Hospital, and was release in approximately 2 hours.  The incident investigation that followed resulted in a procedural change to reduce the bleed time of the chlorine transfer line to 10 seconds to prevent rapid cooling of the one-ton valves.  Operators have been trained on this new procedure.  \n\nAs a precautionary measure, EPA was notified of the event.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSplish Splash Pool Chemicals, Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with the City of Phoenix Fire Department.  This plan outlines the personnel to contact in the event of a release.  The facility plans to contact 9-1-1 and evacuate all employees in the event of a chlorine release.  In addition, the facility can contact the chlorine supplier, Hill Brothers Chemicals in the event of an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSplish Splash Pool Chemicals conducted two PSM/RMP Compliance Audits (May 2002 & May 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (May 2004).  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
