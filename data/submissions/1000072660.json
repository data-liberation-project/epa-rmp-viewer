UET personnel have been given training on safety information including but not limited to the hazards of the regulated substance (butane), the technology of the process, and the equipment of the process.  In addition, UET has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safe use and operations of the transfer equipment.  UET will conduct periodic maintenance of process components, and will safely manage change to the covered process or equipment through the use of management of change procedures.\r\n \r\nUET has implemented butane transloader safety systems to include the following as required by NFPA-58: Emergency shutdown valves at the railcar with manual, ESD, thermal and excel flow activation; Emergency shut down valves at the transport truck connections with manual, ESD, thermal and break away activation;  Sight glass/check valves; ESD air dump valves (5 total) on each corner at the ground level as well as on the railcar working platform;  B.A.S.E engineering shutdown system for remotely activating shutdown of equipment and safety valves; temperature rated air lines for additional shutdown method in case of fire; two 20 lb ABC fire extinguishers; pressure and hydrostatic relief valves; static bonding (grounding) cables; signage, and engine over speed protection.  \r\n\r\nThe Five-Year Accident History:  This is a new process with startup planned in September 2018, since this is a new process there have been no accidents resulting in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or any offsite deaths, injuries"

UET plans to start operations in September 2018 to operate a bulk chemical and material transfer facility to offload materials from rail cars to appropriate tanker trucks.  \r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Executive Summary has been prepared for the offloading of butane.  This facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 due to the quantities of butane in the rail car storage onsite during the transfer operations.  \r\n\r\nThe process at UET includes bulk transfer of butane from a stationary rail car to an appropriate empty LPG transport truck.  Only one rail car will be offloaded at a time.  The maximum inventory can never exceed the quantity of butane that was originally in the railcar.  The rail car capacity is 30,000 gallons of butane.  UET expects as many as 15 railcars may be spotted on the leased siding at one time, and therefore the maximum butane inventory available onsite is 450,000 gallons.  \r\n\r\nAll materials used in construction of the new process (including soft-goods) are compatible with LPG as required by NFPA-58.  Materials of construction for the butane railcar offloading process are generally carbon steel, with stainless steel and brass used on a select number of items.  Material call-outs' are listed on the P&ID for piping and valve components.  Additional details regarding specific items of equipment, valves and other components are included onsite in the office.  \r\n\r\nUET has developed written programs, conducted the initial PHA, trained personnel, and conducted the required PSSR as required for a Program 3 process subject to 40 CFR 68.  UET has also conducted process and program inspections to insure that the preventative measures needed to safely manage the transfer operations for butane are practiced. \r\n\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the stationary source: The to"
