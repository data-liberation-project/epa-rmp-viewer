      "SummaryText": "Repauno Products, L.L.C., is a chemical production facility located in Gibbstown, New Jersey.  As part of its production processes, Repauno stores and uses two regulated substances in excess of threshold quantities.  Repauno complies with the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) Rule (N.J.A.C. 7:31), OSHA's process safety management (PSM) regulation (29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA Risk Management Program Rule (40 CFR 68).\n \nUnder the Risk Management Program, processes subject to OSHA PSM must comply with Program 3 requirements.  Program 3 requirements include a Hazard Assessment Analysis, a Program 3 Prevention Program and an Emergency Response Program.  Repauno has three Program 3 processes that involve regulated substances.  One process includes sodium nitrite (SN) production.  The end product is packaged for resale to other manufacturing companies.  The other two processes involve the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe sodium nitrite process involves regulated substance quantities of ammonia.  Ammonia is burned over platinum gauze at approximately 730?C to form nitric oxide.  The nitric oxide reacts with a caustic/water solution to produce a sodium nitrite solution.  Sodium nitrite is used for numerous chemical processes, printing and dye products, rubber chemicals, metal coating, agricultural products and food additives or corrosion inhibitors. \n\nOne aspect of the RMP is a five-year accident history. Repauno Products, LLC has had one reportable accident in the past five years.  This accident was caused by equipment failure and resulted in one employee injury.  The equipment was upgraded and new process controls were implemented based on the results of the accident investigation.\n\nAnother element of a RMP is the Program 3 Prevention Program, (Subpart D of 40 CFR 68) which includes process safety equipment, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident i"

It includes data on each process and every chemical and piece of equipment in that process.  Process manuals, maintained in the main office and throughout the plant, provide a description of each process including a block flow diagram, information on process chemistry, maximum inventory of the EPA regulated chemical, and safe upper and lower operating limits.  MSDS (material safety data sheet) are available and accessible by all employees, for every chemical on site.  MSDS sheets provide information such as toxicity, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability and the hazardous effects of inadvertently mixing the substance with other materials.  Each piece of equipment is documented through piping and instrumentation drawings (P&IDs) showing electrical classification, relief system design, design codes and standards employed, and safety systems.  These drawings are maintained in the drawing room, which is accessible to all personnel.  \n \nProcess hazard analysis (PHA) is another component of the prevention program. A PHA was completed for each process in response to potential hazards.  Failure mode and effects analysis and fault tree techniques were used to determine and evaluate the hazards of the processes.  A team consisting of an outside consulting company and key Repauno personnel completed the PHA.  It is updated every five (5) years and previous PHA's are stored for the life of the process.   \n\nTraining is another component of the prevention program.  All Repauno employees have up-to-date training on all processes, procedures and associated hazards.  Documentation of training is maintained in individual personnel files.\n\nMechanical integrity is another component of the prevention program.  Mechanical integrity is ensured and documented through Repauno's ma"

The maintenance manual provides the written procedures for the on-site expertise to handle routine maintenance, inspections, tests and emergency repairs and the computer system tracks all work that is performed along with reminding personnel when to conduct such inspections or tests.\n\nOperating procedures are another component of the prevention program.  Procedures for startup and shutdown for both normal and emergency operations are found in the Sodium Nitrite Solution Manual.\n\nManagement of change (MOC) and pre-startup procedures are components of the prevention program.  MOC procedures for making major changes in the process are documented so that consistent procedures are followed.  Pre-startup procedures are used to ensure safety before the introduction of regulated substance to a process.  Both are addressed in Repauno's Process Safety Manual (PSM).\n \nCompliance audits are another component of the prevention program.  At Repauno, compliance audits are conducted annually by a TCPA inspector.  Findings of the inspection are documented in a report, corrective actions are taken and all documentation is retained on file for future reference.  \n\nEmployee participation is another component of the prevention program.  The written plan of action regarding the implementation of the employee participation is described in the PSM Manual.  Repauno involves its employees in the on-going development of PHA's.  All employees are allowed access to this information as well as other information required under the RMP rule.\n\nHot work permits are another component of the prevention program.  A sample of a hot work permit (flame permit) and procedures for issuing such a permit are found in the Repauno Safety How Manual.     \n\nIncident investigation is another component of the prevention program.

If contractors perform maintenance or repair, major renovations or specialty work on site, Repauno ensures that they have adequate training (with documentation) needed for the job at hand and that they know the potential on-site hazards and the applicable emergency procedures.  A questionnaire is to be filled out before work is done on site.   \n\nThe last element of a RMP is an Emergency Response Program (Subpart E of 40 CFR 68).  Repauno's Emergency Response Plan and Valero Refining's Emergency Response Plan both incorporate Gibbstown Volunteer Fire Department, through a 911 system, to respond to an emergency.  Employees are also trained in emergency procedures.  Periodic training and regularly conducted emergency response drills ensure that Repauno personnel are current with appropriate procedures and changes in regulations.\n\nRepauno is committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  We are continually evaluating our equipment and procedures to meet this objective."
