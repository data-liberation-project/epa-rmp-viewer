      "SummaryText": "\nThe Reddy East Point facility located in East Point, Georgia manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution.  The facility utilizes approximately 30,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage.\n\nThe facility has two refrigeration systems with standard refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as its refrigerant.  The systems are referred to as the \"Turbo\" and \"Tube\" systems. Each of the systems has numerous protective controls (motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and low oil pressure) that will shut down the compressor if operating limits are violated.\n\nThe Turbo system consists of six 100-ton TIGAR Turbo icemakers and handles all the plant refrigeration requirements.  The system consists of four compressors; two 700 HP driven Frick screw compressors, one 400 HP driven Dunham Bush screw compressor, and one 300 HP driven Frick screw compressor.  An RWB II Plus Panel provides control for each of the compressors, inclusive of a standard 3-phase starter system with safety shutdown features utilizing normal refrigeration pressure controls and cutout protection.  The four Turbo system compressors are economized and maintain a suction pressure of approximately 12 psi on the ice maker and refrigeration evaporators.\n\nThe system compresses the anhydrous ammonia gas to a pressure of approximately 160 psi and discharges the gas into five water evaporative condensers located on the roof of the engine room which houses the compressors.  As the gas is liquified in the condensers, it flows into a pilot vessel, holding approximately 1000 pounds at 160 psi, where float switches control solenoid valves which allow the liquid to flow into a medium pressure receiver.  This receiver maintains a pressure of near 47 psi and contains a level of approximately 9 feet (10,000 pounds) of refrigerated ammonia at 32  F.\n\nThe medium pressure vessel serves as the anhydrous ammonia supply storage.

Float controls maintain approximately 9 feet (10,000 pounds) of refrigerated ammonia at 0 F and 15 psi in this accumulator.  This refrigerated anhydrous ammonia supply is pumped to the ice maker and refrigeration evaporators.  Sensors monitor output pressure from the ammonia pumps and regulate frequency inverters that control the pump motor speed.  This process continues as long as the system is operating.\n\nThe Tube system consists of four 40-ton Cassco tube ice makers equipped with two 200 HP Frick screw compressors and two Micom reciprocating compressors with 75 and 100 HP, respectively.  The two Frick compressors are operated by an RWB II Plus control panel and the two Micom compressors have a standard 3-phase starter with standard safety shutdown features utilizing normal refrigeration pressure controls with cutout protection.\n\nThe Tube system compressors maintain a suction pressure of approximately 170 psi and discharge the gas into two water evaporative condensers located on the roof of the engine room, housing the compressors.  As the gas is liquified in the condensers it flows back to a high-pressure receiver (approximately 5,000 pounds at 170 psi) located in the engine room.  As required, liquid anhydrous ammonia from the receiver is routed by pressure through the coils in the ice makers which pre-chills the liquid ammonia and supplies an accumulator (approximately 3000 pounds at 25 psi) vessel located above the receiver.  The refrigerated liquid ammonia is then pumped to the evaporator area of the ice makers.  This process continues as long as the system is operating.\n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to the facility to replenish the ammonia in the system, as required.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigeran"
