      "SummaryText": "ana and other surrounding states.\r\nPRODUCTS\r\nCyclohexylamine is used in water treatment, as a rubber accelerator, and intermediate in organic synthesis.  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to the employees of the company.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations.\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nBrenntag Southwest maintains emergency equipment specifically designed for use in an emergency to stop leaks from product containers.  Brenntag maintains employees who are trained in the specialized use of this emergency equipment and maintains agreements with area response companies equipped to respond to emergencies.  \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Programs in place at the facility include an Emergency Response Plan, Fire Prevention Plan, and a Transportation Emergency Plan.  These plans require the facility to maintain an open door policy with local fire departments and other emergency agencies in the area, and to invite emergency responders from both the public and private sectors to tour the facility annually in order to gain knowledge of the physical setup and processes of the plant.  This information becomes very valuable during an emergency incident.  These plans also direct the facility to maintain a working relationship with area clinics and hospitals in order to be prepared during an emergency event.   \r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nBrenntag Southwest, Inc. maintains Health, Safety, and Environmental policies for Risk Management, Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach, Hazard Communication, and Process Safety Management among others.  These policies require careful review of the hazards and determine the safeguards that must be implemented to prevent releases of regulated chemicals."

      "SummaryText": "In conjunction with these numerous training programs, the company also complies with container specifications, inspections, and testing requirements of the Department of Transportation regulations.  Still other programs such as the NACD's Responsible Distribution Program, and guidance implemented based on EPA's SARA Title III regulations along with BOCA Building and Fire Codes have aided the company in designing and operating a safe plant.  These programs and regulations coupled with company policy help to ensure the safe operation of the facility, protecting employees, neighbors, and the general public from chemical exposure. \r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\r\nThe Brenntag Southwest St. Gabriel branch has not had a significant release resulting in evacuation of the facility in the past 5 years. \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThis facility has emergency plans which are coordinated with local fire departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  For toxic and flammable products, the company's emergency response plans are based on information from the manufacturers of these materials. The emergency response plans for all company facilities include procedures for notification of potentially affected neighbors, the local fire authority, Federal, State, and Local agencies.\r\nSUMMARY\r\nIn order to continue to improve upon its safety record, Brenntag Southwest requires all of its facilities to conduct incident investigations, safety compliance audits, annual training on normal and emergency procedures, and community outreach actions that include: educating and training customers, fire departments, and emergency response teams.  These policies, along with improvements that have originated from internal programs such as the Employee Suggestion Program and external sources such as industrial associations, aid the company in its continuous effort to enhance the safe handling and storage of all of its products."
