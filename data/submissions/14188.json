This commitment is demonstrated by the resources devoted to accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained onsite personnel will respond to control and mitigate the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nClark operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (propane, butane, gasoline, etc.) from crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc., as well as hydrofluoric acid (HF), which is a regulated toxic substance.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe EPA-mandated worst-case scenario associated with toxic substances at the refinery is a catastrophic failure of a settler in the HF Alkylation Unit, resulting in a release of 235,000 lb of pressurized anhydrous HF gas over a 10-min period. Due to the location of the refinery, the toxic cloud formed by such an event will reach offsite public receptors. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe EPA-mandated worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing 1,810,000 lb of normal butane.  The tank inventory is assumed to release to the atmosphere, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosi"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe alternative scenario for HF is a partial rupture of an unloading hose from an HF tank truck.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off the flow from the truck within seconds.  For this scenario, however, we chose to assume that it takes 30 seconds to stop the release.  During this period, 169 lb of HF is released.  The toxic cloud resulting from this release would reach offsite public receptors.\n\nThe alternative scenario for flammables is a rupture of an unloading hose from a railcar containing butane.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off the flow from the railcar within seconds.  For this scenario, we chose to assume that it takes 2 minutes to stop the release.  Of the 5,800 lb of butane released during this 2-minute period 1740 lb is assumed to vaporize and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The overpressure created by the vapor cloud explosion will reach offsite public receptors.\n\nAlternative case scenarios are evaluated during a hazard analysis.  Potential situations are evaluated to determine the types of safety systems needed to prevent an incident from occurring, and to determine the appropriate emergency response actions needed.  The hazard analysis team then compares the potential situation to the existing system(s) to determine whether equipment or procedure changes are needed.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Clark refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA risk management program (RMP) rule are also subject to the OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation, this summary ad"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the refinery, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and refinery management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nClark keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets. This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters "

The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nClark has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nClark primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering experience. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\nThe team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. The team also assigns a risk ranking to the findings.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All findings are tracked until they are resolved. The final resolution of each finding"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained, and the findings are forwarded to management.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nClark maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process.  \n\nIn addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Clark has implemented a comprehensive operations training program for all employees.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (by testing) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level"

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nClark uses contractors to provide a broad range of nonoperating services, including pipefitting, painting, landscaping, and other services.  Procedures are in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Clark refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Clark refinery conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. PSSRs ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction has been properly completed and that support systems (e.g., procedures) are in place.  A PSSR involves a checklist review and field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Clark refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure"

Written procedures ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  When a deficiency is identified, the deficiency is reviewed with management to determine the appropriate course of action.\n\nQuality assurance is another integral part of the mechanical integrity program.  Clark incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Clark refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined"

The MOC system ensures that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Clark refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release that could cause major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  Each investigation determines the facts and develops corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.
