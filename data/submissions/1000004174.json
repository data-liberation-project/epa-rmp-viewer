      "SummaryText": "MORNINGSTAR FOODS, LLC\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nAnhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\nRevised May 2009\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nMorningstar Foods, LLC. (Morningstar) in Gustine, California, prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations.  The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Association (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\nMorningstar prepared the RMP/CalARP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Morningstar incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications.  Morningstar will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/CalARP/PSM. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Morningstar personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on support services provided by the local fire department and local hazardous materials response team.\n\nMorningstar is located in central California at 299 Fifth Avenue in Gustine, Ca"

      "SummaryText": "lifornia. The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses and residential development. \n\nThe facility was originally constructed prior to 1950. The refrigeration system was remodeled in the mid 1980s. Operations at the facility consist of the storage, processing, packaging, and distribution of milk and dairy products. The facility is staffed by a refrigeration operator or mechanic 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility. The system provides cooling for production areas, product, and water chilling. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP/CalARP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at a regulated facility. The Morningstar facility reported no accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years. \n\nThe RMP/CalARP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Many safety features have been incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Morningstar ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves that are piped to a common header which discharges into a 25,000 gallon water diffusion tank.  The common header has sensor monitors and alarms in the event of a discharge into the water diffusion tank.  \n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \nA?emergency shutdown systems\nA?component specific "

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program, and a RMP/CalARP/PSM auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are in place for the ammonia system at the facility. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nMorningstar is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.

Morningstar is scheduling completion of proposed actions from revised PHA dated May, 2009.  Management responses and support will be consistent with Morningstar's commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\n\nMorningstar recognizes that the RMP/CalARP/PSM Program is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility.  As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Morningstar continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community.  Morningstar will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations.  However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/CalARP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with MorningstarA?s internal review practices, and Morningstar will maintain the most current versions on site.  Thus, the most current version of the RMP/CalARP/PSM Program and related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."
