The facility has an ongoing effort to identify\nhazards, review safety techniques, and implement employee training\nthrough operation, maintenance and inspection procedures to manage the\nrisk of a chlorine gas release.\n\nB.\tThe Municipal Authority of Westmoreland County\u00c2\u00bfs, Connellsville\ntreatment facility was originally placed into operation in 1970.  The\nfacility currently has the capacity of treating 45 million gallons per\nday of water.  Gaseous chlorine, which is stored in a separate room, is\nutilized to disinfect the effluent prior to discharging to the receiving\nwater.  The amount of chlorine handled is ten one-ton containers for a\ntotal of 20,000 pounds.  The chlorine gas feeders are cylinder-mounted\nand are designed for conveying the gas under vacuum.  The chlorine\nsystem is inspected daily by the water treatment plant operating\npersonnel.  The facility is manned 24 hours per day.\n\nC.\tIn general, the Connellsville Treatment Facility\u00c2\u00bfs accidental\nrelease prevention program is based on the following:\n\n\t- Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\n\t- Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\n\t- Preparation of written operating procedures for safely\n\t  conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\n\t- Implementation of employee training program\n\t- Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques\n\t  and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\n\nAs an integral part of the prevention program, the Municipal Authority\nof Westmoreland County will perform a compliance audit at least once\nevery 3 years.
