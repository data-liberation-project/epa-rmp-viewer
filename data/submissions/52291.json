This certification is intended to comply with the 40 CFR 68.185 requirements.\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nRaft River Energy 1?s Cassia County, Idaho, facility is a geothermal power production facility. The Raft River Facility uses 183,000 pounds of the flammable gas isopentane in the heat exchange/electrical generation process.  Isopentane is stored at the facility in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold quantity defined in 40 CFR 68.130. The facility has been identified as meeting the regulatory criteria requiring submittal of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The objective of the RMP is to prevent the accidental release of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and/or the environment from short-term (acute) exposure and to mitigate the severity of a release that may occur.  \n\n\n\nTitle 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 68.12 requires a facility with extremely hazardous toxic and flammable substances used in its process in an amount exceeding a threshold quantity to develop and implement a RMP.  A process is defined in 40 CFR 68.3 as ?any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site move"

      "SummaryText": "ment of such substances, or combination of these activities?.\n\n\n\nBased on the criteria defining the three program levels, the facility was identified as Program Level 2.  There is one public receptor within the endpoint based on a worst-case release scenario, which was determined to be .47 miles. The Raft River Facility does not use or store regulated toxic substances therefore toxic release scenarios have not been prepared. Flammable substance (isopentane) release scenarios have been evaluated. The nearest endpoint receptor is a temporary residence for two individuals located .47 miles from the facility. The radius of impact from the worst case scenario is .5 miles.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains instruments and equipment to detect potential isopentane leakage and maintains emergency response equipment to remediate potential releases and reduce the potential for fire or explosion. Staff are trained to recognize and respond to potential releases utilizing computer automated control systems.  \n\n\n\nThis is a new facility with no five-year accident history. All accidents will be documented and investigated in accordance with the plan. Investigations will include an evaluation of the cause of the release and response protocols for the purpose of improving the physical responses and emergency systems that are implemented. \n\n\n\nAt the end of each major RMP heading section, a table correlating with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP*Submit requirements has been included.  These tables include the most current information regarding the Facility.  This RMP must be periodically updated when changes occur to the process, or when a new process is added which meets the definition requiring an RMP.\n\n\n\nTable 1 provides a matrix of the regulatory citation, the corresponding RMP element and the section of the RMP in which the regulatory requirement is advertised.\n\n\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis is comprised of two elements: (1) worst-case rel"

If you have more than one Program 2 or 3 process, you will report the worst-case release scenario for the Program 2 or 3 process that would have the greatest potential impact on the public (i.e., the greatest distance to endpoint). You may also need to submit an additional worst-case scenario for either hazard class (i.e., toxic or flammable), if a worst-case release from elsewhere at your facility would potentially affect a different set of public receptors than those affected by your initial worst-case scenario(s). \n\n\n\n2.

The worst-case release scenario is an analysis of how far away the worst possible accidental release from a facility would affect the surrounding public and environmental receptors.  This analysis is used to determine the facility?s program level under the RMP requirements.     \n\nThe EPA model RMP*Comp, version 1.07, was used to calculate the estimated distance to the worst-case flammable endpoint.  Model inputs include chemical type, quantity released, liquid temperature, and mitigation factors.  Isopentane is a flammable liquid and the model defines the worst-case release type as a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nThe facility uses 183,000 pounds of isopentane within its storage and power generation processes and is the maximum quantity released during the worst-case scenario.  The estimated distance to the overpressure endpoint of one (1) pound per square inch (psi), determined by the RMP*Comp model, is 0.5 miles.  The results of the RMP*Comp modeling assessment are provided in Appendix B of this document.   \n\nThe radius of impact, as defined by the model, is 0.5 miles from the power generation facility.  The radius of impact is depicted in Figure A-3, provided in Appendix A of this document.  As shown in Figure A-3, one residential receptor is located within the radius of impact.

      "SummaryText": "Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention Section 5.2 suggests that small facilities, with few employees, need only identify the one person or position with the overall responsibility of implementing the elements of the RMP.  The overall responsibility for the RMP resides with the Plant Manager.  At the time of this RMP development, the Plant Manager was Mr. Chris Harriman.  The Plant Manager may change without need for resubmitting the RMP.  Emergency response contacts and their telephone numbers are included in Table 1.1 Facility Registration Information in Section 1.0 of this document.\n\nThe CFR Part 68 requires that a Program Level 2 facility implement an emergency response program if site employees respond to a release involving a regulated substance.  The emergency response program consists of the following:\n\n\n\n* An Emergency Response Plan:\n\n* Procedures for inspection, testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment;\n\n* Employee training; and\n\n* Review and update of the emergency response plan with regard to changes at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program elements are discussed further in the following sections and Table 9.1.\n\n\n\n9.1    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe facility employees will respond to occurrences which may result, or are likely to result in an uncontrolled release of isopentane.  Facility response is necessary due to the potential for volatilization of a spill or spread of fire.  This section is intended to comply with 40 CFR Section 68.95.\n\n\n\n9.1.1 Procedures for Notifications\n\nIf a release of isopentane exceeds the response capabilities of the Facility, the following notification procedures will be followed:\n\n\n\n1. Call 911 to contact emergency responders;\n\n\n\n2. Evacuate facility personnel to a staging area outside of the impact zone identified in the worst case release analysis; and\n\n\n\n3. Contact and evacuate the residence located north of the Facility that is within the worst case release impact area.\n\n\n\n9.1.2 First "
