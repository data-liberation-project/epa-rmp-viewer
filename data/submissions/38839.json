It is used because it is an effective and economical product to use.  It is our intention to reduce the chances of an accidental release by reducing the amount of chlorine on site with the consideration of limiting  the number of times we handle the chlorine. The city intends to use safety equipment that includes vacuum regulators, chlorine leak detectors, and physical guarding to help limit the chances of an accident. We also intend to do the following:\n\n1.  To operate and maintain equipment in a diligent manner.\n2.  To train operators on loading & unloading of chlorine cylinders, hook up cylinders, and  a complete understanding of the    \n     chlorination system.\n3.  Maintain a preventative maintenance program.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nA chlorine leak in a horizontal 1 ton cylinder.  The tank is 70% full.  The opening of the leak is .36\" in diameter, and 1\" from the tank bottom.  The release last's 12 minutes at a rate of 201 lbs/min.  At 3 ppm the Max. threat zone is 1.2 miles to the end point.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nA chlorine gas leak is located in a pipe that is .4 inches in diameter and .8 inches long. The size of the hole is .13 sq. inches. Maximum release rate equals 6.52 lbs./min. The total amount of gas released is 391 lbs. Limited duration is 1 hour. At 3 ppm. The maximum threat zone is 354 yards.\n\n5 Year Accident History:  No accidents to report.\n\nEmergency Response:\n\nThe City of North Bend Wastewater Treatment Plant Staff does not respond to major chlorine leaks and will evacuate the area. The plant staff will react to MINOR LEAKS in piping etc. A second person always stands by during exchanging of cylinders.  If a minor leak develops the second person (with the SCBA) enters the area and shuts off the valve on the container.  "

(a visual cloud develops but the leak is isolated) The North Bend Fire & Police Dispatch will be notified for the purpose of informing the public.\n\nMAJOR LEAK:  If a major leak occurs then the Coos Bay Hazmat team will be the first responders.  Then 911 would be notified. The Oregon Accident Response System at 1-800-452-0311 would then be notified."
