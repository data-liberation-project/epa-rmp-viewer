The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plant\u00bfs safe work practices orientation.\n\t\n\t1.3.1.12   Contractors - The Plant established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant\u00bfs safe work practices, and the plant\u00bfs emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\t\n1.3.2\t  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\tIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\t\n\tGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered.

When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\t\n\tGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the Albany Fire Department to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\t\n\tThe safety program at the Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Albany, Oregon, which is referenced as the \u00bfplant\u00bf throughout the remainder of the document. The facility is located on 2190 Old Salem Road.  The plant was constructed in 1973. This facility consists of two plants: a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins, and the resin manufacturing process.  The formaldehyde plant includes the formaldehyde tank farm.  Overall, the facility employs 50 full-time employees.\n\t\n\tGPRI is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\t\n\tThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\t\n\u00b7\ta hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\t\n\u00b7\ta prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (cove"

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  GPRI ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees, the Albany Fire Department and the state emergency planning commission.\n\t\n\tMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\t\n\u00b7\ttoxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n\u00b7\tphysical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n\u00b7\treactivity and corrosivity data\n\u00b7\tthermal and chemical stability data \n\u00b7\thazards of mixing substances in the process \n\t\n\tMSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the process control room so that the operators have ready reference to this information.  In addition, MSDSs are made available to the state emergency planning commission and the fire department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\n\t\n\tThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used to (l) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, (3) evaluate process changes, and (4) help maintain the equipment.\n\t\n\t1.3.1.2  Process Hazard Analysis- The Plant performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the \u00bfwhat-if /checklist\u00bf in combination with HAZOP guidewords PHA methodology to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\t\n\t1.3.1.3   Operating Procedures - Plant process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operati"
