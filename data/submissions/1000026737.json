Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Anchor Warehouse Services - Porterville business practices\n\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter&copy; software to ensure that all necessary Anchor Warehouse Services - Porterville employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nAnchor Warehouse (Porterville) is a commercial cold storage for various fruit and vegetable products.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to fifteen (15) cold rooms equipped with evaporator coils for cooling product.  Five (5) rooms are designated as \"precooling\" rooms, while ten (10) others are cold storage rooms.\n\n\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted behind the bunker wall.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulators located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to a water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float"

      "SummaryText": " switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nAnchor Warehouse Services - Porterville has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Anchor Warehouse Services - Porterville facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the proces"

These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAnchor Warehouse Services - Porterville has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nAnchor Warehouse Services - Porterville's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\n\n?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n?    Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter&copy;, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter&copy; to create, schedule, track, and document events, Anchor Warehouse Services - Porterville has also entered into a contract with California Controlled Atmosphere to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of California Controlled Atmosphere's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Anchor Warehouse Services - Porterville now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Anchor Warehouse Services - Porterville employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Anchor Warehouse Services - Porterville will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. "
