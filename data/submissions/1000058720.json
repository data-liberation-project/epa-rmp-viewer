Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDel Mar Cold Storage conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Del Mar Cold Storage facility acts as a stationary source for regulated substances, anhydrous ammonia and chlorine. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in their operations and chlorine to disinfect their well water to be used in produce processing. To see a location map and site plan of the stationary source, refer to sheet T0.0 in Appendix A.2-Refrigeration System Drawings.\n\n\n\n2.1.    Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage, freezer storage, product freezing, and water chilling. There are five separate systems at the facility. The largest system with the potential greatest off-site consequence was started in 1994 and was constructed as per applicable codes and i"

System E (Spinach and Sprout Processing) is the only individual system subject to requirement for EPA RMP compliance. System E has 13,000 lbs ammonia which is higher than EPA threshold limit of 10,000 lbs.\n\nUpdated refrigeration drawings are located in Appendix A.2-System Drawings. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found within the equipment layout drawings. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix A.1, describe equipment details.\n\nThe refrigeration systems at this facility are either single- or two-stage vapor compression cycles operating at one or two suction pressures. In general, the process chemistries for these systems are shown in Section V.A.2. The total refrigeration charge is completely sealed and pressurized within the system.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4 for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n2.2.    Chlorine\n\n\n\nChlorine is used to disinfect well water, which is then used as process water. The chlorine is stored in 150 lb gas cylinders chained in a bin located outdoors next to the well shed. Only one cylinder is used at a time. The cylinder in use is secured separately with chain to a support system that is anchored to the ground. The cylinder in use is connected "

Once cylinders are empty, they are replaced and chained into another storage bin. The location of the chlorine system and a detailed P&ID can be found in Appendix A.2.\n\nDel Mar Cold Storage maintains one storage bin with full cylinders, where they will keep no more than (16) 150 lb cylinders at a time for a maximum charge of 2,400 lb of chlorine. Therefore, the facility does not exceed the 2,500 lb. requirement for EPA RMP compliance.\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas that irritates the respiratory system. Because it is heavier than air, it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials. Chlorine is detectable with measuring devices in concentrations as low as 0.2 ppm and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60 ppm. About 1000 ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system, and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. See Appendix A.4 for Material Safety Data Sheet for chlorine.\n\n\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nDel Mar Cold Storage maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation.\n\n\n\n3.1.    Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. Some mechanical rooms have emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room for "

Monitoring is 24 hours per day. Systems A, C, and E have emergency control boxes and diffusion tanks, which allows system pressure to be relieved manually. The relief valves in these systems are all tied into the diffusion tanks. Relief valves in Systems B and D are vented to atmosphere.\n\n\n\n3.2.    Chlorine\n\n\n\nChlorine injection system is located in locked and fenced area and access is limited to certain personnel. Cylinders are stored in bins and strapped with chains. All cylinders are under a shade. Chlorine injection system works under vacuum created by well water going through venture ejector. So if the water supply to ejector stops or vacuum is lost due to tube rupture or for any other reason, the spring loaded inlet valve immediately closes and isolates the gas supply.\n\n\n\n4.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to Del Mar Cold Storage personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia or chlorine resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix N.\n\n\n\n6.
