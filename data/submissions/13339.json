However, if there was a release of a chemical the employees are trained to handle this situation efficiently and carefully without risking their life, the lives of others, or the environment.  \n     The Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment Plant treats raw sewage and releases the treated water into the Pigeon River.  The treated water is disinfected with chlorine.  Chlorine is the hazardous chemical on the facilities grounds.  We store and use approximately 5 one ton cylinders of chlorine.             \n     The worst case senario was the release of all five one ton cylinders.  The area effected was 2.8 miles in radius.  This would affect shopping malls, schools, homes, creeks, rivers, and a lake.  However, detection devices are soon to be in place to prevent this large scale of a release.  The alternative scenarios was the release of 1 one ton cylinder.  This release would only effect the population in a 0.8 mile radius.  This release affect a creek, a river, and homes.  However, detection devices are soon to be in place to prevent such a release.  At this facility the alternative release would be a worst case senario.  This is why we chose this release for our alternative.  \n     The Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility complies to all OSHA PSM rules.  Also, the facility complies to the Sara title three rules.  The most important practice in our prevention program is training.  Also, communication among all employees pertaining to hazardous situations , and the immediate steps taken by the employees to fix the hazardous situation.\n     The Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility has been accident free for over ten years.\n     The Town of Waynesville's Waste Water Treatment facility coordinates with the local fire department and Haywood County's local emergency response commision.Training is conducted using the P.B.&S.
