The Anchorage Chemical Terminal utilizes these management systems to assure proper design, operation, maintenance, inspection, work permits, change management, and emergency response in a proactive effort to minimize risk to the public, environment, and the plant.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal employs 20 associates who live and work in the Baton Rouge, LA area.  In business at the same location since 1977, the company is a quality bulk storage/distribution facility for LPG-like chemicals.  Butadiene is shipped to companies around the United States, who in turn use the chemical to produce products such as tires, automotive parts, roofing materials, wire and cable coating, etc.  Propylene, which is shipped to companies in Texas, is a key ingredient used to produce plastic and rubber products.\r\n\r\nACT is a storage and shipping/receiving facility.  The chemicals typically stored or handled onsite on a day to day basis exceeding ARP threshold quantities include 1,3-Butadiene, Crude Butadiene, Chemical Grade Propylene, and Dilute Propylene.  ACT occasionally handles the following chemicals onsite that exceed ARP threshold quantities: Isobutylene (2-Methylpropene); 1,3-Butadiene (Stabilized); ST-04 Bottoms; Mixed Butylenes; and Crude Isoprene (aka Dilute Isoprene or Isoprene Concentrate).   Crude Butadiene, Dilute Propylene, 1,3- Butadiene (Stabilized), ST-04 Bottoms, Mixed Butylenes, and Crude Isoprene are flammable mixtures.  Crude Butadiene contains four regulated subst"

Chemicals are received via ship, barge, tank car, tank truck or pipeline and transferred to commerce via ship, barge, tank car, tank truck or pipeline.\r\n\r\n1,3-Butadiene, Crude Butadiene, Dilute Propylene, and Chemical Grade Propylene is stored in excess of threshold quantities and is therefore subject to the ARP Program.  Isobutylene in quantities exceeding the threshold is occasionally off-loaded directly from ships to tank cars. 1,3-Butadiene (Stabilized); ST-04 Bottoms; Mixed Butylenes; and Crude Isoprene in quantities exceeding the threshold may be occasionally unloaded from tank cars into the Crude Butadiene storage unit (Sphere 697) and transferred out via pipeline as a Crude Butadiene mixture.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because some processes at the plant meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Intercontinental Terminals Company has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program and this summary describes OIMS.  Further, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as form evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident sc"

Examples of associate participation ranges from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Associates have access to all information generated from HAZOPs and Site Risk Assessments.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives underway that address process safety and associate safety issues via the ACT Safety Committee which is comprised of site personnel and selected contractors.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The ACT Terminal Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the OIMS documentation to help associates locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has identified operating envelopes, i.e., documented safety related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained pers"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all associates involved in operating a process.  New associates receive basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (i.e., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations personnel periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site safety rules; and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) safety orientation; (2) information about safety and heath hazards; (3) emergency response plan requirements; and (4) safe"

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training; (2) developing written procedures; (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies; and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process; (2) safety and health hazards; (3) applicable maintenance procedures; (4) emergency response plans; and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is preformed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, associates will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\nAnother integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance.  The Anchorage Chemical Terminal incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure tha"

The purpose of the Work Permit System is to ensure that jobs are planned, equipment is prepared, personnel are informed to hazards and procedures, precautions are taken, and work is executed in a manner to protect safety, health, and the environment.  The Work Permit System covers hot work and other categories of work such as opening equipment, excavation, lifting, and confined spaces.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.
