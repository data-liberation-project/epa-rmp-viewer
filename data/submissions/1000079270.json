Health, Safety and Environmental compliance are fundamental parts of Farmers Coop of Tappen's commitment to the local area. Federal, State and Local laws are to be adhered to and are to implement appropiate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond by working with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to the area and to the general public.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled: Anhydrous Ammonia storage and distribution for use as a fertilizer on local crop production.\n\n\n\nContract temporary seasonal labor is used for maintance and for filling of nurse tanks.\n\nContract Labor is required to attend saftey and handling training annually.\n\n\n\nFarmers Coop of Tappen does not own Nurse Tanks.\n\n\n\nFarmers Coop of Tappen keeps inventory of anhydrous ammonia at minimal levels in the off season. (typically August through May is off season)\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the facility's release prevention program.\n\n\n\n1)Safety Information: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State Regulations. \n\n\n\n2)Hazard Review: Facility is reviewed for hazards associated with handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. Any problems identified during the review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n3) Training: Saftey and Handling of Anhydrous ammonia training for contract labor is to be attended anually.\n\n\n\n4)Maintenance: The facility inspects equipment, hoses, and piping periodically. Any probems are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n5) Compliance Audits: As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three(3)years.
