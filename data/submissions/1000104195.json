Accidental Release Prevention and Energy Response Policies\nEnergy Transfer and the Mont Belvieu NGLs Operations are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur at the Mont Belvieu South-Smith Tract Terminal, response contingencies have been developed and set in place with coordination from the Mont Belvieu Police Department, Mont Belvieu Fire Department and Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB).\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Mont Belvieu Terminal's RMP-regulated activities consist of storage and/or processing of Natural Gasoline NGL [CAS# 74-98-6], and the storage/transfer of propane [CAS# 74-98-6], RGB (refinery grade butane) [CAS# 106-97-8], n-butane [CAS# 106-97-8], iso-butane [CAS# 75-28-5], mixed NGLs (Y-grade), and diesel [CAS# 68476-34-6]. Natural Gasoline is received from Energy Transfer\u0092s Mont Belvieu Fractionation units and customers then further processed in the ORU (Oxygen Recovery Unit) at Smith Tract prior to transfer by underground pipe to the Energy Transfer Cedar Bayou Facility.  Propane, RGB and Diesel is stored in underground caverns at the South Storage facility and share the emergency flare with the ORU at Smith.  Under conceivable unlikely conditions the shared flare knock-out drum can possibly have Natural Gasoline, Propane, Butanes, or Diesel in quantities greater than the RMP threshold of 10,000 lbs. The V1110 Flash Surge vessel at Smith Tract holds a quantity of Natural Gasoline greater than the 10,000 lbs RMP threshold during normal operating conditions.\n\n3.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\u0095             Process Safety Information\nMont Belvieu South-Smith Tract maintains detailed records of safety information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\u0095             Process Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. Hazop, LOPA and What-if hazard analysis methodologies are used to carry out these analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of not more than five (5) years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\u0095             Operating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Mont Belvieu South-Smith Tract has written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\u0095             Training\nMont Belvieu South-Smith Tract has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\u0095             Mechanical Integrity\nMont Belvieu South-Smith Tract carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment t"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\u0095             Management of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Mont Belvieu South-Smith Tract to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\u0095             Pre-Startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Energy Transfer Mont Belvieu NGLs LLC. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\u0095             Compliance Audits\nMont Belvieu South-Smith Tract will conduct audits on a regular basis to confirm that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly and adequately implemented.
