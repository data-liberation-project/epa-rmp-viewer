The emergency plan includes arrangements for immediate response from employees, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  We conduct regular drills including joint training with Decatur Fire and Rescue and Morgan County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) to ensure the proper execution of the plan.  Further, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. The emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes in our processes that would require a modified emergency response. \n\n3M also participates in the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care Program.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAt 3M, we strive to continually improve safety.  These efforts include designing safety into the manufacturing operations to regular assessments identifying opportunities for safety improvements.  The primary focus in our continuous improvement program is an ongoing assessment for the minimization of the inventories of our hazardous substances."

If program deficiencies are identified, then corrective action plans are implemented to prioritize the corrections.\n\n\u2022\tIncident Investigation:  We promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a substantial release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent or minimize a release in the future. \n\n\u2022\tEmployee Participation:  At 3M, managing process safety and preventing accidents are team efforts. We strongly encourage employees to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  \n  \n\u2022\tContractors:  3M hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance. We have a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to our processes and the contractor's work.  Contractors are also informed of our procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.   \n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nAt 3M, no level of accident is acceptable.  We work continually to reduce the number and severity of accidents at our operations.  Within the past five years there have been no significant releases of regulated substances from our facility.\n\n6.

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\n3M Decatur, AL\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan of the 3M Chemical Operations' Decatur facility in Decatur, Alabama.   The safety and health of the employees and environmental responsibilities to the community are priorities.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility rooted in the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention, creating its environmental policy in 1975.  \n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the manufacturing processes and the proper training of all employees.  If, despite our best efforts, such a release should occur, the onsite emergency response personnel are trained to control the effects of the release. We also maintain an excellent working relationship with Decatur Fire & Rescue who can provide additional rapid and effective response. \n \n3. The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\n3M Decatur manufactures specialty films and chemicals for the use in making a wide variety of products.   Four (4) regulated substances are utilized at the facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  The following four (4) regulated substances are used at the 3M Decatur Site:\n\na)           Vinyl Acetate Monomer is a raw material used in the production of adhesives.\nb)           Propylene, Vinylidene Fluoride (VF2), and Trifluorochloroethylene (CTFE) are used as raw materials in the production of synthetic rubber and plastic products that are used in the automobile industry.\n\nAt the time of the 2023 resubmission, the inventory of Trifluorochloroethylene (CTFE) is not present at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity in 40 CFR 68.130 Li"
