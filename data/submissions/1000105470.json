This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the operator of The Wine Group - Fresno facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\n\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study on January 12, 2023, there have been no significant releases of ammonia or sulfur dioxide that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 or 500 pounds, respectively, or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the past five years (January 2018 - January 2023).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release.\n\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, conducted January 12, 2023, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at The Wine Group - Fresno facility.

The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of farmland and residential areas.\n\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of wine products.  In order to conduct operations the facility currently uses approximately 92,600 pounds of ammonia in its two existing ammonia refrigeration systems, and approximately 38,000 pounds of ammonia are planned to be used in a third system that is under construction (North System).  The two existing systems (Front and East systems) are connected by piping, and are therefore considered one process. The Front (West) System has an ammonia charge of approximately 60,100 pounds; the Back (East) System has an ammonia charge of approximately 32,500 pounds. The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of wine products. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n \nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n- Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n- In depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n- Written o"

Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter In Place plan would go into effect.  \n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc.
