This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Cadiz Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant where it is first dehydrated to remove water.  The gas is then sent through refrigeration dew point control units where the condensable liquids are extracted from the methane gas stream.  The liquids are then sent to the de-ethanizer to remove purity ethane, which is transported offsite via pipeline. The de-ethanized liquids are transported offiste via pipeline, or can be sent to one of several pressurized storage tanks awaiting loadout via truck.  \n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case accident scenario was determined by looking at several scenarios and determining which would have the greatest off-site impact.  Modeling using the RMP-COMP model shows the worst-case scenario is the release from an 86,000 gallon NGL storage tank.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario was considered as an unloading hose rupturing during transfer operations.  To be conservative it was assumed the flow would be unabated for five minutes until the valves could shut and flow ceased.  At a flow of 200 gallons/minute this would cause the release of approximately 1,000 gallons of NGL.  Using the typical NGL density of 4.422 lb/gallon, this amounts to a release of 4,422 pounds of a regulated s"

Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and elect"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nEach PHA will address the following:\n\na)    hazards of the process,\n\nb)    previous incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences,\n\nc)    consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls,\n\nd)    engineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards an their inter-relationships,\n\ne)    facility siting issues,\n\nf)    human factors.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are compiled in a written report and are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
