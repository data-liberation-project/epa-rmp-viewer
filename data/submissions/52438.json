Sherman is located 60 miles north of Dallas Texas in Grayson County.  Construction began in February 2000 and the plant was occupied in July 2001.  The facility consists of a two level administration area located between two wafer fabs.  The wafer fabs are three level construction.  The first level contains the chemical delivery systems and related support equipment for the process tools such as power supplies and controllers.  The middle level of the wafer fab is an 8000-square-foot Class 1 cleanroom environment containing the manufacturing process equipment. The third level houses the air handling equipment for the cleanroom.  Behind the administrative area on the first level are more support equipment such as chillers, a boiler, and equipment used to make de-ionized water and a Control Center for the utilities.  Behind the administrative area on the second level is the main frame computer room and wafer stock room.  Located outside are storage tanks for the deionization water process, an Acid Waste Neutralization system, a cryogenic hydrogen storage tank and an ASU (air separation unit) for producing nitrogen.  Also located outside are the bulk supply and distribution systems for anhydrous hydrogen chloride (HCl) and trichlorosilane (TCS).  Both of these chemicals are received from the supplier in quantities above the threshold limits specified in OSHA?s PSM program and the EPA?s RMP program.   Epitaxial silicon wafers are produced at this facility.  \n\nProcess Description\n    A thin (2-80 micron) single crystal layer of silicon is deposited on a silicon wafer.  The layer provides an ultra pure starting substrate for use by integrated device manufacturers to build integrated circuits commonly referred to as chips.  Trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) is the silicon source for the deposition.  The deposi"

      "SummaryText": "tion process takes place in an epi reactor at elevated temperatures high enough to separate the silicon atoms from the chlorine atoms contained in trichlorosilane.  The remaining hydrogen and chlorine atoms combine into hydrogen chloride.  This is the major byproduct of the deposition process and since it is hazardous must be scrubbed (treated) to state mandated levels before emission into the atmosphere.  Hydrogen chloride is also used to remove silicon that has deposited on equipment piece parts during the reaction.  An air permit from the state regulatory body, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), was obtained prior to construction of the facility.  GlobiTech is labeled a ?minor source? in regard to emissions due to the very small amount of HCl emitted after scrubbing.   Other processes associated with the deposition are wet cleaning of the wafers and parameter measurement such as electrical resistivity and thickness. \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nAnhydrous hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane are the regulated chemicals handled on this site.  Hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane are in quantities above threshold limits stated OSHA?s PSM and the EPA?s RMP programs therefore all required elements of each program are implemented. \n\nWorst Case Disaster Scenario \n    Worst-case disaster scenarios for both hydrogen chloride and trichlorosilane have been performed. An independent environmental consulting firm with extensive expertise in dispersion modeling performed the analysis using EPA recognized model DEGADIS.  In addition, EPA approved software RMP Comp was used internally and the results compared.  The DEGADIS dispersion model is much more involved and sophisticated and therefore more accurate.   These techniques are consistent with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency procedures. They are based on the U.S. EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, which defines the worst-case scenario as"

      "SummaryText": " the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint that serious injury from short-term exposure will no longer occur.  \nHydrogen chloride (HCl) is received in anhydrous form via tube trailer truck.  The HCl is contained in seven separate pressurize tubes with each tube containing 3000lbs.  Trichlorosilane (TCS) is received in a 3800 gallon (43000 lbs) ISO container.  TCS reacts with the moisture in the air to form HCl.  The IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) value for HCl is 50ppm. Using the parameters listed in the table below, the toxic endpoint for the rupture of one of the tubes was calculated as well as rupture of the TCS container.\n\n\n\nParameter    Value\nRelease duration (min)    10\nStability class    F\nWind speed (m/s)    1.5\nAnemometer height (m)    10\nAmbient temp (oF)    109\nRelative humidity (%)    65\nSurface roughness (m)    0.3\nReceptor height (m)    0\n  \nThe distance to the endpoint for HCl based on the parameters above is 2.7 miles (4.3 kilometers) using RMP Comp and 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) according to DEGADIS.  Recall analysis using DEGADIS is a more detailed and accurate.  For HCl due to TCS release the end point according to DEGADIS is 0.7 miles (1200 meters).    \nBesides Trichlorosilane (TCS) converting to HCl in the atmosphere it is also a flammable. Therefore a worst case flammable release scenario was performed using RMP Comp and the TNT Equivalent Model described in the EPA?s RMP Guidance.  The estimated distance to an overpressure of 1 psi was determined to be 160 and 196 meters respectively, which is in the confines of the GlobiTech facility.  An alternative flammable release scenario using a pool fire instead of a vapor cloud explosion was preformed and also shows the release to be within the confines of the facility. \n\nAccident Prevention Program\n    An Environmental Health and Safety specification titled Accident Prevention has been written and com"

In addition to the TGM, restrictive flow orifices and excess flow detection, low-low and high-high detection systems are in place with shutdown capabilities. The TCS bulk delivery area is further equipped with an AFFF foam suppression system and 110% secondary containment.  Any loss of exhaust detected at any gas cabinet or the process tool (reactor) a shutdown of the source gas will occur.  Barricades (bollards) are in place for both TCS and HCl at the outdoor gas pad.   \n    Air Products and Chemicals Incorporated (APCI) is an embedded contractor at GlobiTech.   A written agreement exists between APCI and GlobiTech stating ownership of equipment as well as ownership of the chemical.

A checks and balance system between the two companies insures the safest approach to chemical handling and processing is followed, maintained, and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The purity levels needed for an epitaxial deposition process demand the absolute highest quality materials, workmanship, and procedures.  This fact was known long before the initial design and was followed all the way through to commissioning the facility.  It continues with preventative maintenance knowing if the integrity of the system is compromised or breeched in any manner it is not only a safety concern but has damaging effect on business which cannot be tolerated.  \nAnother important step taken in regards to insuring safety was the hiring of an outside firm to conduct the Process Hazard Analysis for the TCS and HCl distribution system prior to construction completion."
