Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of BACKES & TOELKE are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Franklin County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.  Everyone is trained to know how to MITIGATE the situation, when to EVAUATE the area, which protocol to follow when RESPONDING, and how to CLEANUP any release should one occur.   \n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for that purpose.  \n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy for Anhydrous Ammonia: Our purpose aims to prevent accidental release of NH3 and ensure the safety of employees, the community and the environment by outlining preventive measures and emergency response procedures.  This policy applies to all employees, management and owners of the New Haven, Mo facility who work with or may be exposed to NH3.  This facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration Safety Managements Standards 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and Missouri State regulations covering anhydrous ammonia, EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule (40 CFR Part 68), Anhydrous Ammonia Safety Data Sheets (SDS).  Compliance inspections and maintenance are performed on ammonia storage tanks, piping, valves, and safety equipment.  Detailed Records are kept of inspections, repairs, and any modifications made to ammonia handling equipment.  We have consequences in place for de"

Management Responsibilities are to ensure that proper training, equipment, and resources are available to prevent and respond to accidental releases. Training to prevent tank malfunctions, overfilling a tank, carelessness, overpressure conditions, or physical damages is in place in our operational procedures when unloading a truck transport, loading a nurse tank, startup of the plant, normal shutdown of the plant, emergency shutdown of the plant, and restarting after an emergency shutdown. Emergency preparedness is a priority.  Employee Responsibilities are to follow all safety procedures and wear appropriate personal protective equipment. They are to report any leaks, spills, or unsafe conditions to a supervisor.  Participating in a regular training and emergency drills is mandatory.  \n \n4.  Five-Year Accident History:  There has been no reportable release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  All reportable ammonia releases will be discovered to the appropriate regulatory agencies in compliance with reporting requirements (EPA, OSHA).  If such an occurrence would happen, a thorough investigation of the incident to determine the cause would be conducted.  We would implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence.   \n \n5. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan.  Upon detection of an anhydrous ammonia release, employees must immediately notify the supervisor and the Emergency Response Team and activate the facility's emergency evacuation plan.  The company does not plan to have its employees respond to a major release.  If a major release of anhydrous ammonia takes place and a respirator is needed to respond, employees are trained that their response action is to evacuate the area of the release and call 911 and all other applicable emergency response numbers listed in the Emergency Action Plan.  Employees and management will assess the situation, determine the source of the release, and take immedi"

We will work closely with fire department, HAZMAT team, and local emergency responders to ensure coordinated response efforts. Medical Response will be to provide first aid and medical attention to any individuals exposed to ammonia, including decontamination procedures if necessary.   Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are available for anhydrous ammonia to provide to medical personnel.   \n6.  Ongoing Safety Improvements:  Safety is an ongoing process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the conditions of the facility and equipment. Any repairs needed are given top priority and completed as soon as possible. Regular maintenance of equipment and the facility keeps cost of repairs down. Cameras have been installed. Plant manager, Andrew Toelke, lives on the adjoining property.   Safety meetings to discuss safe handling of NH3 are conducted and employees are tested.  What if and emergency action scenarios are conducted to teach management and employees what to do in case of an accidental release of NH3.  We role play how to contact authorities in an emergency situation. We have created hypothetical scenarios and how to manage them.   Our local emergency responders, including the fire department and emergency medical services take on the responsibility on conducting regular emergency response drills and maintain familiarity with response procedures."
