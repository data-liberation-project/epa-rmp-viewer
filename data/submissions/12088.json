      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) wholesales drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants.  The MWDSC Chemical Unloading Facility (CUF) plays a critical role in supplying chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  The chlorine at CUF is received in rail cars and then transferred to chlorine trailers which supply disinfection processes at various MWDSC water treatment facilities.\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nThe CUF's chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident an"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nIn addition, all MWDSC chlorine systems have undergone a high priority evaluation for Y2K readiness.  They will be Y2K compliant by July 31, 1999, though no Y2K problems are anticipated.\n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The CUF has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department).

The facility is situated just west of Interstate Highway 215 and south of the Cajalco Expressway, covering approximately 3.8 acres.  The CUF is equipped with two rail car unloading platforms located under a large covered structure (Transfer Building). Only one rail car is connected at a time.  The Transfer Building is located approximately 100 feet west of the Main Office Building.  Empty and full chlorine trailers,  are stored in a paved storage area west of the Transfer Building.  In addition, a chlorine rail car may be occasionally located in an area, immediately east of the Transfer Building.  The evaporators and the chlorinators are located in the Control Building No. 3 adjacent to the Transfer Building . The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the CUF at any given time is more than the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It is also more than the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  \n\nChlorine leak sensors are provided in the Control Building No. 3 and chlorine vent boxes, located outside the building.  In addition, each rail car and chlorine trailer angle valve, which is connected during the unloading process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply from the rail car or chlorine trailer can be stopped by closing the shutoff system from any of the five control panels: at the unloading platform, at the east and west sides of the north wall of the Transfer Building, in Control Building No. 3, and in the Main Office center wall. \n\nThe chlorine sensors will trigger alarms on the Main Control Board (Mills Plant control room and the gas detector monitoring station).

In the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the Mills Plant control room. The CUF has an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the CUF in the event of a power failure.\n\nAccess to the CUF is controlled through a gate which is closed during non-working hours.  There is also a security guard on duty at CUF during non-working hours.  The chlorine storage area is marked Authorized Personnel Only.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes, due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nFor the worst-case as well as alternative release scenarios, the released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) which disperse in the atmosphere.  The distances to the toxic endpoints were estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.

No passive mitigation or administrative controls were considered for the worst-case release scenario.  The results of the dispersion analysis indicate that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider active mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no such chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Unloading Facility Plant boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis where a release would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \n\nThe alternative release scenario selected involves the release of chlorine from the monel flexible hose connecting the chlorine rail car to the chlorine trailer, which is being loaded. This scenario can occur if the operator uses a flex hose, which is worn or has a defect, resulting in a crack during withdrawal of liquid chlorine from the rail car. It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16-inch) diameter."

      "SummaryText": "If such a leak were to occur, the operators present would immediately see it or be warned by the chlorine monitors installed at the CUF.  It is assumed that approximately ten minutes would be required for the CUF operators, who are present at the facility during chlorine unloading operations to don personal protective equipment, evaluate the situation  and activate the remote controlled shutoff actuator and immediately close the valve at the chlorine rail car.  Chlorine flow from the rail car will stop in approximately 3 seconds after the activation of remote controlled shutoff actuator.  The activation of the shutoff actuator is considered as an active mitigation measure which will reduce the total quantity of chlorine released to the atmosphere during an accident.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of this scenario is highly unlikely because the flex hose is carefully inspected during each connection/disconnection operation, and during operator rounds.  In addition, under the CUF preventive maintenance schedule, the flex hoses are replaced at least every two years (more frequently than recommended by the manufacturer).\n\nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint distance was also estimated using the RMP*Comp (version 1.06) software.  Toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3 ppm.  EPA suggested typical meteorological conditions used were Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 meter per second, average air temperature of 77 deg F, and average relative humidity of 50 percent. The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the alternative release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nFinally, no chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the CUF during the last five years.  \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe CUF complies with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements"

The operating procedures include connection/disconnection from storage start-up and shutdown for chlorine evaporators, after maintenance start-up for chlorine evaporators, maintenance shutdown for chlorine evaporators, start-up and shutdown for ejectors, start-up and shutdown for chlorinators, chlorine system emergency shutdown, start-up following an emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  Also included are the maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to correct or avoid deviations. The CUF updates procedures whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Opera"

The CUF ensures that each employee newly assigned to the process, is trained and tested to be competent in the operating procedures listed pertaining to their duties.  The CUF training program includes four elements: (1) initial training and awareness training, (2) refresher training, (3) documentation, and (4) and testing.  Each employee presently involved in operating the unloading process has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine emergency response, as provided in the operating procedures.  \n\nRefresher training is provided every three years or less to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, the CUF ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their Management of Change procedures.\n\nThe CUF prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, provides certification of the records, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person (s) administering the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe CUF has procedures and policies in place that ensure that the contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work.  The contractors are informed, prior to the initiation of the work at the site, of the applicable provisions o"

The CUF holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area; controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor's performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nThe CUF ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new process covered by this regulation, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  The CUF maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The CUF mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\n7 Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and prior operating experience.\n7 Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\n7 Training of maintenance personnel in preventive maintenance program procedures; safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions; and safe use and application of special equipment and/or unique tools.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nThe CUF requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the covered process.  The CUF uses a permitting and training program to ensure hot work is monitored and conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine.\n\nThe CUF provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows CUF staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the propo"

The CUF will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe CUF investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the CUF chlorine system.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the CUF during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nThe CUF is a first responder facility (i.e. specially trained facility employees respond to chlorine accidental releases).  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Riverside County Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine release.  As p"

      "SummaryText": "art of the emergency response program, the CUF has developed and implemented a Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan (HMHWCP) for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The HMHWCP has a special focus on responding to chlorine emergencies.\n\nThe HMHWCP plan is being coordinated with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, HazMat responder team, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all HazMat responders. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine unloading process in 1992 and 1995 for chlorination system equipment and procedures, when a Risk and Hazard Analysis (following California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines) and a Process Safety Management Program were prepared for the CUF.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and are being implemented as required.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in November 1998, when the process hazard analysis was reviewed.  It is expected that these recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented by December 1999.\n\nAs part of this ongoing commitment to chlorine safety, MWDSC is evaluating the future transfer of chlorine trailer-filling operations currently taking place at the CUF to a vendor at another location who has installed a facility for containment and scrubbing of their chlorine trailer filling area (to collect and neutralize an accidental release)."
