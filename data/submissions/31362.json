THE CHLORINE STORAGE ROOM IS EQUIPPED WITH, CHLORINATORS, A LEAK DETECTOR WITH AUDIO AND VISUAL ALARMS,  VARIOUS SAFETY EQUIPMENT, ELECTRIC PANELS, AND INSTRUMENTATION.  THE  TREATMENT PLANT IS MANNED 24 HOURS A DAY BY CERTIFIED OPERATORS.\n\nACTIVE MITIGATION MEASURES WHICH ARE IN AFFECT INCLUDE:\n\n? CHLORINE LEAK DETECTION EQUIPMENT WITH AUDIO AND VISUAL ALARMS\n? VACUUM TYPE CHLORINATORS AND CHLORINE GAS PIPING \n? LEAK CONTAINMENT WITHIN THE CHLORINE STORAGE BUILDING\n? ABILITY TO PROVIDE NEGATIVE PRESSURE WITHIN THE CHLORINE STORAGE BUILDING\n \n\nTHE UTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS ACCIDENTAL CHLORINE RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING KEY ELEMENTS:\n\n? OPERATOR AND SUPERVISORY TRAINING\n? AN ONGOING PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\n? THE USE OF STATE OF THE ART PROCESS AND SAFETY EQUIPMENT\n? THE CREATION AND USE OF ACCURATE AND EFFICIENT OPERATING PROCEDURES, DEVELOPED AND WRITTEN WITH THE FULL PARTICIPATION OF THE OPERATORS AND ST"
