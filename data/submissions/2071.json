The facility engages its employees in ongoing training about their responsibilities in implementing compliance programs. The emergency response program is based upon Henkel's published policy statement that it will adhere to the codes of the Responsible Care) initiative developed by the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA). Henkel Corporation is a member of the CMA. \n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled \n\nThe Calhoun facility stores, blends and ships products containing inorganic acids. The products are used by industry for metal preparation, surface treatments, and the cleaning and treating of metal surfaces in the automobile, coil, general line and container industries as cleaners, conversion coaters and rinses.The facility stores hydrofluoric acid (70% aqueous) in a bulk tank.\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures \n\nThe facility's worst-case scenario is the release of the contents of the tank when filled to the maximum allowed under written administrative controls (45,000 lbs of acid; approxiimately 4,300 gallons). The release would occur into a diked containment area that would limit the areal spread of an evaporating pool. The USEPA rule does not allow us to consider the effect of our water deluge system when determining the distance to endpoint. According to USEPA \"Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (May 24, 1996)\" the distance to endpoint is 0.43 miles.\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe facility complies with the USEPA's accidental release prevention rule and with applicable state and local codes and regulations. The HF acid tank has been dewsigned, installed and maintained in compliance with ANSI standards and sta"

Facility personnel have been trained in accordance with safe handling procedures developed by Allied Signal, the supplier of hydrofluoric acid (70% aqueous) to the facility.\n\nHandling of the material by by the facility does not occur until after the delivery truck has backed up to the \nloading dock, the transfer hose has been attached by the delivery truck operators, and the load has been accepted by the facility. Delivery truck operators are trined by the supplier. Transfer and pumping operations (loading tank and later transferring to mixing vessels) are attended at all times by faiclity personnel and follow a written standard operating procedure (SOP).\n\nAddtionally, the immediate area contains perimeter monitors sensitive to HF vapor.\n\n\n5. Five-year accident history\n\nWe have not had an accident involving HF that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon Henkel Corporation guidelines consistent with Responsible Care( codes developed by the Chemical Manufacturers Association. In the event of an emergency involving the HF acid tank, it is our policy to notify the Calhoun Fire Depratment and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire deprtment; the Fire Marshall has inspected our tank.\n\n \n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe facility trains its personnel on a regular basis. Safety training is modified based upon revised federal, state and local rules and regulations. The safety of plant systems is upgraded continuously as new equipment is installed."
