The facility has one anhydrous ammonia tank and four urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) liquid fertilizer storage tanks.\n\nB.Accidental Release Record: \n\nThe Meredosia Terminal has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to facility personnel since it was constructed in 1964. \n\nThe facility safety record is direct result of continued emphasis on safety by management, employees, contractors, and truck drivers. There have not been any releases from the Terminal that meet the description of an RMP accidental release.\n\nIn case of a reportable chemical accident, information in the RMP will be updated within six (6) months of the date accident accrued.\n\nC.General Accidental Release Prevention Policies And Activities:\n\nThe entire Nitrogen team works together to ensure the facility complies with OSHA??A?S Process Safety Management standards and the accident prevention program are continuously improved. A networked computer management system is utilized to provide our employees with the necessary tools and records to maintain the safety of the process. This teamwork is an integral part in the safety efforts of the facility.\n\nAccident release prevention steps include the fourteen-element program for Process Safety Management, a management system, corporate oversight of the facility, and a focus on continuous improvement.  \n\nThe facility encourages all employees to participate in the facility??A?s safety program. Examples of employee participation include participation in Process Hazard Analysis, cooperative training, updating of operating procedures, and emergency response activities. \n\nThe facility has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pump compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner, conforms to generally accepted standards, and provides a basis for training. Inspections and test are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. \n\nF.Five Year Accident History: \n\nThe Meredosia Terminal has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel. In addition, the terminal has operated without a lost time accident for over twenty-eight years. There have not been any incidents that meet the definition of a RMP recordable release.\n\nG.Emergency Response: \n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plans covers accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency response practices and procedures, and process safety topics. The plan is reviewed at least annually with all employees. \nAll permanent employees have the required Hazmat training. Each employee and permanent contractor is trained on the facility's Emergency Response policies and procedures at regularly scheduled safety meetings. \nThe Terminal supervisor attends scheduled Community Advisory Panel meetings.
