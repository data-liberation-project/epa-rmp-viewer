Written procedures are developed\nas part of this program that specify the steps for every task undertaken related to the chlorine system. Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change. The RMP also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change. In addition to the RMP, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are strictly followed.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (July 2019 to July 2024) for the Metro Pool Chemicals facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMetro Pool Chemicals is taking additional steps to further public and personnel safety.
