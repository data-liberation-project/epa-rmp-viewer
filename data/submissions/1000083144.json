These are flammable gases, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and reduce health threats to our workers and the nearby community.  Aeropres Corporation will strictly adhere to all federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nSafety depends on:\n\n\n\na)    The manner in which we handle these products\n\nb)    The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility\n\nc)    Operating and maintenance procedures\n\nd)    Employee training\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program details employee responsibilities, actions, and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and the LEPC to notify potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to ship liquefied petroleum gases to our customers via truck and rail.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAeropres complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 and ASME codes and regulations.  All employees are trained on the characteristics and safe handling of the regulated substances at our site.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR 68.  The following sections"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What-if/Checklist and/or HAZOP study.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our process, Aeropres maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nAeropres has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the process as well as safe work practices and emergency response measures.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Aeropres facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried \n\nout by qualified personnel trained in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corr"

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new or modified processes are conducted as a regular practice at Aeropres.  The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\n\n\nThe Aeropres facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nAeropres promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nIt is our belief at Aeropres that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Our company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nOccasionally, Aeropres hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities.
