If an emergency were to occure, it is our policy to notify the Fenton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a farmer owed cooperative.  We sell agricultural products to memebers and non-members. We sell NH3 for the sole purpose of fertilization of farm ground.  This facility consists of one 30,000 gallon storage tank and 23 nurse tanks (12 - 1500 gallon and 11 - 1000 gallon). \n\nOur worst case scenario would be the sudden release of the main storage tank when it was filled to capacity.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to endpoint would be 4.4 miles with an approximate population of 456 people.  Since this facility is located within the city limits of Fenton, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons.  An evacutaion plan is in place.\n\nOur alternate scenerio would be the acidental pull-away by a recieving transport unit without disconnecting the transfer hose.  According to EPA look-up tables, the endpoint would be .5 miles with an approximate population of 300 people.  All employees working at this facility have been trained on how to respond to this type of scenerio.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage or evacuations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency at our NH3 plant, it is our policy to noticy the Fenton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and memeber of the fire department have inspected our NH3 facility.\n\nThere are no planned changes of our proceedures or policies."
