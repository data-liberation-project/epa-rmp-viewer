Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Pro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. in Delhi are strongly committed to employee,\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nIf such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and\nmitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Rayville Fire\nDepartment, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 14,884-gallon tank at our facility in Delhi (Figure 1).  The maximum amount\nstored is 12,651.4 gallons (65,104 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (65,104 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 3.8 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated pop"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 75.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that\ndescribes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all\nprocesses (Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nPro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. maintains written operating procedures to ensure that\nactivities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various\nmodes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators\ninvolved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nPro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure\nthat employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated\nwith these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. conducts documented maintenance checks on process\nequipment to ensure prop"

Examples of process equipment that would receive\nmaintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems,\nemergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the\nmaintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Pro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. to manage changes in\nprocess chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance\npersonnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions\nare promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to\nnew processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm\nthat construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup\nprior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to\ndetermine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented. \nAny non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPro-Boll Chemical and Fertilizer Co., Inc. truly believes that process safety management and\naccident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their\nviews concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
