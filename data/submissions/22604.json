The alternate release scenario would be a pigtail disconnecting from a cylinder. The release from this scenario would impact an area within 0.2 miles of the plant. The building which houses the chlorine cylinders and process equipment is secured at all times. The process equipment is constantly monitored by plant employees. It was installed in 1996 and is considered state of the art. \n\nNo modifications to the facility are planned in the near future. Personnel training, process and chemical awareness and monitoring will continue to be emphasized to minimize both the on and off site consequences of a chemical release."

This plan is also available to interested persons, including the public, demonstrating that this facility is complying with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Requirements, Risk Management Programs under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7). This regulation is published in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThere is one regulated substances at this facility, chlorine, that is above the threshold quantities specified in Section 68.130 of 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore this facility must comply with the risk management program. Chlorine is used to disinfect the treated effluent from the wastewater facility prior to discharge to the Appomattox River. There have been no releases of chlorine from this facility for the past five years. SCWWA has assessed and continues to assess hazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment. If after reading this program, you find that improvements can be made, please contact this organization.\n\nThe Program 3 eligibility criteria applies to facilities where: \n\n\u00b7 The facility is already covered under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. \n\u00b7 The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for this facility is 4952 \n\u00b7 The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this facility is 221. \n\nThe following elements have been completed as they apply to this facilities Program 3 operations: \n\n\u00b7 The single RMP, including registration that covers the chlorination  process and chlorine (40 CFR 68.12(d)). \n\u00b7 The management system as provided in 40 CFR 68.12(d)(1). \n\u00b7 The hazard assessment as provided in 40 CFR 68.12(d)(2).\n\u00b7 The Program 3 Prevention Program as provided in 40 CFR 68.12("
