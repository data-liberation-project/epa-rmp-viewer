If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. This is done on the behalf of our farmer owners who use this product as a fertilizer for crop production nutrients. The maximum quantity stored would be 114,000 pounds in or 26,000 gallon storage tank. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 114,000 pounds, which represets the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.32 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\nThe faciliity has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, published by ANSI.  Our firm is also regulated by EPA, DOT and we have an annual inspection of our facilities by The Kansas Department of Agriculture. All of these factors along with the training we have done have helped us achieve an excellent safety program.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the faciity, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has an e"
