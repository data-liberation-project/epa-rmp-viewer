Safety performance will be a key element of each employee's and contractor's performance evaluation.  Excellence in safety performance is a condition of employment at GEON.  The prevention of accidents while off the job is equally important. The same principles at work are also effective in preventing accidents in the home, on the highway and in all other activities.\n\nWorking and living safely must be our way of life. \nW.F. Patient\nChairman of the Board\nPresident & CEO\n\n \nSUMMARY OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe GEON Company, located in Avon Lake, Ohio, has one regulated flammable substance identified for the Accidental Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68.130) above the Threshold Quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds: Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (CAS No. 75-01-4).  \nNo toxic chemicals listed in the Accidental Release Prevention Program exceed the TQ. \n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative scenario(s), including administrative controls\nand mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario are outlined herein:\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nFailure of the tandem pair of storage tanks would release 210,000 pounds of VCM. It is assumed that the entire contents of the two adjoined tanks are released as a vapor which finds an ignition source. 10% of the release quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is 0.355 mile with the distance for radiant heat dose of 5 kW/square meter of 0.347 for the worst case scenario. \n\nUsing the equations for calculating over pressure from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAG).\n' The endpoint for VCM is 0.355 mile (1875 feet).\n\nUsing Fire Radiation Table 22, Page 68 of OCAG.\n' Endpoint for VCM is 0.347 miles (1832 feet).\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA failure of the hose connecti"

The entire contents of the tank car, 180,000 pounds of VCM are released in 3.5 hours. Unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit(LFL). \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the LFL for the alternative scenario is less than 317 feet.\n\nUsing Exhibit C-2, page 98 of OCAG. \n' LFL of VCM is 92 mg/l \n\nUsing Reference Table 21, Page 65 of OCAG.\n' Distance to LFL for 1,000 pound/minute release rate is <0.06 mile. (317 feet)\n \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Geon Company has in place a prevention program encompassing elements consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard(PSM) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals(29 CFR 1910.119) VCM, the same substance is regulated under the USEPA Clean Air Act( Section1 12(r)(7)Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs(RMP)( 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nThe GEON facility which is covered under the PSM and RMP standards has implemented the following:    \n\n1. An Employee Participation policy has been instituted to regularly consult with employees regarding the development and implementation of PSM/RMP elements and hazard assessments.\n \n2. A comprehensive Process Safety Information program which insures complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment. This information is included in the employee training programs. \n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n4. The preparation of Operating Procedures which describe tasks to be performed, operating conditions to be maintained, data to be recorded, and safety precautions to be taken. \n\n5. The GEON Company has established Employee Training programs to insure that all employees, including maintenance and contractor employees involved with chemical"

Elements include the following: \n\n' Identification and categorization of equipment and instrumentation \n' Inspections and tests\n' Establishment of prescribed inspection frequencies \n' Development and application of pertinent maintenance procedures \n' Training of maintenance personnel \n' Documentation of test and inspection results \n' Documentation of manufacturer's maintenance recommendations\n \n9. A \"Hot Work\" Permit system is in place to manage welding, cutting, brazing or spark producing operations in process areas.\n\n10. To properly manage changes involving processes, chemicals, technology, equipment or facilities a Management of Change system has been implemented.. \n\n11. In the event of any chemical release or \"near miss\" an Incident Investigation is conducted by a team of experienced individuals familiar with the process. Any recommendations are documented within the Management of Change system. \n\n12. An Emergency Response program is in place for the entire facility and the surrounding community in the event of a chemical release. \n\n13.
