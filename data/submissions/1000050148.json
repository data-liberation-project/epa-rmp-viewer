Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Refreshments Auburndale, Florida facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Polk County Fire Services and the Polk County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility primarily produces juice and fruit drink products.  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our three (3) closed-loop refrigeration system.  Here is a summary of our RMP activity since year 2003:\n\n\n\n?    Late 2003 - The original ammonia refrigeration system was installed at the facility, however, below the RMP reporting threshold.\n\n?    January 2006 - The system was upgraded and additional ammonia introduced into the system at a total quantity above the RMP \n\n        threshold, thus requiring the submittal of the original RMP (17,430 lbs).  \n\n?    June 2007 - The RMP was updated due to increased inventory (21,000 lbs).\n\n?    July 2009 - A third RMP was submitted due to increased inventory (35,200 lbs) and changes in plant personnel.\n\n?    May 2011 - A forth RMP is being submitted due to the addition of a second anhydrous ammonia system (System II) that contains \n\n        23,100 lbs"

April 2012 - This fifth RMP is being submitted due to the addition of a third anhydrous ammonia system (System III) that \n\n        contains 25,100 lbs of ammonia (Engineering Calculation) and a newly conducted PHA (02/14/12).\n\n?    March 2015 -The eSubmit Reporting web-based software was utilized to correct the Emergency Contact data. Additionally, the \n\n        Operating Procedures & Compliance Audit dates were updated. As a result of these data changes being a correction, a new \n\n        anniversary date was not generated and the validation warnings were removed.\n\n?    May 2015 - A sixth RMP was submitted due to the completion of a PHA as a result of the \"Phase IV Cooler Expansion\" project. \n\n        This included the addition of 3,000 lbs. of ammonia into loop #1 and 1600 lbs. into loop #2.\n\n\n\nAll three (3) systems operate independently, but for the sake of this RMP, all systems are considered a single process.\n\n\n\n The purpose of the refrigeration system(s) is to provide cold storage capabilities for perishable products.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management\n\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Refreshments facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chem"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, Coca-Cola Refreshments maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and pump out.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that authorized employees, who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system, are competent in all relevant operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments carries out highly documented maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

Authorized employees whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments conducts PSM/RMP audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The audit of the full PSM/RMP programs will be carried out at least every three (3) years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of these audits will be undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, an unintentional release of ammonia.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as to define any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring.
