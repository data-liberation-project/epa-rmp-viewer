      "SummaryText": "The Cannon Cold Storage was built in 1997 utilizing the most current state of the art ammonia refrigeration equipment and construction technics.  The system was designed, constructed and installed by one of the most respected names in commercial refrigeration, M&M Refrigeration of Fedrealsburg, MD. Construction of the system was subject to Federal, State and local regulations.\n\nPrior to opening, a Process Safety Management System was developed.  This included Process Hazard Analysis utilizing a \"what if\" study conducted by PrimaTech Inc of Columbus OH.  This study looked at all aspects of the refrigeration system including possible design or construction oversights, operational deficiencies, and safety issues.  This study produced six hardware type recommendations and fourteen procedural recommendations, all were addressed prior to start up. None of the recommendations were classified with a \"likelihood of occurring\" of being High or even Moderate in nature. \n\nThe refrigeration system is microprocessor controlled which is Y2K compliant.  This system in addition to controlling temperatures and pressures, includes monitored ammonia leak detectors throughout the facility which will both alarm locally and to a off site monitoring facility which notifies off site responders as necessary.  This system will automatically shut down and isolate the ammonia located in our high pressure receiver should a severe leak be detected, or operational parameters be found outside predetermed limits.\n\nA Risk Management Plan has been developed in the unlikely situation where an ammonia leak would reach outside our facility.  This plan has been reviewed with both the Bridgeville Fire Chief and the Sussex County Local Emergency Preparedness Coordinator.  This plan has calculated a \"worse-case\" release of ammonia to encompass a circle with a radius of 1.2 miles and could affect an esitmated 1,500 residents.  An alternative release scenario has also been generated with a calculated endpoint "
