The facility consists of a 18,000 gallon storage tank and associated piping, valves, and related appurtenances.  This report addresses the actions that would be taken in the event of an accidental release and related emergency response policies.  Two possible release scenarios are addressed.  In the first case, a mechanical failure releases the entire contents of the tank in ten minutes.  The second scenario is release of 95 pounds of ammonia in one minute caused by a transfer hose failure Response to either of these events is covered in our Emergency Action Plan.  No release incidents have been reported during the past five years.  We provide safety training for our employees annually, keep the local emergency response units informed, inspect our equipment and facilities on a regular basis to assure facility safety."
