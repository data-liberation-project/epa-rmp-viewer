The first tank provides high purity propane the bulk of which is used for heat, but it also supplies the propane to a process where it is used as a feedstock for a carburizing process.  The next three tanks are interconnected and provide standard grade propane which is used only as a fuel.  Each tank is individually equipped with pressure relief valves and excess flow valves. Due to reduced production levels two of the three interconnected tanks are currently empty but still usable at any time.

The 254 acre facility is located half way between Hartford CT and Springfield MA. The site is secured by 6-foot high fencing and a 24-hour security staff which restricts public access.\n\nHamilton Sundstrand is an aerospace company which includes the design and manufacture of air, spacecraft and marine control systems and components. Products include environmental control systems, fuel control systems, propeller assemblies, electronic components, electrochemical cells and testing equipment. Wastewaters from these processes are treated by an on-site wastewater treatment facility. HS has received excellence awards from UTC and Connecticut Business & Industry Associations for Environmental, Health & Safety (EH&S) management and continuous improvement. HS has also received registrations under ISO 9000 Quality Management Systems and ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems. The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection presented HS with a Green Circle Award for achieving ISO 14001 registration.\n\nAn EH&S Oversight Organization representing all HS operating and functional units provides strategic direction for the EH&S initiatives. EH&S professionals have been assigned to provide technical support to each operating center within HS to ensure day to day compliance with EH&S regulations. In addition, the managers of each operating unit within HS are held accountable for compliance with EH&S regulations. A Safety Culture Grass Roots Team was established to ensure that safety was a first priority in day to day activities. \n\nAny new chemical or new/modified process proposed for the site must first be approved by the EH&S Department. All containers of virgin chemicals are labeled with the manufacture's label.  If the chemicals are transferred to a secondary container, a hazard communication label indicating the hazards and proper personal protective equipment to we"

Chemical Handling, Hazard Communication, and Waste Management training are provided throughout the year for new and existing employees.\n \nThe regulated substance requiring HS to have a RMP is propane. There are four 18,000-gallon propane tanks situated in the same area. The first tank contains high purity propane which not only supplies fuel to be used for heating, but also as a feedstock for a carburizing process and therefore falls under the RMP regulation.  The next three tanks are interconnected and provide standard grade propane which is used only as a fuel for equipment such as heaters and powered industrial trucks. Currently two of the three tanks are empty but may be utilized at anytime depending on production levels.  Subsequently, both release scenarios were calculated using worst case situations involving all four tanks assumed as full. No active or passive mitigation measures were included in the scenario. This enables HS to project a true worst case in order to better understand the ramifications on the facility, the public, and the environment. \n\nThe worst case release scenario mandated by the EPA is a vapor cloud explosion and was calculated using EPS's RMP* Comp software. The endpoint used was 1 pound per square inch, per EPA's guidance. This resulted in an on-site impact distance to endpoint of 0.50 miles. The conservatively estimated residential population is 25. Public receptors include the residences and the lower portion of an airport terminal. A recreational park located on HS's site was included as a receptor even though the park is infrequently utilized by the public. There are no environmental receptors. The alternative release scenario is tank overfilling resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and was calculated using EPA's OCA Guidance. The distance to endpoint is 0.20 miles. There are no public or environmental receptors.\n\nT"

Each tank is individually equipped with pressure relief valves and excess flow valves. A backflow check valve is supplied on the loading station as well as an emergency shutoff valve. An alarm system and a deluge system are provided which signal the on-site Emergency Services Department if an emergency has occurred. All loading and unloading operations are performed under the supervision of qualified HS associates. The tank system is located in an area not frequently traveled which greatly minimizes the chance of an ignition source such as a passing vehicle, and all equipment is properly grounded.\n\nThere was one incident in the past five years due to the failure of a regulatory and pressure relief valve.  The release was immediately contained following established emergency procedures which were deemed effective during the incident response reviews. HS has an Integrated Contingency Plan which describes actions to be taken in the event of a spill, fire or medical emergency. The facility has an on-site Emergency Services (ES) Department with a full time fire/security staff supplemented by a volunteer fire brigade. 300,000 gallons of fire stand pipes feed the fire pumps with makeup coming from the Metropolitan District Commission potable water system. The ES Department manages the upkeep and maintenance of the fire systems. In the event of an emergency the highest ranking ES personnel at the time of the incident acts as the Incident Commander.\n\nArrangements with outside agencies include the Windsor Locks fire department, Windsor Locks police department, local environmental contractors, and local hospitals. In the event an outside agency is called for assistance, upon arrival the town fire department will act as the incident commander and notify the public for action to be taken.
