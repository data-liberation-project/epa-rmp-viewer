Included in the construction of this facilty were excess flow valves in all openings to and from the storage tank.  Also incorporated in the plumbing was a manual bypass at the riser, and an automatic bypass at the pump which is plumbed directly back into the storage tank to prevent excess pressure in the system.  Also included at the facility is all the necessary safety equipment to operate a safe facilty, and equipment to be used in the case of an emergency, all of which is a requirement of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.\n \n   Tri-Ag Distributors Inc. Anhydrous Ammonia facility is located approxiamenty 1 mile south of Omega, Il on the Omega road.  The bulk storage tank has a capacity of 30000 liquid gallons and is positioned 346 feet west of the Omega Road and is 465 feet from the nearest private residence.  The maximum amount of product stored at the facility at any given time may be 47000 gallons of Anhydrous Ammonia split between the bulk storage tank and the liguid nurse tanks.\n \n  Under the worst case senerio, we derived the endpoints using the DEGADIS Model.  At 200 ppm it is 2.5 miles to the thresehold for rural population for a total loss of 140000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  In the alternative case release, a pipe leak would give ua a thresehold of 1.14 miles rural and .59 miles urban, assuming the release was stopped within 2 minutes.\n \n   Tri-Ag Distributors Inc. constructed the Anhydrous Ammonia facility according to the rules of the Illinois Department of Agriculture by providing the necessary safety equipment and setbacks to adhere to the laws of Part 215, Anhydrous Ammonia, Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Equipment.  We have also included a daily log which contains inspections of nurse tanks, storage tank and application equipment, as well "
