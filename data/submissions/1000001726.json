This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  This facility, commissioned in August 1988, was designed and constructed utilizing generally accepted industry codes and recommended practices such as ANSI \u00c2\u00bf American National Standard Institute, ASME \u00c2\u00bf American Society of Mechanical Engineers, TEMA - Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association, and API \u00c2\u00bf American Petroleum Institute.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plans have been developed to control and contain such a release.\n\t\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\t\nThe Willard CO2 Separation Plant is located in a rural area four (4) miles North of Denver City, Texas.  Denver City has a 2000 census population of approximately 3900.  Denver City is located in West Texas approximately 90 miles South of Lubbock, Texas and 90 miles North of Midland, Texas.  The plant processes a wet (H20) carbon dioxide rich (83% CO2) gas stream to produce a dry CO2 rich (86% CO2) natural gas stream for use in tertiary oil recovery projects in the immediate area.  Natural gas liquids (NGLs), sulfur, and hydrocarbon condensate oil are also produced from this process.  The plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.  The Willard CO2 Separation Plant\u00c2\u00bfs current capacity is 90 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).  Current plant throughput averages 90 MMSCFD of raw gas from various West Texas tertiary oil recovery projects. \n\nThe CO2 rich/wet gas stream is compressed, dried, and"

The compressors and the other rotating equipment are electrically driven except for the emergency electrical generator and firewater pump, which are diesel engine powered.  The natural gas fired equipment includes: boilers, glycol re-boiler, gas heaters, plant flare and other combustion sources which burn sweet natural gas purchased from outside sources. \n\nAfter the first and second stages of compression, the entire feed gas stream goes through a triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydration system to remove water from the gas stream.  Lean TEG absorbs the water and small amounts of hydrocarbon from the gas stream.  The rich TEG flows to a flash tank, where the hydrocarbon gases are released and returned to the plant inlet for re-processing.  From the flash tank, the TEG is regenerated using a direct-fired re-boiler.  The water vapor and hydrocarbon separated from the glycol are condensed.  The oil and water are subsequently separated from each other.  The oil is sold and the water is used for injection in a nearby tertiary oil recovery project.In 2006, a fuel gas recovery unit was installed just downstream of the Ryan-Holmes process, to recover fuel gas from the CO2-rich residue gas.  This unit produces fuel gas for internal use and for outside sales, increasing Willard Plant efficiency, and producing a more desirable residue gas for reuse in tertiary oil recovery.  The cryogenic process uses a compressor and CO2 fractionation column to process about 60 MMSCFD of residue gas, producing about 8.7 MMSCFD of low-BTU fuel gas.  As part of this project, a molecular sieve unit was installed to enhance water removal capabilities from the Ryan-Holmes feed gas.\n\nAfter the gas is dehydrated it enters the Ryan-Holmes process, a patented lean oil absorption gas separation process, that separates the CO2, nitrogen, and methane from the H2S and NGLs.  The system includes a closed loop pr"

The 86% CO2, rich residue gas leaving the Ryan-Holmes process is compressed to higher pressures.  The majority of this gas is mixed approximately 50/50 with third party pipeline CO2 for use in nearby tertiary oil recovery fields.  The remainder, though not mixed, is also used in a nearby tertiary oil recovery field.\n\nThe CO2/H2S sour NGLs from the Ryan-Holmes process are sweetened with a diethanolamine (DEA) system.  Lean DEA removes hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and the remaining CO2 from the NGLs.  The now rich DEA is regenerated in the amine re-concentrator by adding heat (via steam) to drive off the CO2 and H2S.  The CO2 and H2S from the re-concentrator are routed to the sulfur recovery unit (SRU).  The sweetened NGLs extracted from the DEA process are stored in pressurized tanks, then pumped and sold through a third party pipeline. \n\nIn the SRU, H2S is converted into elemental sulfur.  This molten sulfur is stored in a vessel until it is shipped out in insulated trailers and sold.  The waste gas from the SRU is then incinerated.  Supplemental gas is added to the incinerator to ensure complete combustion of the waste gas stream.\n\nAuxiliary equipment includes three (3) steam boilers, three (3) redundant instrument air compressors, one backup electrical generator powered by a diesel engine, electrical and diesel driven fire water pumps, fire monitors throughout the plant and a 30,000 BBL fresh water storage tank for process usage and fire fighting.  \n\nAn open and closed drain system collects miscellaneous plant fluids into API separators.  Plant waste oil from rotating equipment and gas liquids from compressor scrubbers are skimmed from the water and pumped into the slop oil tank.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when such measures are deemed necessary.   We are following up with the HAZOP analysis in 2004"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\t\n\tTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will continue at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\t\n\tOperating Procedures\n\t\n\tThe Willard CO2 Separation Plant maintains written process procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) Startup after turnaround, (3) normal operations, (4) normal shutdown, (5) emergency shutdown, (6) emergency operations, (7) temporary operations, (8) operating limits, (9) consequences of deviation, (10) safety systems and their funcitons, (11) safety and health considertions, (12) description, and (13) one line diagram.

      "SummaryText": "the Willard CO2 Separation Plant has implemented training programs for all employees involved in operating a process (KBC). New operators receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  Operators must demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own before they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\t\n\tContractors\n\t\n\tThe Willard CO2 Separation Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force, especially during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\t\n\tMechanical Integrity\n\t\n\tThe Willard CO2 Separation Plant uses generally accepted industry recommended practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown (ESD) systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting on-site and off-site training (both company and vendor based) (2) contracting of third party companies for specific tasks, e.g. ultrasonic thickness (UT) testing, pressure safety vessel (PSV) testing, and API 510 vessel inspection, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\t\n\tMaintenance and operating personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.
