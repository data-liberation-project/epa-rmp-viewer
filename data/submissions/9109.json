The owner, management, and employees of Southwest Chemical & Fertilizer, Pipestone, Mn. are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia or Propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION.\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane for sale to farmers and other customers.\nB. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application on crops as a fertilizer nutrient.\nC. Propane is received, stored, and distributed as LP-Gas to the end user.\nD. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 79000 pounds in a 18000 gallon storage tank, which represents 85% of the tank capacity, as limited by design standards.\nE. The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 100000 pounds in a 30000 gallon storage tank.\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 79000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would be .83 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario is based on a release from a break in a transfer hose. The quantity released would be 26000 pounds. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would be .59 miles.\n\nIV. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S FOR PROPANE.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank. The maximum q"

The alternative release scenario, is based on a discharge line break while pumping. The maximum quantity released would be 5200 pounds. The distance to endpoint (1-psi) would be .10 miles.\n\nV. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\nA. The facility has implemented the provisions of the safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane published by the American National Standards Institute Inc.\nB. The facility has implemented the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29-CFR 1910.111 and 29-CFR 1910.1200 storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane.\n\nVI. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, or propane that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor have resulted in off site deaths, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nVII. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nA. The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29-CFR 1910.38.\nB. The facility has provided to the state and local authorities, the emergency planning and community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nC. The facility has a written Emergency Response Program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29-CFR 1910.120 including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nVIII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\nA. Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions and evaluate employee training. There are no specific anhydrous ammonia or propane safety recomendations at this time."
