      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThe Fox Metro Water Reclamation District (FMWRD) is dedicated to the transport and treatment of wastewater in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment.  Protecting the health and safety of FMWRD employees as well as the general public during wastewater treatment activities is the primary objective.  FMWRD prides itself in its excellent operating record.  The facility was first constructed in 1929.  In the last 30 years, no accidents have occurred which would put the public or the environment at risk.\n\nThe FMWRD developed a safety committee which is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the safety rules and procedures.  The committee is made up of management and labor representatives, which acts as a resource for FMWRD.  The safety committee is responsible for accident and injury records, development and implementation of the safety and education program, safety inspections and safety standard compliance.\n\nFMWRD treats approximately 32 million gallons of wastewater on a daily basis.  The general process for treating wastewater utilizes physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove pollutants.  First, bar screens and grit chambers remove large debris while primary settling basins permit smaller particulates to settle out from the influent flow stream.  The flow is subsequently mixed with activated sludge (bacteria) which remove organic pollutants through the bacterial metabolism.  The bacteria are then allowed to deposit into secondary settling tanks.  Finally, the flow is passed through sand filters, disinfected, and discharged into the Fox River at levels below the compliance standards registered at the IEPA.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was created to address methane, a flammable gas which is created through the anaerobic digestion process.  Anaerobic digesters are large tanks where bacterial activities are utilized to decompose organic solids from wastewater.  These organic solids are called s"

      "SummaryText": "ludge.  The process of anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge eliminates pathogenic organisms, reduces the amount of materials that require ultimate disposal, creates a sludge which can be easily dried and utilized for farmland enhancement, and creates gases that can be used as a fuel supply.\n\nAccording to FMWRD's 2009 operating data, the gas created from the anaerobic digestion process contains on average 62% methane, 35% carbon dioxide, 1.5% nitrogen, and 1.5% water.  This gas is collected from the digesters and stored in a sphere for storage and for later use, and the excess gas is burned off by on-site, permitted flares.  \n\nThree digesters (M3, M4, and M5) are in service and M1 is currently undergoing maintenance through June 2010.  Upon completion of the M1 maintenance (TPAD project), M2 will go back online and M4 will be utilized for storage.\n\nThe digesters with the associated piping produce approximately 6,545 pounds of digester gas per day and the capacity of the sphere is approximately 6,545 pounds of digester gas.  Therefore, the total maximum amount of digester gas present on site in one day is 13,500 pounds.\n\nRMP* Comp, a software modeling program created by the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Cameo team of the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division was utilized to determine the worst-case release scenario should a release occur of all of the methane at the site.  The modeling program was utilized to develop a theoretical vapor cloud explosion upon immediate release of all 13,500 pounds of digester gas.  Failure of all of the gas containing equipment at once could potentially produce a vapor cloud explosion scenario within a 0.20 mile radius.  Total failure of all of the gas containing equipment at once is an unlikely scenario.  Failure of only one digester or only the gas sphere would cause a vapor cloud explosion scenar"

      "SummaryText": "io within a 0.10 mile radius.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\nThe Release Prevention Program consists mainly of employee health and safety training, preventative maintenance, and strict operating procedures.  Employees are trained immediately upon employment and updated annually thereafter on proper welding and cutting procedures, lock out/tag out procedures, proper lifting, hand safety, fork lift operation, hazard communication, fire extinguisher training, and first aid/CPR.   Preventative maintenance prevents breakdowns, reduces wear, improves efficiency, and extends the life of equipment and structures while enhancing the reliability and dependability of the wastewater treatment equipment.  Strict operating procedures ensure that the proper start up/shut down sequences are utilized when operating equipment.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nFMWRD has had no accidental releases of methane in the past five years.  No one either on-site or off-site had been injured in association with the methane, and no emergency evacuations have resulted.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\nAn emergency response program is in place at FMWRD in the case that an emergency were to occur.  The employee(s) first aware of the emergency would notify the emergency response center who in turn would immediately notify the appropriate emergency responders (Oswego Fire Department and Kendall County Sheriff's Department).  Select employees at the facility have been assigned duties in the event of an emergency and are trained to fulfill those duties and assist professional emergency responders."
