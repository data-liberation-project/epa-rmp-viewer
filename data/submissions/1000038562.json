The employees receive periodic refresher training and participate in annual emergency response exercises.\n\n\n\nDeltech Resin Company manufactures synthetic resins at the facility.  The regulated substances under the federal Accidental Release Prevention (APR) rule are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) (unspecified isomer CAS # 26471-62-5) and vinyl acetate monomer (108-05-4).  TDI is used for manufacturing urethanes.  Vinyl acetate is one of the monomer used in acrylic manufacturing.  The acrylic manufacturing is regulated as \"reactive hazards\" under the New Jersey Toxic catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the federal APR rule, the facility is regulated under the New Jersey TCPA and Discharge Prevention Containment and Countermeasures (DPCC) and Discharge Cleanup and Removal (DCR) programs. \n\n\n\nSome of the prevention measures implemented at the facility to minimize accidental release of the regulated substances and consequences of a release include:\n\n\n\nStorage tanks and unloading areas are provided with secondary containment.\n\nStorage tanks are equipped with high level alarms.\n\nStorage tanks are provided with normal and emergency vents.\n\nProcess area is equipped with sprinkler system.\n\nAcrylic polymerization reactors are provided with rupture discs.  They discharge to a foam over tank in case of rupture of the disc.\n\n\n\nThe risk management plan of the facility includes standard operating procedures, preventive maintenance program, and training of the employees.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan to respond to any emergency at the facility.  The employees receive annual refresher training in emergency response and participate in annual emergency response exercise. \n\nThe facility has not had any accidental release in the past five years.\n\n"
