Morrill Water Treatment Plant (MWTP) is subject to the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program for chlorine which is an EPA regulated substance.  Chlorine is used to disinfect water before it is delivered to the City of Beeville. The facility treats an average flow of 3.5 million gallons per day (MGD) of treated water and has the capacity to store 12,000 pounds (lbs.) of chlorine. The chlorine at the facility are contained in two 1-ton containers that are on a standby/on-line basis to ensure the chlorination process is continuous. Chlorine is drawn from the 1-ton containers in a gaseous state.\n\n\n\nThe City of Beeville has contracted day to day operations and maintenance to INFRAMARK.
