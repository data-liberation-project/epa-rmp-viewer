      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Non-essential personnel will be evacuated to more remote locations outside the main refinery.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, butane, pentane, propane, and flammable mixtures.  In addition, the refinery uses aqueous ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance.  Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated; hydrogen sulfide, anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and mercaptans do not exceed their respective threshold quantities and therefore are not reported.\r\n\r\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\r\n\r\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes.  The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery, and is designed to remove salt and sediment from raw crude oil then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products.  The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator tower and the vacuum tower.  Negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum) is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.  The Crude Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.  The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 74,000 pounds (lbs). \r\n\r\n#1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit\r\n\r\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Unit c"

The purpose of the #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit is to convert the low-octane gasoline feed fractions from the Naphtha HDS and Hydrocracker units into a stabilized high-octane blending stock.  This is accomplished through the use of catalyst under high temperatures and a hydrogen atmosphere.  The Naphtha HDS Unit is designed to treat the feedstock for the #1 Reformer.  Treatment is necessary to prevent contamination and plugging of the Reformer catalyst.  The #1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.  The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 51,000 lbs. \r\n\r\nCoker\r\n\r\nThe Coker is a thermal cracking unit designed to receive and process vacuum residuum from the Crude Unit, which is separated into a sweet dry gas, debutanized or depropanized gasoline, coker stove oil, light coker gas oil, heavy coker gas oil, and coke.  The Coker is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.  The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 33,000 lbs. \r\n\r\nHydrocracker\r\n\r\nThe Hydrocracker is a combined hydrogenation and catalytic cracking process designed to convert low-grade gas oils to high-quality gasoline and middle distillate products with a net consumption of hydrogen.  The Hydrocracker is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.  The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 116,000 lbs.  The anhydrous ammonia inventory was reduced to less than 10,000 lbs in late 2011 and no longer exceeds the threshold. \r\n\r\nLight Ends Unit\r\n\r\nThe Light Ends Unit #16 is designed to process feed streams containing C5s and lighter hydrocarbons (pentane C5, butane C4, propane C3, ethane C2, and methane C1) and to produce pentane, isobutane, normal butane, and mixed butane for storage and handling.  It also produces fuel gas, Hydrogen Plant feed, or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) feed for Unit #22.  The Light Ends Unit is Pr"

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA re-validations.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team forwards its findings to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all program EPA-RMP covered processes at the refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.

For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes, to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) performed at Cherry Point will be via either hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) or What-If Checklist studies.

The simulators are fully functional and can duplicate all unit characteristics, and can also be used to simulate proposed changes to determine whether safety parameters could be violated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow the site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they encounter during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEWS\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery conducts a process startup safety review for any new facility or facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the safety review is to ensure that safety feature"

Examples of these practices include: (1) electronic control of unit entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (4) a permit and procedure to control hot work activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage process changes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls will not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training for the change.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nThe refinery promptly and thoroughly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or persona"

The frequency of accidental releases has been extremely low. The refinery has not had any release that has gone outside of the refinery boundaries. There have not been any OSHA recordable injuries resulting from a flammable release or a toxic release in the past five years. Every incident is investigated carefully and changes are instituted to prevent such an incident from happening again.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has implemented an emergency response program (ERP) to prepare for potential incidents, respond to them effectively, and recover from their impacts.  The goal of the program is to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and ac"

Employees receive training in these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific emergency response duties. \r\n\r\nThe ERP includes a set of potential incidents that are used for emergency drills, including accidental release of toxic gases (ammonia), accidental release of flammable materials resulting in a fire and explosion, and accidental spill of hazardous materials on the ground within the refinery perimeter.  \r\n\r\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery uses an Emergency Management Organization, known as the Incident Command System (ICS), to respond to and manage incidents.  The ICS has a hierarchical (i.e., chain-of-command) structure that places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.  The Emergency Manger is a liaison between the Incident Commander, the public, and the Company.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position within the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, defined in the ERP.  The ICS is expanded or contracted to meet the needs or requirements of an emergency; as the scope and complexity of an emergency expands, so does the ICS.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the BP Cherry Point Refinery is coordinated with the Whatcom County Local Emer"

The design basis provides for a future case where the unit can process cracked feedstocks under more severe conditions, although numerous modifications still need to be made to accomplish this.  As currently designed, the unit processes straight-run diesel feeds from the crude unit.  The ULSD process combines hydrogen with straight-run diesel feeds and processes them in a high-pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst.  The reaction produces hydrogen sulfide, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing.  The amine hydrogen sulfide mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur.  The unit consumes 6 to 7 million standard cubic feet per day of 220 pounds per square inch gauge hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 parts per million (ppm) to less than 15 ppm.
