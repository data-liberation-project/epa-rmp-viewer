      "SummaryText": "Introduction\r\n\r\nCalpine Corporation's South Point Energy Center uses anhydrous ammonia as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides (or NOx) to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of anhydrous ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  As the company responsible for operating South Point Energy Center, Calpine Corporation take its safety obligations in storing and using anhydrous ammonia as seriously as they take controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps taken every day to ensure a safe operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe South Point Energy Center accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of Arizona and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\n\r\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  This document summarizes existing health and safety programs, internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia to the environment.  South Point Energy Center has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe South Point Energy Center is located at 3779 Courtwright Road, Mohave Valley, Arizona, in Mohave County.  The power plant is located on a 320-acre property on the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation on"

      "SummaryText": "the lower western slopes of the Black Mountains.  Havasu National Wildlife Refuge and the Topock Marsh lie approximately 1.2 miles south of the facility.  South Point Energy Center is a natural gas fired 544 megawatt combined cycle power plant.  Electricity generated by this facility is transported by lines owned by the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).  Power is delivered from the plant to the Topock substation off-site by two 230 kV transmission lines in order to wheel power to the WAPA distribution grid.  The electricity is sold under a variety of short-, mid-, and long-term contracts into the Arizona, California, and Nevada markets.\r\n\r\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP regulations, in two 14,193 gallon (filled to 85% capacity) steel bulk, pressurized storage tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the South Point Energy Center to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) created during the combustion of natural gas and subsequently exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tanks and diluted with air, and injected into the two Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce NOx emissions.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at South Point Energy Center exceeds the federal RMP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP regulations.\r\nRelief Valves.  Pressure relief valves are located throughout the process system to protect against excess pressure.  All process related factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the safety of workers and the integrity of the equipment piping from the overpressure.  The storage tanks are equipped with excess-flow check valves to stop the flow from the bulk tank in the event of an emergency.  \r\n\r\nSecondary Containment.

Two Chillgard RT leak detectors are provided for the system to perform ambient ammonia monitoring.  These monitors provide a signal to the Control Room to manually activate the deluge systems when high levels of ammonia are detected.  These sensors are located north and south of the secondary containment unit and set to alarm when an ammonia concentration of 200 ppm  is detected in the air.\r\n\r\nAlarm System.  The ammonia process is checked during every 12-hour shift as part of the routine Operator rounds at the South Point Energy Center. The storage tanks are provided with local pressure indicator (in psig) and level indicators (in percent volume).  The tanks are also equipped with pressure safety valves, temperature gauges, and ammonia leak detectors.  Tank level, temperature, and pressure indication are displayed locally and indication and alarms are displayed on the Control Room Distributed Control System (DCS).  \r\n\r\nEmergency Shower and Eyewash. An emergency eyewash and shower are provided at the truck unloading station near the ammonia storage tanks. \r\n\r\nDeluge System.  A deluge water system, consisting of one spray monitor attached to a fire hydrant located west of the containment area, is provided to dissipate an ammonia vapor cloud in case of a leak.  The system will be manually activated in the event of an ammonia leakage.\r\n\r\nSolenoid Shut-Off Valve.  On each ammonia storage tank there is a solenoid shut-off valve. This is an electronically operated ball valve that is controlled by the DCS system to initiate valve closure in the event of a leak detected in the process piping.\r\n  \r\nSite Security.

The results can be found in the  in the Compliance Workbook.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: A realistic alternative release scenario was defined for the process.  The results can be found in the Compliance Workbook.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks; Calpine has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\r\n - There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\r\n - The system undergoes scheduled, routine maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\r\n - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE"

The Team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and the plant engineers, as well as an experience PHA facilitator.  The PHA technique used was a What-If/Checklist Analyis and Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) method, two of EPA's recommended approaches.  The PHA was facilitated by a chemical engineer knowledgeable in the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a 5-year period or whenever there is a major change in the process (prompted by a Management of Change [MOC]).  A list of actions to resolve any significant findings from the PHA was prepared, and the South Point Energy Center staff are currently working to resolve this action item list.  Staff will document completion of any and all action items.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nSouth Point Energy Center maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the ammonia process.

Oral reviews and written self-evaluations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed. \r\nTraining documentation includes:  date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understands the training.  Ongoing employee training records are maintained.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe South Point Energy Center has procedures and policies in place that ensure that only contractors with good safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the ammonia process.  Contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work.  The South Point Energy Center sets minimum contractor saf"

South Point Energy Center maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The South Point Energy Center believes that this program is the primary line of defense against a release.  Maintenance staff address equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training of these procedures.  Our mechanical integrity program includes the following:\r\n - Visual inspections twice per day of ammonia tanks, lines, and equipment\r\n - Training of maintenance and operations personnel in safe work practices such as lockout-tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions\r\n - Procedures specifying training requirements for contract maintenance employees, as well as requiring contractors to use plant-developed maintenance procedures for process areas.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \r\n\r\nSouth Point Energy Center requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the regulated processes.  South Point Energy Center uses a comprehensive permitting and training program to ensure hot work is conducted safely.  \r\nSouth Point Energy Center provides a system and approach to maintain and implement management of changes or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows employe"

South Point Energy Center assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the regulatory process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nSouth Point Energy Center investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment, so that similar accidents can be prevented.  South Point Energy Center trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of any incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by appropriate staff and is added to, or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  Information from audits and any resulting changes in operating procedures are passed onto the training unit for their inclusion in existing training programs, if warranted, to prevent a future event.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nEPA RMP regulations require reporting the five-year accident history of the covered processes.  The details of accidental releases are required for accidents that have caused at least one of the following:\r\n - Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\r\n -"

This program has been coordinated (reviewed) by the Mohave Valley Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency action and notification plan.  Emergency operation and action procedures are also reviewed once per year.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nDuring the PHA, several additional risk reduction measures were recommended to improve safety at South Point Energy Center.  All PHA recommendations are being considered for implementation.  The South Point Energy Center reviews operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure applicability.  This continuous review process is intended to generate further recommendations for improved safety during the course of the operating life of the anhydrous ammonia system."
