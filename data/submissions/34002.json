Gilead, North Carolina,  Montgomery County Water Treatment Plant under contractual agreements with the County of Montgomery, North Carolina, the owner.\n1.1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (a) The American Water Montgomery County, North Carolina Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP)  40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (A) (1)  American Water  has a management system in place which oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other American Water  policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n1.1.2.  PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)  American Water  maintains policies, procedures and systems as prt of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3 - listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plants' OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in AmericanAnglian's Process Information Document Management System (DMS) document contron system.\n1.2. AMERICAN WATER STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY, NC SITE (b) The American Water Plant employs 10 full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the potable water treatment process.\n1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1) The site is owned by Montgomery County and operated by American Water.  The site is located at 724 Hydro Road, Mt. Gilead, Montgomery County, North Carolina.  The 15 acre site is boarded by Lilly Bridge Road on the east, and Hydro Road on the south.

The boundaries of the chlorine system subject ot the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and control rooms and the associated vent make up an exhaust system.\n1.2.2. REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b) (2) Chlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The American Water  chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to two process control systems.  Chlorine is an EPA and OSHA listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3. WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS ? Two offisite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenrios.  The first is a \"worst case release\".  The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the 1/4 shall assume that the 1/4 maximum quantity in the largest vessel 1/4 is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur thatn the worst-case scenario\".  \nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\".  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/1 equals 3 ppm.  The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA)  as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for u"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n1.3.1.  WORST CASE ? (1) Atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions.  Results demonstrate a distance of 1.30 miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affectged by the release is estimated at 122 people.\n1.3.2. ALTERNATIVE CASE ? (2) The alternative release scenario involved the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one ton-containers.  This faiulre is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the EPA waste water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 20.0 lb./min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is 0.20 miles.  The number of public receptor that would be impacted by this release is zero.\n1.4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d) The American Water  accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall site program.  The second is the chlorine-spcific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Mt. Gilead, North Carolina fire department.\n1.4.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d) (1) Facility-wide, many elemetns of the prevention program are used for all operations.  The overviews of these generally written programs are listed below:\n. American Water  has detailed process safety information"
