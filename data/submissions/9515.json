      "SummaryText": "In 1970, Ganes Chemicals bought a 146 acre site in Pennsville, NJ and in 1973 began producing active ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry.  These ingredients are used in a variety of prescription and over-the-counter drugs used for blood pressure control, weight reduction, decongestant, anti-depressant, anti-nausea and HIV treatment.  Over the years, the facility has expanded steadily and now includes three manufacturing buildings, two warehouses, offices, labs, a maintenance shop, a waste treatment facility, and a state-of-the-art milling and blending facility.  This year a new dryer facility will come on line.  For the near future, we plan another $30 million in projects to upgrade the faciliy's environmental, production and quality control systems.  The Pennsville site currently employs 140 people.\n\nGanes has always been committed to operating its facility in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  Over the years, we have continuously improved our safety and environmental programs and in the mid 1980s these programs were further enhanced by our compliance with the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) and later with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard.  One of the additions to the program was the establishment of an Emergency Response Team made up of trained Ganes employees.  When the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came out with the requirement to establish a Risk Management Program (RMP) by June 1999, we only had to make some minor adjustments in our in our existing programs.  One of the adjustments was with regard to communications between Ganes and the local and county emergency response groups.  We are updating our respective emergency plans and are discussing how to improve notification to the community should an emergency occur.\n\nLast year, Ganes opened its doors to the neighbors and residents who came and familiarized themselves with the facility.\n\nThe only chemica"

      "SummaryText": "l currently subject to the Risk Management Program is Phosgene, which is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  It is used to make Bethanechol Chloride, which is a compound of the prescription medication Urecholine.  This medication is used in the treatment of urinary retention.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\nThe worst case scenario is a catastrophic failure of cylinder of phosgene resulting in the loss of the entire contents (120 pounds) within 10 minutes (per EPA definition).  Using the OCA guidance, the distance of the plume to its end point is 3.8 miles.\n\nPhosgene cylinders are covered by the Compressed Gas Association and Department of Transportation specifications.  The cylinders are tested far in excess of their normal working pressures.  Each container is stamped with a serial number, hydrostatic test date and water capacity.  All containers are thoroughly checked for leaks and abnormalities prior to shipment by both the supplier and Ganes.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario:\nThe alternative release scenario is a 1/16\" leak from the cylinder stem.  Using the OCA guidance, approximately 0.2 pounds of phosgene are released per min for 60 min.  The distance of the plume to its end point is 0.31 miles.  The detection area monitors would detect a leak at a low concentration, and set off an alarm activating the Emergency Response Team.  The trained Emergency Response Team would quickly mitigate the release and control the leaking cylinder.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention:\nThe facility is inspected annually by New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection annually to verify compliance with the following New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe (TCPA) requirements:\n\n7 Process Safety Information: includes the process design and safe operational limits information.\n7 Process Hazard Analysis: to identify and address potential safety hazards.\n7 Risk Assessment: to estimate and reduce the likelihood and impact of potential accident scenarios, to i"

The plant has a trained Emergency Response Team.  Monthly training sessions ensure that all members meet annual training requirements.
