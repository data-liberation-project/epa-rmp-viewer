The flammable mixtures typically contain various regulated substances such as but not limited to hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. There are no regulated toxic substances present above a threshold quantity in any process. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n \nFlammable Worst Case Scenario \nThe Western Refinery Yorktown, Inc. has performed worst case scenario ryvCS) analyses as required by the rule, and has shared this information with local emergency responders as well as the surrounding communities. \nFlammable Alternative Release Scenario \nThe alternative release scenario for the refinery is a rupture of a loading hose while loading a butane railcar. Under this scenario, the release is isolated within 5 minutes. The maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint is .24 miles which reaches off-site. This scenario is based on industry history and is a practical scenario for emergency response planning. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n \nFollowing is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Western Refinery Yorktown, Inc. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\n \nEmployee Participation\n \nThe Yorktown refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented"

In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Examples of such teams at the refinery include the Joint Union/Management Health and Safety Committee, the Refinery Process Safety Committee, and the Safety Audit Team.\n \nProcess Safety Information\n \nThe refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Asset divisions within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the process safety overview information for each process to help employees and visitors quickly locate any necessary process safety information.\n \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within \nthese limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available."

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \nThe refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained. \nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected.chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. The system ensures that required training and documentation updates are completed prior to the commissioning of the change. \n\nIncident Investigation \n\nThe refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire or explosion, toxic release, property damage, environmental incident, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwa"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n \nCompliance Audits\n \nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and management personnel participate in audits. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n \nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nThe processes at the refinery have potential hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP?covered processes. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n \nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the refinery has safety features on many processes to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes: \n\nRelease Detection\n \n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms \n2. Video came"

We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The refinery has not had any incidents covered by the RMP rule in the past five years.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nThe Yorktown refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address "

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. Personnel are trained on or informed of all changes to the refinery emergency response program that affect them.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the refinery is coordinated with the York County Department of Fire and Life Safety. This coordination includes periodic meetings with York County emergency response officials. The refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate York County and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic meetings, the refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the York County Department of Fire and Life Safety, and the refinery provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \nThe Yorktown refinery resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. The following types of changes are planned:\n \n?Revisions to personnel training programs  \n?Revised written operating procedures \n?New instrumentation and alarms for enhanced process monitoring \n?
