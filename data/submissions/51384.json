This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our refinery adheres to federal and state regulations, industry standards and practices, internal process safety policies and guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on years of company and industry experience. Examples of specific resource material are: the American Petroleum Institute Standards and Recommended Practices, the National Board Inspection Code, the Giant Process Safety Booklets, the Giant Process Safety Standards and Guideline Manual, the Giant Refining Business Group Implementation Guidelines for OSHA 1910.119, the Giant Recommended Good Practices Manuals, the Giant Corporate Engineering Specifications, and the Yorktown Refinery Fire and Safety Manual. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Yorktown refinery is located at 2201 Goodwin Neck Road, Yorktown, VA, 23692. The refinery is owned by Giant Industries, Inc. The refinery processes approximately 62 thousand barrels of crude oil per day \nin a variety of processes to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, #2 burner fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), etc. The refinery has 10 processes that contain materials above the threshold quantity and are, therefore, covered by the RMP rule. Of these processes, 2 qualify for Program 1 coverage and 8 qualify for Program 3 coverage. All covered processes "

The flammable mixtures typically contain various regulated substances such as but not limited to hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. There are no regulated toxic substances present above a threshold quantity in any process. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n \nFlammable Worst Case Scenario \nThe Western Refinery Yorktown, Inc. has performed worst case scenario ryvCS) analyses as required by the rule, and has shared this information with local emergency responders as well as the surrounding communities. \nFlammable Alternative Release Scenario \nThe alternative release scenario for the refinery is a rupture of a loading hose while loading a butane railcar. Under this scenario, the release is isolated within 5 minutes. The maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint is .24 miles which reaches off-site. This scenario is based on industry history and is a practical scenario for emergency response planning. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n \nFollowing is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Western Refinery Yorktown, Inc. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\n \nEmployee Participation\n \nThe Yorktown refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented"

      "SummaryText": " in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Examples of such teams at the refinery include the Joint Union/Management Health and Safety Committee, the Refinery Process Safety Committee, and the Safety Audit Team.\n \nProcess Safety Information\n \nThe refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Asset divisions within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the process safety overview information for each process to help employees and visitors quickly locate any necessary process safety information.\n \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within \nthese limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available."

      "SummaryText": "\n \nThe refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \nThe refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained. \nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted "

Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration and their final resolution is documented and retained.\n \nOperating Procedures \n\nThe refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process (when necessary). These procedures are developed by experienced operators or supervisors and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them in accordance with the management of change process. \nIn addition, the refinery maintains Safe Operating Limit Tables that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining \n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.
