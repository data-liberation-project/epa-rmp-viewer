      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\tOverview\nThe Liverpool Wastewater Treatment Plant is a 15 million gallon per day facility that removes pollutants from municipal sewage prior to discharging the clean water to the West Branch of the Rocky River. As a last step in the treatment of the wastewater, chlorine is added to kill any remaining bacteria. The chlorine used in this process is purchased in one-ton cylinders. Typically, eleven (11) cylinders are stored in a chlorination building specifically designed for this purpose. Three (3) of the cylinders are in use and connected to the chlorination system while eight (8) are waiting to be used. All cylinders are contained in a concrete block building with a pre-cast concrete roof to minimize any possibility of fire in the building. Fire alarms have been installed and have been connected to the plant-wide computer system. The cylinders are stored on appropriate saddles on a concrete floor. No other materials are stored in the building. A windsock has been installed on top of the building to determine the wind direction. A chlorine leak detection alarm and chlorine detector levels are displayed on a plant wide computer system. The system is maintained and checked on a routine basis in accordance with the plant internal preventative maintenance program.  \n\n\n\tChlorine Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Administration at the Liverpool Wastewater Treatment Plant; in conjunction with plant operators, chlorine supplier, and The Valley City Fire Department have developed standard operating procedures (SOP\u0092s) for the handling of the chlorination facilities. These procedures outline in detail how cylinders are connected to the chlorine feed system, the number of personnel (including observers) to be involved in the changing of the cylinders, the frequency at which chlorine piping and valves are to be replaced, etc. All operators are trained to know the SOP\u0092s and this training is reviewed yearly and during yearly safety meetings"

      "SummaryText": ". This training is evaluated by using written exams and individual audits. This document and all information are accessible on a plant wide web site that can be obtained by all personnel on any given day. All procedures have been continually revised by using the Process Hazard Analysis Procedures.  \n\nThe Liverpool Wastewater Treatment Plant Administration along with the Medina County Sanitary Engineers Safety Coordinator and County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), have developed a spill response document known as the Chlorine Spill Investigative/Response Procedure. This document provides step-by-step instruction regarding steps to be taken when responding to a chlorine leak. In 2006, 2011 and 2017 an internal worst case scenario SOP was created in conjunction with The Valley City Fire Department to train emergency response and plant personnel. Due to COVID a training response exercise has not been performed since 2017 with the fire department, we will be coordinating with the Valley City Fire Department to conduct an exercise in the near future. The Valley City Fire Department tries to schedule a meeting with plant management once a year to do a plant walk-through, this ensures the new volunteer fire fighters know the plant layout in case of an emergency. This last walk-through occurred June 5th 2023. \n\tWorst Case/Alternate Release Scenario\nAs part of this plan, a worst case and a more likely alternative release scenario has been documented. The worst-case release scenario calls for the release of the entire content of one cylinder in ten minutes. The cylinders are constructed of one-inch thick steel with recessed fill/discharge valves making the possibility of the loss of the entire contents of one tank within this time period remote. The alternative release is considered to be a more likely scenario of how a release would occur. In this scenario we have considered that a pipe has broken, or a valve has failed leaving a one square inch hole from which th"

The plant alarm has sounded but it has taken 10 minutes for the fire department to don their SCBA and HAZMAT suit and enter the building and secure the leak.\n\nModeling for the worst scenario was conducted using the RMP*Comp software. This scenario assumed a wind speed of 3.4 mph and a temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit during a loss of the entire contents of a full tank (2000lbs). This program indicated the estimated distance to Toxic Endpoint is 1.3 miles. The estimated toxic endpoint concentration is 0.0087 mg/l. The zone of influence used for the worst-case scenario was a 1.3 mile radius of the treatment plant.\n\nModeling for the alternative release scenario was also conducted using the RMP*Comp software. This scenario assumes a wind speed of 6.7 mph and a temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit during a loss of the entire contents of a full tank (2000lbs). The variables that we entered into the RMP* Comp program included a one square inch hole, a tank pressure of 130 psi, and the tank temperature was 92 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the most recent highest recorded temperature for our area. This program indicated the estimated distance to Toxic Endpoint is 0.3 miles. The estimated toxic endpoint concentration is 0.0087 mg/l. The zone of influence used for the alternative case scenario was a 0.3 mile radius of the treatment plant.\n\nMARPLOT was used to map the affected area surrounding the treatment plant. On the map the population effected within the 1.3 and 0.3 mile radius was added; the population was from the 2010 US census data. It was determined that the alternate release affected a population of 10 in the 0.3 mile radius and the worst case affected a population of 545 in the 1.3 mile radius.\n\nThe modeling was reevaluated using the RMP*Comp Software and MARPLOT in 2024, since 2019 no changes were found in the data. \n\n\n\tFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no chlorine related accidents or incidents reported in the last five years at"

Written procedures are readily available to plant operators on the plant wide computer system that include this document and our complete chlorine RMP program. Included are all of our SOP training, preventative maintenance, PowerPoint documentation, and reference information history. Steps to be taken during a release, entities to be contacted and the telephone numbers for those entities are also\ncontained in this document. Personnel at the plant are given training regarding the response procedures and refreshers are completed periodically during the plant safety meetings.\n\nIn April 9, 2007, Oct 24, 2011, and June 24, 2017 the local fire department conducted a mock emergency training exercise involving plant personnel at the wastewater treatment plant. The mock emergency was designed to simulate a major chlorine leak scenario. Special attention was given to our major leak SOP. We followed the steps outlined and made necessary modifications. These efforts along with safety operating procedures already in place will minimize the possibility for leaks and minimize response times in the event a leak does occur. This will result in a safe working environment and the protection of the local community.\n\nThe local fire department did a plant walk through On June 5th, 2023, to familiarize themselves with the plant layout and hazards. Another mock emergency response will be planned soon. \n\n\n\tProcess Hazard Analysis\nOn September 6, 2006 we had a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) meeting where we identified that the changing of the cylinders produced the greatest potential hazard of a release of chlorine gas. Four separate hazards were identified by the team.\n\nStarting on October 17th 2012 we held one PHA meeting including all the personnel for each shift. We used a checklist"

There were a few items that needed addressed and were completed by July 19th 2024. \n\n\tHoist Maintenance\nWe have had annual inspections on the chlorine cylinder hoist, which was completed by All Ohio Crane Inc. on March 3rd 2014. This inspection produced several improvement suggestions that we are currently implementing. We have also modified our preventative maintenance program and created a hoist maintenance SOP to improve on our regular hoist maintenance. The inspection results and the regular hoist maintenance documentation are maintained on our web site for the operators to review.\n\nApril 12, 2109 Tri-State Tool Hoist company inspected the chlorine cylinder hoist.
