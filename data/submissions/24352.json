Facility Policy\n\n                 The owners, management and employees of Country Spring Farmers Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Bellevue fire department or other local and federal authorities, to mitigate any release and the minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n                  The primary activity in the spring at the Franks branch is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n                 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n                The maximum quantity stored would be 200,000 pounds in two tanks size 30,000 and 18,000 gallon. The maximum quantity handle would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and alternative release.\n\n                a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity release would be 123,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point ofdispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.11 miles.\n\n                b. The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .56 mile.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n                The facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. Five year accident history.\n\n             a. There has been no accidental releas"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n           Safety is an on-going process at Country Spring Farmers Co-op. Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
