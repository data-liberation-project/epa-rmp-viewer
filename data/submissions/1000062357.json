      "SummaryText": "VanDeMark Chemical Inc. produces phosgene and phosgene derivatives. The facility is an RMP facility due to the presence and quantity of two regulated substances; phosgene and chlorine, and the predictive presence and quantity of methyl chloroformate. Phosgene is produced in the B-5 building and utilizes the railcar location at the north line of the property. Phosgene derivatives are produced in the D-area buildings towards the west of the facility. The entire facility is considered one unit, and rests on approximately 10 acres.\n\nVanDeMark Chemical Inc. is committed to Responsible Care, and has environmental, health and safety programs in place to meet those requirements, as well as compliance with OSHA PSM regulations and requirements.\n\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety programs include Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Process Safety Management program; including subtopics and procedures for process safety information, employee involvement, process hazard analysis, prestart-up safety review, management of change (PMR), inclusion of SOPs and P&IDs, employee training, contractor supervision, mechanical integrity program, hot work program and permitting, incident investigation, lockout/tagout program, confined space entry program, and an environmental monitoring program. These programs demonstrate an effort to minimize or eliminate potential impacts or releases and provides for responding to emergencies if they occur.\n\nEnvironmental monitoring includes numerous stationary detection devices used to identify chemical releases and to generate alarms for immediate response and action by both VanDeMark employees (internal) and by local emergency response departments (by community siren and phone/radio communication), as well as neighboring facilities. In addition, there are numerous hand-held detectors ready and available for use by plant personnel to detect releases and identify the location for immediate isolation from continued release. Based on RAGAGEP and Title V Air Perm"

The last RMP reportable accidental release was a chlorine release in 1998.\n\nVanDeMark's ERP contains detailed information for emergency response and communication with outside agencies. Contents included in the ERP are descriptions of roles and responsibilities based on the NIMS (ICS) systems, flow chart for emergency support structure, step-by-step instructions and setpoint indications for actions based on phosgene release quantities, an overall hazmat response plan, on-site hazmat response team with trained employees, plant wide power loss and emergency backup equipment, response to fires, response to first aid incidents, emergency notification process and contact phone numbers, shelter in place instructions, emergency evacuation procedures, and community siren. As part of the ERP, drills are conducted at least twice each year, and a third drill with coordination with outside agencies; the community siren is tested monthly for operation and volume, headcount drills are conducted for shelter in place drill, and emergency evacuation drills are also conducted. Facility layout drawings are included in the ERP, along with locations of fire hydrants, emergency showers, and eyewash stations.\n\nIn the upcoming months, VanDeMark will be conducting its annual offsite training for all employees which includes job specific environmental, health and safety training, and general training pertaining to the hazards of the facility, environmental, health and safety programs applicable to all employees (general awareness type), and hands on training for some aspects of emergency response. Additionally, there are 3 planned training events for chemical release response training and coordination, including one with outside"

Additional system improvement projects are also in the design phase in efforts to reduce unit emissions based on air permit requirements and to improve the company's \"green\" sustainability efforts. VanDeMark continues to interact with the local community through the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and leads the local community advisory panel (CAP) with planned events annually.\n\nSummary of recent improvement expenditures:\n\n2010-2011 - invested over $60,000 in emergency upgrades including backup power enhancements and alternate power sources for the scrubber system. Establishment of a secondary and mobile location for emergency response equipment.\n\n2012 - invested $25,000 in security upgrades based on internal audit findings.\n\n2016-2017 - investing $25,000 in redundant scrubber capacity in the event back-up power systems should fail.\n\nA third party PSM/RMP audit was also conducted by AcuTech in February of 2016 with all action items being worked to completion, with an intended completion of all actions by July 1, 2017.\n\n"
