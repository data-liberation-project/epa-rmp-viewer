Keyes Road to the north, Pike Road on the east, and E. Taylor on the south.  The entrance lies approximately 2-? miles east of S. Carpenter Road and about 3.2 miles directly northeast of State Highway.  The small town of Keyes is located east of the facility along Highway 99.  The area is largely agricultural with a few residences in the area.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains approximately 380 full time employees on site.  The plant operates three (3) shifts five (5) days a week throughout the year, except during the grape harvest season, when operation extends to seven (7) days a week and additional employees are hired for the season.  \n\n\n\nThe plant is comprised of offices, production and laboratory buildings, loading docks, warehouses, parking, tank farms, and wastewater ponds.  The facility is fenced along the entire perimeter and there is a security guard shack at the entrance.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Evacuation Assembly Areas are located as required for potential evacuations.  Employees are trained and drill for alarm responses and evacuations annually.\n\n\n\nProcess Description - Ammonia Refrigeration\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the heat transfer fluid.  The ammonia refrigeration process is a closed-loop, single-stage, mechanical refrigeration system, with little or no need for operator involvement.  The system is automatically controlled by a programmable logic controller, which minimizes the potential for human error.\n\n\n\nFacility maintenance mechanics regularly monitor process parameters, including pressure, temperatu"

A qualified ammonia refrigeration company provides service, design, and most regular preventive maintenance for the system.\n\n\n\nMost of the equipment is located outside, except for two chiller packages, which are located in the Mezzanine above the Barrel Room.  Jacketed wine tanks, chillers, compressors, condensers, and receivers are located throughout the site.\n\n\n\nSystem components are connected with steel piping approved for ammonia refrigeration service and the system includes numerous safety devices, detection systems, alarms, and control valves.  Physical protective measures and emergency shower and eyewash stations are located as required to improve safety.  Oil pots are provided at various pressure vessels for periodically draining accumulated refrigerant oil safely.\n\n\n\nPiping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) provide a graphical description of the system.  Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) describe the modes of operation, safety and health considerations, operating limits, and the safety systems and their functions.  The ammonia refrigeration system is audited regularly for mechanical integrity and complies with industry standards and the applicable codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Bronco Wine Company is used for controlling fermentation, chilling wine (referred to as \"cold stabilization\") and chilling grape juice.  The system is also used to produce cold glycol which is used for temperature controlled warehouse storage.  The system contains approximately 275,000 lbs. of ammonia.\n\n\n\nJuice and wine are stored in tanks.

The compressors provide high-temperature, high-pressure vapor as ammonia vapor is compressed.  Next, the evaporative condensers remove the heat of compression generated when the ammonia vapor is compressed.\n\n\n\nThe result of evaporative condensing is a high-pressure liquid, which drains to the receiver and is made available for cooling via control valves to other parts of the system.  As cooling is required in chillers or wine tank jackets, the liquid is metered and pumped from the suction accumulators.  As the liquid ammonia passes through the cooling coils or chillers, it absorbs heat from the wine and subsequently expands and vaporizes as the pressure of the ammonia drops.\n\n\n\nThe resulting liquid/vapor mixture is returned from the chillers to the accumulators, where the liquid and vapor are separated to protect the compressors from liquid slugging.  Ammonia vapor is returned to the compressors to repeat the cycle and accumulated liquid ammonia at the bottom of the vessel supplies the pumps.  \n\n\n\nEmergency switches are located in the Compressor Areas for emergency shutdown.  \n\n\n\nThe Primary System Components include:\n\n\n\nEQUIPMENT    QUANTITY\n\nReciprocating Compressors w/ separate oil separators    2\n\nScrew Compressors w/ integral oil separators    7\n\nEvaporative Condensers    11\n\nHigh-Pressure Receivers    6\n\nSuction Accumulators    6\n\nLiquid Transfer Units    5\n\nChillers (Shell & Tube Heat Exchangers)    48\n\nAmmonia Pumps    7\n\nOil Pots    3\n\nJacketed Wine Tanks    18\n\n\n\n \n\nProcess Description - Sulfur Dioxide Process\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide gas is added to wines and juices to prevent unwanted microbial activity.

The portable cylinders are transported to the point of use for injection into fruit juice, pulp and/or skins to inhibit unwanted microbial activity.\n\n\n\nNo chemical reactions or special process temperatures need to be maintained.  The process involves the simple transfer from a larger vessel to a smaller one.  Plant nitrogen is connected and opened to the vapor valve of the one-ton cylinder to assist in the transfer of liquid sulfur dioxide.  The amount (pounds) loaded into the canister is monitored by the operator observing the liquid level sight glass on the canister.\n\n\n\nThe operation is conducted outdoors.  A bleed line is available during portable tank filling.  A second bleed line is also available to purge residual sulfur dioxide within the transfer lines before hoses are disconnected.  These bleed lines are connected to a scrubber system which is continuously fed water.  Since sulfur dioxide is soluble in the water (forming sulfurous acid), no emissions are produced.  Clean water passes through the scrubber continuously, thus, the water discharged to drain doesn't become over saturated with sulfur dioxide and a highly corrosive acid is not produced.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide from a one-ton cylinder is injected into the must line containing juice to inhibit fermentation.  The feed rate is controlled by a mass flow meter and metering pump.  Sulfur dioxide is soluble in water and juice, so no emissions are produced.  The quantity of sulfur dioxide added is determined by the wine maker.  The metering pump is interlocked with the must pump such that sulfur dioxide is only added when the must pump is on.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide gas is also used to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria in full and empty barrels in the Barrel Room.  Sulfur dioxide is injected from a 6 lb. dispenser into the head space of barrels before and after they are filled with wine for aging.\n\n \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PR"
