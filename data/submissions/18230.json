In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any;  release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviornment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 49313 \"establishments primarily engaged in farm or farming  operating however we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area; This product is subject to the EPS Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. Our facilities used for this product will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and late fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored only, with little if any product transfer taking place. The maximum quantity stored has been listed earlier in the RMP and will not be disclosed in this summary. The maximum quantity handled at a given time will be  the unloading of a rail tank car or a semi-trailer tank.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as need\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery. Annual hours for these needs to not meet the 2080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero. Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected day or night during use, and through out the \"off season.\".\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our larges"

The maximum quantity released has been identified earlier in this program and would effect some residential population. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nWe have not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site we believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose. Transfer hoses are protected by manual, self closing excess flow, and \"pull away\" valves Our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used for unloading the transporting tanks.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\nOur accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\" and  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Additionally, we will conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, breakaway couplers at risers, Emergency shut-off-valves, Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended. We l maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participate in safety training exercises on anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nFIVE - YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nWe have not had a release of Anhydrous Ammonia, within the past five years that has caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility. To our knowledge, we have not caused any offside deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM;\n\nThis facility is inclded in the written Community Emergency Response Plan as prepared by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), a"

Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee. We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia training programs by the local fire department(s), local emergency response team, community planners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going porcess at all of our facilities. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.
