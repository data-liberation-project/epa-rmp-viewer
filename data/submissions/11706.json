The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Twin-State Engineering and Chemical Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the reacting of ammonia with phosphoric acid to make intermediate ammoniated phosphate solutions that are upgraded to mixed-grade fertilizers.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 140,196 pounds in the facility's one 30,000-gallon storage tank filled to 85% capacity.\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank.  This was calculated by multiplying the water capacity of the storage tank by 4.6732, which represents the pounds of ammonia per gallon of water tank capacity.  The distance to the dispersion endpoint based on the DEGADIS Model is 2.68 miles.\nThe Alternative-Case Release Scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2\" transfer hose, with 11,908 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 1.2 miles.\n4. The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations are administered by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture "

      "SummaryText": "consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n5. The Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  To our knowledge, there have been no accidental releases that have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n6. The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written action plan in accordance with OSHA standard CFR 1910.38 and provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and committee right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n"
