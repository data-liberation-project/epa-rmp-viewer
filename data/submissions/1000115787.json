      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nTRV West is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  The facility has also developed a robust maintenance / mechanical integrity program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe TRV West facility is located at 5852 W Turner Rd in Lodi, CA.  There are 120 full time equivalent (FTE) employees at the facility. FTE was calculated considering 90 full time employees and 90 part-time/seasonal employees that only work 3 months of the year. Section 1.11 of the Risk Management Plan RMP*eSubmit User's Manual was referenced for this calculation.\n\nAmmonia is used in the facility\u0092s refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage of wine product.  The system uses a maximum of 85,000 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:    \n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the two high pressure receivers (HPR1 and HPR2).  The liquid can be pumped back and forth between the two receivers as needed.  Liquid is transferred from both receivers to two recirculators (RP1 and RP2) and the wine chillers.  Liquid ammonia from HPR1 is also used for liquid injection for oil cooling in the compressors.  \n\nAssociated with RP1 is a liquid trans"

Compressor discharge is used to pressurize the LTU and facilitate the transfer of liquid.   \n\nRecirculated liquid from RP-1 is pumped to a set of wine tanks (T357-T380, T520, and T521), which return recirculated suction to the same vessel.  RP-2 pumps recirculated liquid to the remaining wine tanks (T426-T443); suction generated at these tanks is returned to RP-2.  \n\nPrior to entering the wine chillers, the high pressure liquid ammonia (supplied by HPR 1 and HPR2) passes through a hand expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid.  The liquid is then fed to the shell side of the chillers and is vaporized as it absorbs heat from wine product flowing through the tubes.  The ammonia vapor is drawn off to either RP-1 (for wine chillers WC1-WC10) or RP-2 (for wine chillers WC11-WC18).\n\nThe pressure/temperature of the recirculators is maintained by the compressors, which draw suction from the vessels.  The pressure and temperature of the low pressure vapor is then increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained to HPR 1.\n\nCompressor discharge/hot gas is also routed to Wine Chillers WC4 and WC11, which are designed to either cool or heat wine product, depending on temperature demand.  When in heating mode, hot gas enters the chillers and is condensed to a liquid as it heats wine product flowing through the chiller tubes.  Using pumps associated with the chillers, the condensed liquid is transferred from the chillers to HPR1.    \n \nThe process also has an ammonia diffusion panel which is used only in an emergency situation to equalize the pressures between the low side and the high side, or to manually diffuse the system pressure to the facility\u0092s water sump.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTRV has developed an acc"

The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\u0095\tProcess safety information that details the hazards of ammonia, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment in the refrigeration system;\n\u0095\tWritten procedures for operating and maintaining the process;\n\u0095\tTraining for employees involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\u0095\tWritten management of change and pre-startup safety procedures for safely introducing modifications to the process;\n\u0095\tInvestigating the causes of releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence; \n\u0095\tWritten procedures for conducting hot work on or near the covered process;\n\u0095\tContractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises;\n\u0095\tAudit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance with the regulations; and\n\u0095\tEmployee involvement in program development and implementation. \n\nIn addition, the refrigeration system has several engineering controls to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  Examples of these controls include: \n\u0095\tEquipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  \n\u0095\tRelief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  \n\u0095\tThe Engine Room is equipped with ammonia detectors to warn personnel of a leak, and a ventilation system to provide continuous and emergency ventilation.  \n\u0095\tEmergency stop switches for the process are in place to allow personnel to stop flow of ammonia or shut down the system in case of adverse conditions.  \n\nRegular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nA review of the facility\u0092s five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility t"

In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nTRV has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, the procedures within the EAP will be implemented.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis (completed in March 2024) resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations can be found in the PHA report. TRV is moving forward with completing the recommendations.  In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, continued implementation and upkeep of the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."
