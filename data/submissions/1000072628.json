It is an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources from an integrated perspective. Companies such as Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC play a vital role in the global oil and gas industry as it is at the forefront of technology deployment, operational efficiencies, and infrastructure development.  Oasis Midstream Partners (OMP) is the subsidiary of Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC and serves as a fundamental business and operating unit that takes natural gas and crude oil retrieved in the upstream sector to the downstream processing facilities.  Thus, supporting activities that take place after the initial production phase and through to the point of sale. \n\n\n\nOMP, currently, operates the Wild Basin Gas Processing and Crude Handling Facility (commonly titled the Wild Basin Plant) in McKenzie County, North Dakota.  The Wild Basin Plant's purpose is to gather and process natural gas and crude oil produced from the Wild Basin area of the Bakken Shale Formation. The facility's location is approximately 5.5 miles north-northeast of Watford City in McKenzie County, North Dakota.\n\n\n\nThe Wild Basin Plant is required to develop and implement a proper Risk Management Program (RMP) to mitigate risk under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation for Chemical Accident Release Prevention (40 CFR 68).  This Program 1 Level requirement was fulfilled with the onset of the listed chemicals (as identified onsite) above their individual threshold quantities during the inception phase of the facility. Due to an increase inventory and facility expansions, this facility is subject to the RMP regulation at a Program 3 Level process and required an update.
