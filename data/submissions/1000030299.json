The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff as directed.  The Risk Management Program includes an Accident Prevention Program that consists of Chemical Inventory, Management System, Offsite Consequence Analysis, Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance Procedures, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation.  \n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by railcar or tanker truck.  If by railcar, the railcar is temporarily staged on the Facilities rail spur so that trained Facility personnel can transfer the anhydrous ammonia to the onsite stationary storage tanks (Covered Process 2).  Up to seven (7) 34,000-gallon railcars could be staged on the Facility rail spur, although the Facility does not store more than 5 railcars on the rail spur.  If by tanker truck, only one 9,500-gallon tanker truck is located on the property and the tanker truck operator conducts the transfer from the tanker truck to the onsite stationary storage tank.  From the storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to nurse tanks for retail sell to the customer.  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia to nurse tanks is discussed under Covered Process 2 (Storage and Handling).\n\n\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the RMPr while the railcar(s) is parked on the Facility rail spur, at the time of transfer, when the transfer process is complete, and prior to releasing the railcar back to the owner.  \n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) New Carlisle, IN Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the New Carlisle Facility located at 54300 Walnut Road, New Carlisle, IN 46552.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the New Carlisle Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the New Carlisle Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nIn 2012, Helena acquired this Facility and submitted this 5-Year update to reflect the new ownership. All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility were reviewed and/or updated. The updates are\n\nreflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nIn 2015, the Emergency contact and RMP Implementation Manager changed. This current update is being submitted to reflect the current contact.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe New Carlisle Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates two (2) covered processes that include Railcar Storage and Storage and Handling (stationary storage tank) of anhydrous ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "rous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a railcar (34,000 gallons) or commercial tanker truck (9,500 gallon) and then transferred to the single (1) 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  If by Railcar, trained Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia.  If by commercial truck, the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tank and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates (1) 18 1,450-gallon nurse tanks and (2) 33 1,000-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for two covered processes that are conducted at this Facility.  The two covered processes include anhydrous ammonia Railcar Storage and Storage and Handling.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility was the same for both covered processes and assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released over a 10-minute period.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 34,000-gallon railcar that is delivered in the winter months.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was different for each covered process.  The alternative scenario for the Railcar Storage assumes a 60-minute release from a Railcar vapor valve that was not completely closed.  The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 60 second release from a ruptured 3-inch transfer line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line du"

      "SummaryText": "ring a major loading or unloading operation.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes the Chemical Inventory, Offsite Consequence Analysis, Management System, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena's New Carlisle Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the New Carlisle Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the New Carlisle Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the New Carlisle Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the St. Joseph County LEPC and New Carlisle, Olive-Hudson Fire Department.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the New Carlisle Facility.\n\n"
