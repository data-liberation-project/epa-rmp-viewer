      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention policy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington Aqueduct, is to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances through the use of proper equipment and procedures.  All equipment that is used on the chlorination system at the McMillan Water Treatment Plant is consistent with design criteria. All procedures for operating and maintaining equipment-handling chlorine are written and are constantly reviewed and revised as needed.  In addition, all personnel operating or maintaining chlorine-handling equipment are provided a high level of training.\n\nChlorine storage and feed areas are in an enclosed building which contains multiple chlorine sensors.  In the event of a leak, these chlorine sensors provide an alarm to indicate to the operators that chlorine gas is at an elevated level in the building atmosphere.  In addition, several of the sensors are designed to activate the chlorine scrubber system in the event chlorine concentrations within the building exceed their setpoints.  The scrubber system is capable of scrubbing at least one ton of chlorine.\n\nIn the event that a substantial chlorine leak was to occur, specific McMillan Water Treatment Plant personnel are trained and equipped to respond.  Personnel are trained to use personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), in order to address emergency situations in a safe manner.  In the event that a more serious leak was to occur than McMillan personnel are able to address, local emergency responders would be contacted.  The Risk Management Plan is coordinated with local Hazmat personnel, in advance, as required by the Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nThe McMillan WTP is located in Washington, D.C. at 2500 First Street, N.W., and Michigan Avenue, N.W., adjacent to the McMillan Reservoir.  The plant rated capacity is 110 million gallons per day (MGD) and the average annual production of potable water is approximately 70 MGD.  At the McM"

      "SummaryText": "illan Water Treatment Plant, the Risk Management Program regulations are applicable to chlorine stored on site.  \n\nThe McMillan Water Treatment Plant is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  An electronic gate opener monitors and controls access to the plant, which is surrounded by a security fence.  A security guard is stationed at the front gate to admit visitors and deliveries on a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week schedule.\n\nThe general Washington Aqueduct accidental release prevention program for the McMillan water treatment plant includes the following key elements:\n\nA?    Comprehensive training of operations and maintenance personnel\nA?    Computerized preventive maintenance tracking system\nA?    Use of process equipment meeting industry design specifications\nA?    Use of state-of-the-art leak detection systems\nA?    Use of effective and constantly reviewed and revised operating procedures with input from operations and maintenance staff\nA?    Performance of in-depth hazard review of Risk Management Program-regulated processes and equipment\nA?    Implementation of a Risk Management Program audit program\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the use of air-line respirators for routine container connect/disconnects, presence of alarmed chlorine detectors in storage and feed areas, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine in use at the McMillan Water Treatment Plant.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no reportable accidents related to chlorine at the McMillan Water Treatment Plant. \n\nThe facility has an emergency response program that has been coordinated with the District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department.  The D.C. Fire Department will respond in the event of a chemical emergency.  The Incident Response Program contains an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  The latest table-top exercise with external participants occurred on February 19, 2004.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include the cont"
