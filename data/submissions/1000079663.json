FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one (1) - 30,000 gallon storage tank, and a number of nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity stored would be 400,000.\r\n\r\n3.  WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO:  A) The worst-case scenario has been removed from the executive summary for security reasons.  B) The alternate release scenario has been removed from the executive summary for security reasons.\r\n\r\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, G-2.1-2014\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference in the RULES AND REGULATIONS UNDER THE INDIANA AGRICULTURAL AMMONIA LAW 355 IAC.\r\n\r\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property"
