A chlorine monitor/alarm is situated in the room, with a tank and piping repair kit as well as dual scott packs provided on the outside door of the room for immediate response in the event of a Chlorine leak.  Chlorine lines are well marked, door is well labeled and MSDS sheet is posted.\n\nChlorine Leak\n\nMinor Chlorine leaks are a fairly common occurance during a routine Cylimder change.  These leaks are relatively small and are repaired or corrected with a minimum amount of problems.\n\nThe Water Department is well equipped to deal with major leaks and ruptures.  We have self contained breathing apparatus, CL2 tank repair kits and a supply of chlorinator repair parts to correct nearly any Chlorine leak.  Our staff has been trained in emergency procedures for CL2 leaks and safety equipment handling.  If a situation occurs where more than one tank ruptures or leaks, personnel on duty will follow procedures that are listed below:\n\n1.  Evacuation procedure will take effect immediately.\n2.  Superintendent will be notified and will notify the L.E.P.C. and the Village Manager.\n3.  Responsible personnel trained in the use of self breathing apparatus will gear up.\n4.  Telephone calls will be made to the Fire Department and Ambulance Corps to respond.\n5.
