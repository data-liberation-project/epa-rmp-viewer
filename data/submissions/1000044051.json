The facility is divided into two areas: Raw and Ready to Eat. The Raw portion of the plant receives, processes, and prepares meats for cooking or curing. The Ready to Eat portion of the plant packages the prepared products.\n\nProducts from this plant include Gallo Salame&reg; Italian Dry Salame and Pepperoni; Galileo&reg; Italian Dry Salame, Pepperoni; Deli d'Italia&reg; Italian Dry Salame, Genoa, Hillshire Farm&reg; Hard Salami and La Italia & reg Italian Dry Salame, Pepperoni, Aidells Salame. \n\n-A stationary anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used for room cooling and process chilling. The potential total anhydrous ammonia charge to the system is 15,000 pounds. This ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at this site to which the RMP requirements are applicable.\n\nThe site includes a large processing building with administration offices; the refrigeration engine room; the shipping and receiving areas; and employee and visitor parking lots.

The closed system cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the cooling and storage of the products and production rooms. Changes in the pressure are directly related to changes in temperature (i.e., lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature). Low pressure liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained with the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia and discharged to the atmosphere as it is condensed back into liquid. \n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at The Hillshire Brands Company- San Lorenzo is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.\n\n \n\n-This includes:\n\nAA?    Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification;\n\nAA?    Performance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information; \n\nAA?    Implementation of Operating Procedures.\n\nAA?

Performance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout/tagout and hot work permit programs;\n\nAA?

The plan is maintained at the site's Safety Office. The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation proceduresfor the control of ammonia releases.

The plant has a trained Emergency Action Team (EAT) that is capable of providing basic first aid and non-confined space personnel rescues and escape in hazardous environments. All members of the EAT have been fully certified in the safe use of an SCBA and have been provided both level A and B clothing.
