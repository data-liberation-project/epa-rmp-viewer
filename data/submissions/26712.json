The plant manufactures fresh pork and processed meats that provide consumers with high-quality meat products. This facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan submission to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\n\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Farmland Foods, Inc., Monmouth, Il.\n\n\n\nFacility Snapshot\n\nThis facility, was mostly constructed in 1963, was owned and operated by several owners prior to Farmland's acquisition of the plant in 1993.  The plant produces over 573 million pounds of product annually.\n\n\n\nImpact on the community\n\n* Farmland employs 1,190 area residents at a combined annual salary of approximately $36.6 million.\n\n* The facility purchases over $3 million of utilities, including electricity, natural gas, water, and wastewater treatment.\n\n* The facility paid over $270 million for materials and live hogs from the local area.\n\n\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nFarmland employees are involved in community activities.  The facility supports United Way and other community support organizations.  Employees are also active in many community organizations, such as Jaycees and the Chamber of Commerce.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe manag"

The response plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and emergency response agencies and the plant has interacted with possible responding agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the plant.  Employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and in possible response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.  The plant has a Hazmat Team made up of plant employees who are trained to respond in the event of a release on site.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is the only process at this facility that is covered by the EPA Risk Management Plan rule.\n\n\n\nThe facility has  58,135 pounds of ammonia on site which is used as a refrigerant in its ammonia refrigeration system.  This is a closed, contained system, in which the ammonia is recirculated to refrigerate the meat processing and storage areas in the plant. \n\nSynopsis o"

      "SummaryText": "f Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst-case and alternate  release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility, the regulated toxic substance is anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst-case event, unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.   It should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst-case scenario is extremely low. \n\n \n\nAlternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic and flammable substance, which are more likely events, must also be presented.  More likely release events tend to concentrate in areas such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses. Significantly lower quantities are involved and operator intervention would tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nThe largest vessel, located outdoors, has a maximum capacity of  21,040 pounds.  The worst case scenario assumes that this entire amount would release in 10 minutes, as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.  The worst-case scenario would reach offsite endpoints, including public and environmental receptors.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Toxics - Ammonia\n\nThis alternate release scenario consists of a pipe leak, which discharges 1,300 pounds of ammonia in 20 minutes prior to the operator stopping the leak. This scenario would reach offsite endpoints and would effect public and environmental receptors.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at this plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.
