In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and \nemployees, community officials, civic groups, the media, environmental groups, \nemergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\n\nCromwell Processing Plant Facility #83\n\nThe Perdue Farms, Cromwell Processing Plant Facility #83 is a poultry-processing plant \nlocated approximately 0.7 miles northwest of the intersection of Cromwell Road and \nHighway 231 in Cromwell, Kentucky.  This facility began operation in February 1996 \nand is currently bounded on all sides by farmland.  Perdue Farms currently has four (4) \nprocesses that contain regulated substances covered by EPA\u0012s 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented SPCC and PSM plans as part of the \noverall chemical management program.  The programs involve a wide-range of senior \nmanagement personnel (including Environmental Services Manager and Safety \nSupervisor).  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings that involve \nmany levels of personnel.  The facility also maintains a process safety management \nprogram as part of the overall chemical safety program.

The majority of the refrigeration components are \nlocated in the mechanical room, with the exception of the condensers located on the \nroof and piping located throughout the facility. \n\n2. Water Treatment Plant (chlorine)\nThe facility operates a water treatment plant (WTP) with a maximum capacity of 3 \nmillion gallons per day (MGD).  Currently, the WTP treats approximately two-MGD \nfor the facility and will later begin treatment of an additional one MGD for public \nwater supply.
