      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAtlas Pipeline Mid-Continent LLC owns and operates a non-fractionating natural gas plant, the Driver Gas Plant, in Midland County, Texas. The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquid are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for offsite sales.\n\n\n\nThe Driver Gas Plant is a new facility; however, Atlas Pipeline Mid-Continent LLC has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Driver Gas Plant is located near Midkiff, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products: \n\n\n\n1.    Y grade mixture from natural gas\n\n2.    Stabilized condensate\n\n3.    Residue gas\n\n\n\nThe Driver Gas Plant is an expansion of the existing Driver Compressor Station and since work is still underway in the expansion there has not yet been a review or update of the facility's Emergency Response (ER) plan.\n\n\n\nAlso, because this is a new facility ER training has not yet occured for this facility's employees.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Driver Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 107,075.553 pounds (30,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in an NGL Surge Tank. Using the EPA's RMP CO"

      "SummaryText": "MP Version 1.07 program, the entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion that reaches the 1 psi overpressure point at 0.4 miles. Since the facility is located in an unpopulated area the WCS will not affect offsite endpoints or public receptors. A consideration of the 0.4 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nAtlas's management is committed to doing the following:\n\n\n\n-Preventing accidents;\n\n-Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n-Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n-Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Atlas operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n-Being a good corporate citizen of Woods County.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the natural gas treatment and liquids recovery process. Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community.\n\n"
