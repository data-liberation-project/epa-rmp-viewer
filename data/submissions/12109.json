      "SummaryText": "Butte-Silver Bow Big Hole Water Treatment Facility, Feely Road\n\nAt The Big Hole Water Treatment Plant, we use approximately 110 pounds of Cholorine each day as part of the water treatment process that provides the community with safe drinking water and effective sanitation.  Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant.  It has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years reducing or eliminating the risk of such waterborn diseases as Cholera, Typhoid and Dysentery.\n\nBSB has long understood the hazards of handling Chlorine, which if not handled properly can pose a risk to the community.  Chlorine is listed  in the EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR).  Since BSB has more than 2,500 pounds of Chlorine on its site, it is required by the EPA to submit a Risk Management Plan.  The RMPR has helped enhance the exsiting safety programs such, as the respirator protection plan, a regular maintence program and an annual safety training program to address changes in the system and chemicals used at the facility.  It has also ensured that in the unlikely event of a release, local emergency responders and other authorities are fully trained and ready to engage specific plans to remediate the situation quickly and safely.\n\nThe Big Hole Water Treatment Facility has used Chlorine at its site to disinfect water for 5 years.  In the past five years, it has not experienced an accident involving Chlorine or the storage of Chlorine.\n\nThe Water Treatment Facility is operated by the City and County of Butte-Silver Bow and is a state of the art facility.  The Facility treats about 6,000,000 gallons of water per day.  The facility has been on-line since December 24, 1994, and is currently able to meet the needs of the City and County.  The Big Hole Water Treatment Facilitiy has had no reportable accidents within the past 5 years and is a very modern facility with many safety requirements built into it.\n\nThe U.S. EPA has developed the Risk Management Plan regulation"

      "SummaryText": "s to prevent and minimize the impacts of an accidental release from the Big Hole Water Treatment Facility.  These rules are applicable to the Big Hole Water Treatment Facility and are designed to prevent or address the impacts of a release from the plant site.  In an effort to comply with the regulations BSB has determined the worst case scenario and how to address a chemical release from the plant.  BSB has developed an emergency plan to deal with the possibility of a release.  The plan includes first responders, such as the BSB Fire Department, the BSB Sheriff's Department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the residences surrounding the facility.\n\nThe Big Hole Water Treatment Facility has performed the necessary Hazard Assessments, Prevention Programs, and Emergency Response Plans.  The employees of the Water Treatment Facility have been trained on the use of Chlorine and other chemicals throughout the plant.  They possess the necessary knowledge of the use of these chemicals and how to maintain the levels of these chemicals to minimize an exposure to themselves and others.\n\nBSB is confident that the added protection of the Risk Management Plan will ensure that its personnel, the environment and the community will continue to remain safe and healthy.\n\nPatrick T. McCarthy\nRisk Manager, Butte-Silver Bow"
