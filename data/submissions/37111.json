This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n? Introduction;\n? ATOFINA policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n? Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n? Hazard Assessment;\n? Prevention Program;\n? Five year accident history;\n? Emergency Response Plan;\n? Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at ATOFINA for many years; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  ATOFINA is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  \n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where plant personnel regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ATOFINA?s HES programs is reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.  \n\nATOFINA?s HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ATOFINA?s commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and or reduce the risk of accidents.  \n\nThe ATOFINA Carrollton facility is located at 2316 Highland Ave., Carrollton, Kentucky.  The facility is a specialty chemical manufacturer.  Certain substances used and p"

Chlorine and methyl chloride are present in covered processes at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.\n \nChlorine and methyl chloride are used as process feedstocks. Phosphorous Trichloride (PCL3) was reported in the original RMP submittal in 1999. Since that time, the plant has discontinued the product made with PCL3 and no longer stores or processes this chemical. \n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a liquid chlorine rail car.  It should be noted that both regulatory agencies and ATOFINA believe that the worst case scenario is an extremely unlikely event.  This Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by ATOFINA to reduce the risk of this type of event.  \n\nThe multiple layers of preventative measures make it unlikely that a significant chlorine release will occur.  Chlorine rail cars are built with extreme integrity and safety precautions.  The rail cars are rigorously designed and tested according to the procedures and schedules recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nIn addition, in the unlikely event that a release occurs, ATOFINA has an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.   These include:\n\n? Site emergency action plan;\n? Chlorine detectors;\n? Alarm system initiated by chlorine detectors;\n? Plant emergency alarm system;\n? Operators trained to make an initial response;\n? On-site emergency response team for each shift trained at the Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) technician level;\n? Medical department on-site; \n? Notification to LEPC to activate Community Response Plan.\n? Automatic shutoff valves that may be actuated from either the process control room or remote secuity station.\n?

This Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by ATOFINA to reduce the risk of these types of events.  \n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenarios are, by definition, more likely than the Worst-Case Scenario, they are still unlikely given the facility?s prevention program.  If a release should occur, ATOFINA has an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.  The mitigation measures identified for the Worst-case scenario would also apply to the Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that use chlorine and methyl chloride above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n? In-depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under OSHA PSM standards;\n? Written operating procedures (updated annually) are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n? Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;  \n? A safety work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly; \n? A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are reviewed and implemented safely;\n?

Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; and \n? Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n? Plant specification for chlorine piping that specifies welded pipe with a minimum of flanged connections.\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves our employees and strives for continuing improvements in accident reduction.  The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.  \n\nMeasures that would prevent the worst-case scenario primarily consist of chemical handling policies and standard operating procedures to ensure care in moving rail cars near and within the facility.  Delivery and on-site rail car handling personnel are highly trained and skilled, and rail cars are moved at very low speeds.  The integrity of the permanent onsite vessels is maintained through the mechanical integrity program via the aforementioned vessel inspections and tests.  The rail cars are protected from over pressurization with a pressure relief system.\n\nPotential hazards that could produce a catastrophic release are strictly controlled.  Rail cars are spotted and moved only in areas with no overhead construction or equipment that could fall and impact a car.  Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk of sabotage.  Construction throughout the facility is non-combustible, and fire hazards are strictly controlled.  The risk of fire induced vessel failure is extremely low.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine was selected as a valve packing failure.

The valves are designed to limit the rate of release to no more than 15,000 pounds per hour.  There are remotely operated valves which can be closed from the control room or remote security station should a problem occur.  This would serve to limit the release size and therefore, reduce the potential for off-site impact in the unlikely event of a release.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for methyl chloride is the release from a pipe leak.    Piping release scenarios could result from failures of flanges, fittings, or from a hole in the transfer piping.  Primarily, all transfer lines utilize welded connections, and the use of fittings and flanges is minimized.  Prevention steps for this scenario include strict adherence to piping and pipe support design standards, proper maintenance, inspections and tests under the mechanical integrity program.  Maintenance work practices are controlled to prevent mechanical impact or other piping stresses.\n\nFrom the beginning of 1999 to the present, there have been no accidents/releases of regulated substances from covered processes that meet the criteria for the Five Year Accident History, which are focused on serious accidents with either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. ATOFINA realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year accident History.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and in internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases. \n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the facility.
