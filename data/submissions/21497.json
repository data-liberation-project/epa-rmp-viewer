Programs have been implemented to ensure that every effort is made to prevent the release of any chemical substance. The chemicals on site are stringently monitored to this end.In the case of a release, programs are in place to alert the proper authorities as well as the proper responders in order to limit the effect of the release on the surrounding community. The stationary source and regulated chemicals are; 1. Hydrofluoric acid 70% CAS# 7664-39-3. The worst case scenario for Hydrgen floride/ Hydrfluoric acid 70% would be a 500# release over a period of 15min. This would be a release rate of 30# per. min. With urban surroundings the end point would be 0.1miles.this would be assuming the wind speed of 3.4 miles an hour with the stablity class of (F). The alternative scenario for Hydrogen Floride/ Hydrofluoric acid 70% would be a release rate of 30# over a period of 10 min. With urban surroundings the endpoint would be 0.1 miles, with a release rate of 3# per min. This would be assuming the wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour, stability class of (D). In both scenarios ther are no mitigation measures and no administrative controlles included with the exception of the (local Fire Department Haz-mat team). All products are received in containers that are sealed from the supplier. These are unloaded at the dock level and brought into the warehouse. These containers are inspected visualy on a daily bases. These drums are swrinkwraped to pallets, when the are needed for transportation they are loaded onto the trucks by forklift or pallet jack. The drums are again inspected before being loaded and upon delivery to the customer. All personel have been trained and certified on forklifts according to OS"

We do all that we can within our power to prevent any leak or loss to the environment and any possible harm to the community. The five year accident history is; 1995 no accidents.1996 no accindents. 1997 no accindents. 1998 no accindents. 1999 no accidents. If a release were to occure that has the potential to threaten human health or the environment outside of the facility or is a serious enough to warrant response beyond the capabilities of the site where the incident has taken place the on site  Emergency Coordinator will notify the following; The Hazardous Materials Team of Pompano Beach(911). The Pompano Beach Police department(911). The Florida Department of Environmental Protection, The National Response Center, The Flordia Division of Emergency Management, and the Broward County LEPC. The people on site will be evacuated to a common meeting place and a head count will be taken to determine if everyone is accounted for. The Police dept. and the Haz-mat team will decide on evacuation plans if necessary. The only changes available to Apperson Chemicals to improve safety is to lower inventories wherever possible."
