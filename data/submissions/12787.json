      "SummaryText": "The Chemtronics facility is located in the Cobb International Industrial Park in Kennesaw, Georgia.  This is a manufacturing facility which packages aerosol cleaners and degreasers used by the electronics industry.  There are two 18,000 gallon pressurized tanks on the property used for storage of two propane/isobutane blends used as aerosol propellants.  The aerosol filling process is conducted in an enclosed gas house which is equipped with a leak detection and emergency shutdown system.  Leak detection and shutdown systems are also in place in the tank storage area.\n\nIt is Chemtronics' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to prevent an accidental release.  Our worst case scenario would affect five offsite receptors.  There are no schools or hospitals within that distance, and no environmental receptors would be affected.  The alternative case scenario does not reach offsite receptors.  We have never had an accident involving propane/isobutane propellant that caused death, injury, property, or environmental damage.  \n\nThe facility was designed to comply with the NFPA-30b, 1994 edition, Code for the Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products.  The aerosol fillling process is compliant with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Cobb County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our propane/isobutane system.  The fire department is prepared with the equipment and trained personnel to respond effectively to an emergency involving a release of propane/isobutane propellant. \n\nWe have no plans at the present time to change our safety processes and procedures."
