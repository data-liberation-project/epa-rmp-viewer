      "SummaryText": "Western Midstream Fort Lupton Complex Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Western Midstream Ft. Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster complex. The complex is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\n\n\n\nThe Fort Lupton Complex is a natural gas processing facility made up of three separate processing facilities (Lancaster, Platte Valley and Fort Lupton) designed to process natural gas from wells within the DJ basin. The designed total capacity of this facility is 850 MMCFD. The main focus of these facilities is to process natural gas within acceptable pipeline specifications. Acceptable pipeline specifications mean the removal of water, CO2 and H2S. \n\n\n\nThis facility takes raw and semi-treated natural gas into the facility from two different sources. Dehydrated high-pressure gas from field compressor stations delivered at approximately 1100 psig. The second source is from a low-pressure inlet that operates around 90 psig and is compressed up to approximately 1100 psig. The low-pressure gas is blended with the high-pressure gas for delivery to the Lancaster Plant. The Platte Valley and Fort Lupton plants use only the dehydrated high-pressure gas. The gas then goes through a process of cooling, using refrigeration, exchangers, and high-speed expanders to drop the temperature and pressure. This pressure and temperature drop help with the separation of the methane gas and natural gas liquids.\n\n\n\nReciprocating and centrifugal compressors are used to compress the methane gas up to approximately 900 psig and transported through pipelines to end users including the local utility companies. \n\n\n\nThe second focus of the facility is to recover natural gas liquids from the raw natural gas. This liquid is then transported down pipeline as a \"Y\" grade product (all components combined) for further processing or fractionated on site into sellable by-products (ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasoline)."

      "SummaryText": " These fractionated products are then transported by truck to local market or pipelined for further processing. Third party raw natural gas liquids are also brought into the Fort Lupton Complex by trucks for fractionating. \n\n\n\nPrior to being fractionated the natural gas liquids must go through a sweetening process where excess corrosive gases (H2S and CO2) are stripped from the natural gas liquids. \n\n\n\nA sweetening process is also used to remove corrosive gases (H2S and CO2) prior to entry into the Lancaster plant. This process utilizes a solvent called Amine to remove excess H2S and CO2 from the gas stream. The amine is circulated through a contact tower where it comes into contact with the gas stream removing the excess H2S and CO2. This rich amine is regenerated to remove the corrosive gases. After the gases are removed the process starts over. The corrosive gases that are removed during the regeneration process flow through a reactor bed to remove the H2S then to a thermal oxidizer to incinerate any hydrocarbons remaining in the CO2 stream. \n\n\n\nA refrigeration system is used to add in the cooling of the processes. The refrigeration system uses propane as a refrigerant. The propane is vaporized during the chilling process, recompressed using reciprocating and screw compressors then condensed back down to liquid propane where it starts the process over. The refrigeration system is utilized in both the process plants and fractionators.\n\n\n\nHot oil is used to provide the needed heat to many processes within the facility. The hot oil systems are closed loop systems. The oil is heated as high as 425?F and circulated through various reboilers and exchangers in the processes as needed to keep products within the required specifications.   \n\n\n\nThe final process within the facilities is to stabilize the liquids brought in from the low pressure and high-pressure pipelines. Gas is separated from the liquids in inlet slug catchers with the gases being compressed for feed to t"

The ethane is recompressed and sent back to the facility inlet piping while the liquid is sent to storage tanks to be blended with the natural gas liquids for fractionation or sale to the pipelines.\n\n\n\nA flare system provides a safe way of burning off excess gas from various processes within the plant (i.e., safety relief valves, pressure control valves, vessel/line blowdowns) during normal and emergency operations at the plant. The flare system can handle the full volume of the plant.\n\n\n\nThe total storage capacity between the three facilities exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold for these components and therefore the complex is subject to the requirements in the EPA Risk Management plan.\n\n\n\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Release Prevention Program that are in place at the Fort Lupton Facility.\n\n\n\n1.1. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Fort Lupton Facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the processes. Process Safety Information includes information pertaining to hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process, technology of the process, and equipment in the process. Examples of Process Safety Information include but are not limited to safety data sheets and process flow diagrams. Process Safety Information is updated using the Management of Change (MOC) process. This information informs employees of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the processes. \n\n\n\n1.2. PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Fort Lupton Facility uses one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n\n-What if\n\n-What If/Checklist\n\n-Hazard and Operabil"

The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as prevention and mitigation measures currently in place and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary to reduce risks to as low as reasonably practicable. Recommendations are reviewed by the Fort Lupton Management Team and after approval, corrective actions are assigned and distributed to impacted personnel for follow-up. \n\n\n\nAction items are tracked to closure as outlined in the Corrective Action and Preventive Action Procedure to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner. Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the PHA. PHAs are revalidated at least every five years. The revalidation includes a review of the changes and incidents that have taken place in the process since the last PHA and includes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\n\n\n1.3. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed for each process area, which address initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and start-up following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. These operating procedures are stored electronically on an internal server for employee access and are periodically reviewed and revised. \n\n\n\n1.4. TRAINING\n\n\n\nThe Fort Lupton Facility's Training program includes formal on-boarding, job-specific training, compliance training, and safety training. Each employee involved in operating a process is trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures developed for that process. The Safety Manager or their designee is responsible for scheduling and coordina"

MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment. The Fort Lupton Facility has several written programs in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenance of process equipment. Mechanical Training is routinely conducted, and procedures are periodically reviewed and updated. \n\n\n\n1.6. MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe Management of Change (MOC) program is intended to cover changes to the process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures, and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process. The Fort Lupton Facility reviews and approves a proposed modification at conception under the MOC/PSSR process prior to addressing the change. The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed, the MOC is approved for change implementation. Training requirements for affected personnel will vary depending on the significance of the change. For changes requiring significant updates to procedures or equipment, special training sessions (meeting the training requirements of the company's RMP/PSM programs) may be necessary for operators, mechanics, and/or contractors. For less significant changes, simply communicating information about the change and its anticipated effects on operation/maintenance may substitute for training sessions.\n\n\n\n1.7. PRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety review (PSSR) must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The pre-startup safety process is used in conjunction with the Management of Change (MOC) process. If the change triggers a PSSR, then approval for startup also requires satis"
