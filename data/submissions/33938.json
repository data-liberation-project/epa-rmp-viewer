Daily equipment and maintenance checks helps to ensure the equipment is maintained and operated in accordance to the requirements of its Process Safety Management (Program Level 3); thus, reducing the likelihood of an accidental release.  In the event of an accidental release as defined in our PSM program, it is our policy to notify the Jasper Fire Department\u00bfs Hazardous Materials Team to aid in the response.  \n\nThrough these programs and emergency response policies, Marshall Durbin Companies strives for safe operation for the employees and surrounding community.  \n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAt this facility, anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant.  This refrigerant allows for production processes to make ice, cool and store fresh poultry.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia present at this facility is 17532 pounds.  The anhydrous ammonia is in a closed system.  The anhydrous ammonia circulates and re-circulates through the system.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has not been a reportable accident within the last five years and five years prior to the previous submission.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAt this facility is an active Process Safety Management (PSM) system to help ensure that the refrigerated anhydrous ammonia system is maintained and operated in a safe manner.  The PSM system is composed of 13 elements to help ensure the safe operation of its anhydrous ammonia processes.
