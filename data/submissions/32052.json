This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n  Introduction;\n  ATOFINA Chemicals? Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety;\n  Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes;\n  Prevention Program;\n  Five-Year Accident History;\n  Emergency Response Plan; \n  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\nATOFINA CHEMICALS POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at ATOFINA Chemicals for many years; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  ATOFINA Chemicals is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the management team and the Joint Health, Environment, and Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, implement enhancements, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ATOFINA Chemicals HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nATOFINA Chemicals HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ATOFINA Chemicals commitment to health, environment, and safety.

Our products are used to produce a wide variety of products including photographic products, pharmaceuticals, electronics, cosmetics, paints, cleaners, tires, water treatment products, and agricultural chemicals.  \n\nCertain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  \n\nAmmonia, chlorine, dimethylamine, ethylene oxide, ethyl mercaptan, furan, isopropylamine, methylamine, and methyl mercaptan, are used as process feedstocks.  Monoethylamine is produced at the facility and is also used as a process feedstock.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP "

Therefore all references to propylene oxide have been deleted from the Risk Management Plan.\n\n   \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nATOFINA Chemicals has a prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910. 119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle covered chemicals above the threshold quantity of either the PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n -In-depth process hazard analyses are completed at least every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved     under the OSHA PSM standards;\n\n -Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three  years;\n\n -Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n -A safety work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly;\n\n -A management system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely;\n\n -Critical equipment, including instruments, is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating conditions;\n\n -Pre-startup reviews are done to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\n\n -Incidents, including near-misses, are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; \n\n -Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed;\n\n -Periodic process walk-through inspections are conducted by supervisors; and\n\n -Routi"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nMeasures that would prevent worst-case scenarios for chlorine and dimethylamine include:\n\n -The tanks are pressure vessels which are designed and constructed in accordance with industry pressure vessel standards using industry-standard materials of construction;\n\n -As part of the Mechanical Integrity program, and per DOT requirements pressure vessels are periodically inspected and tested;\n\n -The risk of over-pressure is addressed by a system of pressure relief valves installed on the vessels;\n\n -Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk to the tanks of vehicular damage or sabotage;\n\n - Fire hazards are controlled through procedures, training, and the hot work permit system; and\n\n -Continuous observation is required during the unloading of any toxic gas (chlorine) per DOT requirements. \n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nPrevention measures for the alternative scenarios selected for anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, dimethylamine, furan, and methyl mercaptan include:\n\n -Railcar and tank truck stops (or wheel chocks) to prevent movement of a railcar or tank truck;\n\n -Signage that indicates railcar unloading;\n\n -Careful control of the switching of railcars, including proper training and procedures that prohibit hooking up to a car that is still connected;\n\n -Replacing flexible hose connections and railcar fittings on a frequent basis to ensure hoses are always in good condition;\n\n -Frequent inspection of unloading lines to ensure the lines a"

In July 2001, there was a release and subsequent fire of methyl mercaptan that also resulted in a release of chlorine.  There was an estimated 27,000 lbs of chlorine and an unknown quantity of methyl mercaptan and decomposition products released during this incident. There were three fatalities and eight additional recordable injuries as a result of this incident.  In addition, houses in the area were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  \n\nATOFINA Chemicals realizes that the community may also be interested in information on how ATOFINA responds to smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and in internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the ATOFINA Chemicals facility.  The plan was developed in cooperation and was coordinated with the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee, local fire departments, and other emergency responders have copies of these plans.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident.  The plan also include"

Some drills are done with the local fire and police departments and critiqued by members of the community.  ATOFINA Chemicals on-site emergency equipment includes a fully equipped fire truck with fire fighting foam capability and a 2,000-gallon vacuum truck for quickly collecting spills.  There are first-aid trained personnel on each shift.  The ATOFINA Chemicals Emergency Response Team receives over 40 hours of annual emergency response training. \n\n  \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nATOFINA Chemicals is improving monitoring and modeling capabilities for potential releases.   The additional information that will be provided is intended to improve emergency response capabilities."
