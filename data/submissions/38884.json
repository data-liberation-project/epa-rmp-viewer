Also the City of Forest Fire Dept. has one complete ton emergency repair kit and the fire fighters are trained in how to handle a chlorine release.  The Fire Dept. is trained to put to put up a water curtain if needed to contain the release as much as possible.  We also have a chlorine sensor and alarm to alert the operator with the use of an automated dialer that dials pagers.  Also we have two more complete ton chlorine cylinder repair kits with four additional self-contained air packs at the wastewater treatment plant.  The operator at the water wells checks all of the chlorination systems at least daily.  If we have a release that requires people to evacuate for a certain area we use the police dept. and all forces to accomplish this action."
