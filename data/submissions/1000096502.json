The Plan was updated and resubmitted in November 2021 by the City of New Iberia. \n\n This facility is subject to requirements of this program due to the usage and storage of chlorine in an amount greater than 2,500 lbs.  The facility does not maintain TQs of SO2 which trigger applicability for SO2. \n\n\n\nThe facility is located outside the city limits of New Iberia, LA at the end of Parker St., off of LA Highway 87.  The area surrounding the facility consists of agricultural fields and residential subdivisions to the north and south of the plant.  The latitude and longitude of the facility were obtained from GPS coordinates.\n\n\n\nTreatment includes the chlorination of the treated water prior to being disposed of into the Bayou Teche.  Chlorine is mixed with water  at a rate that is flow proportional.  Once the chlorine is injected into the water it is diluted to an amount, which is less than 1% chlorine, by weight.  The chlorine-water mixture is then routed to the contact chamber where the wastewater is disinfected.  The part of this process that is subject to the RMP requirements begins with the chlorine supply (two 1 ton containers) and ends at the point where it is injected into the water.  The facility uses approximately one cylinder of chlorine every month.  The wastewater plant stores a maximum of two-one ton containers (4,000 lbs.) of chlorine at any one time.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario chlorine involves the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)- Determination of worst-case release quantity.  This type of release may occur as a result of catastrophic natural or other unforeseen disaster.  A release of 2,000 lbs. for a dura"

This endpoint, developed by the American Industrial Hygiene association, is the location where minimal effects of exposure to the toxic substance are likely to occur.  This distance encompasses mostly residential areas, recreational parks, churches, schools and farmland, from LA Hwy 182 at Nelson Canal Road to Tete Bayou just before Crochet Rd. and from Neco Town Road at the power station to just before LA Hwy 86.  Using MARPLOT v5.1.1 software developed by the USEPA and NOAA, the population residing within an area encompassing a circle with a 1.3 mile radius(worst-case release circle) is 3,292 people.  Refer to Section 5.0 for the vicinity map, which depicts the worst-case release circle and for details of public and environmental receptors.\n\n\n\nAn alternative case or a more likely release of chlorine could occur as the result of a cracked or split hose, sudden hose un-coupling, seal failures, over-pressurization, holes formed in ton containers as a result of punctures or corrosion, valve failures, regulator seal, or gasket leak.  The plant is equipped with a leak detection system that has sensors located near the cylinders and the plant employees are on-site 24 hours per day.  If 1-ppm leak of CL2 is detected an alarm will sound and according to facility personnel, it would take less than 1 minute for on-site personnel to respond by closing the flow valve and thus stopping the leak.  Assuming the chlorine flashes to the atmosphere at a rate of 0.5 cf/min for a maximum of 5 minutes (0.5 lbs. of chlorine) the distance to the toxic endpoint is less than 0.1 miles.  The area within 0.1 miles of the facility encompasses mostly farmland and a few residents located to the south and west of the facility. Using MARPLOT v5.1.1 software developed by the USEPA and NOAA, the population residing within an area encompassing a circle with a 0.1 mile radius(worst-case release circle) is 0 people,"

Refer to Section 5.0 for the vicinity map, which depicts the worst-case release circle and for details of public and environmental receptors. \n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release, which caused on or off site injury, death, or property damage within the past five years.\n\n\n\nFacility employees are properly trained in the operating and maintenance procedures.  These procedures are kept on-site within the O & M Manuals.  Records of inspections, testing, and maintenance are also kept on file at the facility.\n\n\n\nWritten emergency response procedures have been developed and are kept on file at the facility.  Emergency response procedures within this manual describe actions for incidental response for facility personnel in the event of a relatively small leak or release that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  If incidental response activities do not halt the release or the release poses an immediate safety or health hazard, specially trained response personnel are contacted to take over response activities.  In the event of a chlorine leak or release, employees are instructed to assess the situation and to determine if it is safe to discontinue the leak without the help of emergency responders.  If there are any doubts as to the safety of the release, the employees are to initiate the written notification procedures.  Details to these procedures are found in Section 7.0 of the manual.\n\n\n\nCurrent safety features installed at the facility include the leak detection system, and 24 hr/day on-site personnel.  Inspections of the process and associated equipment are conducted on a regular basis to avoid failure and detect normal wear and tear of equipment parts.\n\n\n\nFacilities with worst-case release scenarios that affect public or environmental receptors and utilize private contractors to operate the facility are subject to OSHA's process safety management program, and therefore a"
