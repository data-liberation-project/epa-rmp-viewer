              "Description": "This process includes two interconnected production units, Aqueous Choline and Choline Salts. All information included in this prevention program applies to both units with the following exceptions: - Only Aqueous Choline operates with all valves opened. The valves will close automatically due to loss of system pressure under the following conditions; loss of nitrogen supply, rupture of nitrogen tubing due to mechanical failure, a fire at the unloading pump causing the plastic tubing to melt, resulting in sealing the vessel, power failure, switch being manually turned, high storage tank temperature, and high rate of rise in storage tank level. Vessels are equipped with relief valves and high level indicators. The Aqueous Choline system is equipped with a camera monitoring device as an additional safeguard in detecting any deficiencies in the safe operation of the process and to lessen the risk of any accidental releases.

Both are present in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity for applicability of EPA's Accidental Release Program. Ethylene oxide ( a toxic chemical), and trimethylamine (a flammable chemical) are utilized at this facility for the manufacture of nutritional supplements, animal food products for the poultry, beef, dairy, and companion animal industry, and also in the oil well production industry. Ethylene oxide is also repackaged for use in the sterilization of medical implements and spices. BCP Ingredients commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment for employees, as well as providing a safe and healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring and detection systems. BCP Ingredients adheres to all applicable Federal, State, and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these and all chemicals. All information regarding BCP Ingredients Risk Management Plan has been submitted to EPA utilizing EPA's RMP eSubmit Software.                                                                                                                                                               \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nBCP Ingredients complies with the Process Safety Management Rule of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 for the prevention of hazardous chemical releases, and is therefore subject to the requirements of EPA's Program 3 instead of Program 2. It should be noted that no data is reported for Program 2 in the RMP eSubmit data because BCP Ingredients is subject only to Program 3. Program 3 ( which is OSHA's Process Safety Management Plan) is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis,"

The Process Safety Management Program ensures that the processes and the equipment in the processes are designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards, and that the processes follow good engineering practices. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes continuous inspections and testing of equipment and monitoring devices in the processes to detect any deficiencies and correct them before it contributes to a potential release incident.

It is BCP Ingredients policy to contact 911 (which is dispatched through the Monett, MO police department).The local emergency planning committee and the local fire departments will be contacted by them in the event of a hazardous chemical release. BCP Ingredients has contracted an emergency response group (Environmental Management Inc.) that will respond to any hazardous chemical release requiring any cleanup operation. BCP Ingredients has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on it's emergency action plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, they will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is nece"
