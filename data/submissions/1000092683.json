The ammonia refrigeration process at High Liner (process) has been designed and operates in compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations. High Liner has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule. \n\n\n\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan (i.e., Integrated Contingency Plan) as required under OSHA PSM, High Liner has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nHigh Liner is a food processing facility primarily engaged in the preparation and packaging of seafood products.  The regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is stored and utilized within the facility's anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process.  The ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As High Liner's anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at High Liner is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\n\n\n\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program 1.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with American National Standa"

Process verification takes place through design audits by trained personnel and/or certified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.\n\n\n\nAn off-site consequences analysis has been completed for the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario to document the radius of impact (i.e., distance to toxic endpoint) for each scenario and the potential population, public receptors and environmental receptors that fall within the radius of impact for each scenario. \n\n\n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of High Liner's daily operations.  PM is performed in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases; the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by High Liner exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  Ammonia detection sensors are present and are tested at a minimum every six months.  Relief valves are replaced on a five-year schedule. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there have been no releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located throughout the building that trigger a strobe in the engine room and notify the 24 hour Security Guard office.  Security would then contact the refrigeration mechanic on call.  An investigation would be initiated immediately by donning appropriate PPE and an ammonia monitor. Communication would also be made with the site manager/supervisors and security guards to give directions such as to initiate an evacuation. \n\n\n\nHigh Liner Foods Newport News has coordinated response with the Newport News Fire Department and Hazmat Team to ass"

Upon investigation, if High Liner Foods determines that the release is severe enough to require outside response assistance; \n\n?    Reportable quantities of ammonia are released; \n\n?    There is a potential for fire; or\n\n?    There is injury or illness from ammonia exposure.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nHigh Liner Foods conducts a 5 year PHA to assist with identifying areas where process improvements could improve safety.  Also, an annual capital budget process is reviewed and funded with regards to the ammonia system.  This is generated from staff input, PSM team meetings, audits, inspections, outside consultants, and testing."
