The Risk Management Plan for the Sara Lee Frozen Bakery facility has been prepared for the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia in the facility's refrigeration system.  Each part of the RMP is submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency, meeting or exceeding the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.  \r\n\r\nThe submission is due to the need to fulfill the requirements mandated by the EPA for a new submission or an update to occur every 5 years. The RMP was resubmitted in accordance with the 5-year update requirement.  \r\n\r\n-Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response or Emergency Action Policies-\r\n\r\nThe Sara Lee Frozen Bakery facility recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The controls of accidents have been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Sara Lee Frozen Bakery facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established an Emergency Action Plan.  The objectives of the Emergency Action Plan are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response or action programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation. Ryan Lippert , the Bakery Plant Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs is to prevent"

      "SummaryText": "the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n-Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled-\r\n\r\nThe Sara Lee Frozen Bakery facility includes two ammonia refrigeration systems (the North System and South System) to provide process cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) contained in each of the systems is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in the North System is 61,453 lbs. of ammonia, the maximum quantity of ammonia held during the calendar year in the South System is 43,352 lbs. The sum of these two systems is 104,805 lbs. of ammonia. The EPA instructs to round this number to two significant figures, leading to a 100,000 recorded maximum quantity. Since an ammonia release from the systems could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulated, the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\r\n\r\n-The Prevention Program-\r\n\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses on efforts at the Sara Lee Frozen Bakery facility to contain the refrigerant inside the systems.  The goal is to reduce the risk of injury and promote safer practices at the Sara Lee Frozen Bakery facility. The following items are included in the Prevention Program in relation to requirements for Program Level 3"
