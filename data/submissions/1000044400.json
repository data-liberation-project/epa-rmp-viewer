As required by U.S. EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68, the facility's RMP must be fully updated and resubmitted at least once every 5 years.  Since the first renewal was submitted on June 7, 2004 and the second renewal was submittedon June 17, 2009, the 5-year anniversary date for resubmission is set as 5 years from June 17, 2009 or June 17, 2014.  This submittal constitutes the 2014 RMP 5-year update for AK Steel Corporation in Middletown, Ohio required to be completed by June 17, 2014.\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAK Steel Corporation in Middletown, Ohio complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68).  The enclosed Risk Management Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of ammonia.  Through our compliance with Part 68, we promote overall plant, worker, and community safety.  Our Risk Management Program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. \n\n\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the spirit and the letter of EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).  The Company has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.  The Middletown facility's Risk Management System has clearly defined lines of authority and designation of responsibilities to ensure that the risk management pla"

AK Steel's safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\n\n\nAK Steel's Middletown, Ohio manufacturing facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (112r) of the Clean Air Act, due to one on-site process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantity.   Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in a quantity greater than its 10,000 pound threshold and is Program 3.   Hydrogen, a regulated flammable substance, which was formerly a Program 1 regulated substance at the facility reduced the maximum quantity stored onsite in October 2008 and is therefore, no longer subject to RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Middletown facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention program rules for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for ammonia at the Middletown facility.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME, ANSI, API, and other industry codes and standards.  A process hazard review was conducted for ammonia and all identified problems were addressed.  Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia equipment and operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia have occurred during the last five years that resulted in an offsite impact of any kind.  However, during the pa"

      "SummaryText": "st five years, there has been one reportable accident related to the ammonia process at AK Steel Middletown Works resulting in a Section 69.10(b)(1) listed consequence (injury).   On October 1, 2011 at 12:30 pm an accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia occurred.  An employee was in the process of opening a suction valve when some anhydrous ammonia was released from the valve flange.  The employee immediately closed the valve.  The released ammonia came in contact with the employee causing an injury that required medical treatment.  The incident lasted for less than a minute.  It is estimated that less than one pound of Anhydrous Ammonia was released from this event.   \n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program at the Middletown facility is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with the Butler County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Middletown Fire Department.  The AK Steel response team trains and drills monthly.  We have conducted periodic drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and fire department. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the fire department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors."
