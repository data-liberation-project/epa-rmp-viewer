The Gas Plant was shut down in 2009 and significant equipment inspection, reconditioning and equipment replacement was completed to bring the Plant up to Chevron expectations for Plant equipment mechanical integrity and operability. Operations were started back up in October 2009. \n\t\n\tThe gas plant, located in the Table Rock gas field (approx. 45 miles east of Rock Springs, Wyoming), is configured to process 10-60 mmscfd of natural occurring hydrocarbon gas and natural gas liquids.\n\t\n\tChevron has approximatel20-36 employees, and contractors working for the Asset.  Consisting of Operations, Maintenance and support staff \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Chevron USA Production Company to conduct its business in a socially responsible and ethical manner that protects safety, health and the environment in accordance with the Chevron Way. The TRGP Emergency Preparedness and Response Policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident; developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks; communicating relevant information to employees, contractors and appropriate agencies; and conducting emergency exercises.\n\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES\n\nGas Processing Unit\n\n\tSour natural occurring hydrocarbon gas from approx 11 wells is gathered at the Plant Inlet and compressed to processing pressure for further processing in the gas plant.\n\nHydrocarbon Liquids and produced water are separated from the gas stream upstream of the compression facility.\n\nThe liquid hydrocarbons are batch shipped by truck and sold on the market. The produced water is treated and injected down hole in a permitted injection well.\n\nThe H2S/CO2 Removal system is designed to remove H2S/CO2 from the naturally occurring hydrocarbon gases from the Plant inlet. \n\nThe sour gas stream is fed to the H2S Contactor for contacting with a MDEA solution. H2S/CO2 is abso"

(Ammonium biosulphide)\n\nThe ABS solution and Tail Gas is reacted in the Tail Gas Unit equipment.\n\nAmmonium thiosulfate (liquid fertilizer) is produced from the reaction and stored for marketing in the ATS Storage Tank.\n\nThe ATS is shipped to market by tank truck or rail car.\n\nThe Tail Gas from the Plant is then lofted to the atmosphere via the Tail Gas Stack at or below Wyoming State DEQ permitted levels for emission components.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES ABOVE THRESHOLD QUANTITIES AT TRGP\n\nThere are two RMP defined processes with threshold quantities of regulated substances at TRGP including:\n\nProcess 1: Flammables\n\nInlet flows and quantities of flammable, naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and H2S. The total quantities found in the process vessels, process piping, storage bullets and miscellaneous equipment above the threshold limit.\n\n\nProcess 2: Toxics\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is delivered by rail car and off loaded into the Anhydrous Ammonia storage vessel for use in the ABS/ATS Tail Gas Unit in quantities above the threshold limi"

Although Chevron has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. While the calculated maximum distance to endpoint (1 psi overpressure) for the WCS of Process 1 is beyond the plant boundaries, there are no public receptors within that calculated radius due to the remote location of the gas plant\n\n\nProcess 2- Toxics\n\nThe Worst-Case release Scenario (WCS) for toxic substances is loss of containment of the storage vessel, V-305 which contains quantities above the threshold limit of Anhydrous Ammonia. This scenario assumes that the entire contents of this vessel are released in 10 minutes.\n\nAlthough Chevron has numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage their \nconsequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken \ninto account in evaluating this scenario. While the calculated maximum distance to the toxic \nend point for the WCS of Process 2 is beyond the plant boundaries, there are no public receptors \nwithin that calculated radius due to the remote location of the gas plant. There is a normally \nunoccupied third party storage and telecom equipment building with access un-controlled by \nTRGP which is located within the toxic end point for this release scenario.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nChevron encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.
