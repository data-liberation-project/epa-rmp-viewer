The distance to the endpoint point of detonation is .40 miles. \n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of detonation) is .10 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of NFPA 58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage and also the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.for general safety.\n\n\n\n \n5.
