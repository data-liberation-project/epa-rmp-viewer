      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Acadia Power Station (APS) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for APS workers, the public, and the environment. It is APS's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. As part of this policy, APS has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) Plan that helps manage the risks at APS and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAPS, which is located in Eunice, Louisiana, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity. As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the four gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams. Anhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in two dedicated, specially designed storage tanks. The storage capacity of each tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability. There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.  APS is subject to OSHA's PSM standard as well as Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule.\n\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, the worst case scenario is the highly unlikely catastrophic rupture of one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. The release duration is ten minutes. The 18,000-gallon tank is limited to 85% of the storage capacity (15,300-gallons) by administrative controls, including operating procedures and high level alarms. The EPA's RMP*Comp was used in the analysis. Passive mitigation exists in the form of a dike around the tank, which limits the spread of ammonia. Based on the "

It was analyzed as the failure of a 2-inch unloading hose at the delivery truck unloading point. The release would be mitigated via an excess flow valve on the delivery truck and by automatic shut off valves on the ammonia loading header. \n\n\n\nThe EPA's RMP*Comp software was used in the analysis. Based on the analysis, there are no that public receptors would be affected by the alternative release scenario (2010 U.S.Census data used with MARPLOT).\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAPS has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, of APS employees and to the preservation of the environment. One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. APS utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. In addition to handling the release, the facility has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. In conjunction with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the facility has ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation has always been a goal at APS. Keeping employees informed and involved creates a team unity atmosphere. Employees have participated on Process Hazards Analysis Teams and have access to all safety information. This information along with updated Operation Manuals are kept in the plant document control room. Operation ma"

These operation manuals assist employees in refresher training and operator recertification programs.\n\n\n\nSafety meetings are held on a regular basis for Operations, Maintenance, Administration and Contract personnel. Regulations updates and safety procedures are the main topics during these safety meetings. All meetings are documented and kept on file. Administration also has safety meetings as necessary. Safety concerns, programs, audits, employee participation and other safety ideas are discussed during the meetings.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nAPS maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets. This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, APS has documented safety-related upper and lower process limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit. APS ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nAPS also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  APS has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is completed within six months if feasible. Any item that cannot be taken care of within six months is documented and justified. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained by the Safety Manager.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, APS periodically updates and revalidates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nAPS maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified by the Safety Manager as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the APS operating procedures discuss consequences of deviating from the safe limits and provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, APS has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in APS operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nAPS uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, APS has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform APS personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, APS pre-qualifies contractors based on their safety record and evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. APS personnel periodically monitors contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\n\n\nAPS conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information (not required for replacement in kind). The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting training, (4) performing and documenting inspections and tests, (5) correcting identified deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nAPS has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.
