      "SummaryText": "Mennel Millling Company operates a mill in Mt. Olive, Illinois that processes wheat into several different grades of flour. Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is added to the the milled flour to achieve the desired pH. The amount of chlorine added varies depending on the desired characteristics of the flour and the type and nature of the incoming wheat.\n\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. and used in one ton containers. The supplier delivers full chlorine containers to the site via truck. The containers are unloaded by the supplier directly onto specially designed wheeled cars. Mennel Milling staff then positions the carts in the chlorine room and connects the ton containers to the feed system. The chlorine room was designed to hold a maximum of four ton containers. Mennel Milling intends to have a maximum of four containers on site at any one time. Therefore, the maximum current inventory is 8,000 pounds.\n\nMennel Milling Co. uses a vacuum feed system for the application of chlorine that is inherently safe.  This system involves the use of low-pressure air flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.\n\nMennel Milling Co. has contracted with Research Products Co. (REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and corrective maintenance on the chlorine feed systems. \n\nMennel Milling Co. has developed a comprehensive, accidental release prevention program as part of the OSHA PSM program. The elements of this program include: \n *Process Safety Information\n *Process Hazard Analysis\n *Operating Procedures\n *Training\n *Management of Change\n *Pre-Startup Safety Review\n *Compliance Audits\n *Incident Investigation \n *Contractor Management\n *Hot Work Permit"

      "SummaryText": "s\n \nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at Mennel Milling Co. that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nThe Macoupin County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Mt. Olive Fire Department have been contacted by Mennel in an attempt to coordinate response efforts and to become included in the community emergency response plan. An Emergency Action Plan for the site has been implemented. This plan contains measures that Mennel Milling staff can take to alert employees to a release, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significant release, and many other elements. Mennel Milling will receive training to allow for defensive action in response to an on-site release. \n\nIn the past two years, a programmable logic controller(PLC) has been added to control the milling process as well as chlorine addition. It has enabled Mennel Milling to stop the flow of chlorine to the agitators for any number of reasons. These reasons include but are not limited to: a chlorine leak detected in either the chlorine room or by the agitators where chlorine is applied to the flour; any motor in the process including the agitators that would stop for any reason; a choke situation that is set up to suspend milling operations. An alarm system is tied to to PLC and sends out a page. Each mill employee carries a pager and is alerted to any of these conditions.  \n\nMennel Milling Co. has performed a hazard evaluation for the chlorination processes at the facility. As a result of this evaluation, a change is planned to improve safety. This change is:\n1. Strobe lights or a horn will be added on each floor that will be tied into the PLC to further alert employees of leaks."
