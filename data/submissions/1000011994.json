Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\n\nMGC Pure complies with applicable federal, state and local regulations.  This facility has a formal worker safety program.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe MGC Pure facility is located in Mesa, AZ.  This facility produces ultra-pure ammonium hydroxide.  The regulated substances at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, and ammonium hydroxide are used in a delivery system to create ultra pure ammonium hydroxide.\n\n3.   Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nPlease reference onsite data (Volume 1: Risk Management Plan) at the MGC Pure facility for offsite consequence analysis data.\n\n4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nMGC Pure complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia supply and delivery systems.  Further, delivery system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the system.\n\nThe ammonia delivery system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located in the DCS logic, alarms actuated by high release concentrations of ammonia, and safety relief valves to ave"

Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years this facility has had no significant accidental releases of ammonia.\n\n6.   Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).  Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.  The Maricopa County LEPC has been notified regarding the emergency action plan and of the potential nature of an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of a PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia process. The MGC Pure facility expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
