The same properties that make hydrofluoric acid valuable as a commodity also make is necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co- workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle hydrofluoric acid, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\tThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potential affected neighbors.\n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\tTwo (2) 55-gallon drums of a 70% hydrofluoric acid solution are unloaded and stored within a building.  Approximately 29 gallons of the solutions is pumped into a process tank containing approximately 399 gallons of water.  Metal parts are dipped into the tank as part of a passivation process.  Passivation is the changing of the chemically active surface of a metal to a less reactive state by means of an acid dip.\n\tAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized manage- ment personnel and authorized contractors.   The regulate substance handled at this facility is hydrofluoric acid.  The total inventory of hydrofluoric acid stored at this plant is 1,080 pounds.\n\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario\n\n\tWorst-Case Scenario - A spill of a drum of hydrofluoric acid would release 540 po"
