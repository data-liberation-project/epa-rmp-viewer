Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates an uncrustables plant at 1070 Smith Grove Road, Scottsville, Kentucky.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, in which to freeze their product for storage and distribution.  Due to the number of safety features put in place to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the environment and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system would pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\n\n\nThe facility completed, in 2013, a 67,000 square foot expansion, including a glycol cooling system containg 1,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The system is not connected to the existing system, and is separately located.\n\n\n\nC. Summary of Worst-case Scenarios\n\n1. Worst-Case\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility involves the release of 16,176 pounds of ammonia over a 10-min period at a release rate of 161.8 pounds per minute due to over-filling high pressure receiver during a pump down.\n\n\n\nThe worst-cases scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n- JM Smuckers of Scottsville KY has policies to enforce only that competent personnel work on the system and has the power to remove any offending employee and/or contractor from the companies payroll and or contracts.\n\n\n\n-The system was designed using standard practices and is maintained by rigid company standards.\n\n\n\n-The maintenance program includes a mechanical integrity audit system.\n\n\n\n-The maintenance program includes a shift monitoring procedure of the refrigeration system by fully trained personnel.\n\n\n\n-Low level controls, sensors for ammonia monitoring, and maintaining a safe ammonia liquid supply to the vessels acts as active mitigation before the release poses a threat to offsite receptors.\n\n\n\n-The"
