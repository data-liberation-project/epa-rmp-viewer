Description of Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies.\n\nJM Smuckers of Scottsville Kentucky recognizes management's responsibility in the protection of its employees, equipment, property, the community, and environment.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish JM Smuckers of Scottsville KY's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes government mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents.  The objectives of JM Smuckers of Scottsville Kentucky Safety Program are to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with JM Smuckers of Scottsville Kentucky Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program.  These programs are designated to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68).  JM Smuckers of Scottsville Kentucky Safety Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic accidents.  As a whole these programs are designed to prevent accidental"

Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates an uncrustables plant at 1070 Smith Grove Road, Scottsville, Kentucky.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, in which to freeze their product for storage and distribution.  Due to the number of safety features put in place to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the environment and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system would pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\n\n\nThe facility completed, in 2013, a 67,000 square foot expansion, including a glycol cooling system containg 1,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The system is not connected to the existing system, and is separately located.\n\n\n\nC. Summary of Worst-case Scenarios\n\n1. Worst-Case\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility involves the release of 16,176 pounds of ammonia over a 10-min period at a release rate of 161.8 pounds per minute due to over-filling high pressure receiver during a pump down.\n\n\n\nThe worst-cases scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n- JM Smuckers of Scottsville KY has policies to enforce only that competent personnel work on the system and has the power to remove any offending employee and/or contractor from the companies payroll and or contracts.\n\n\n\n-The system was designed using standard practices and is maintained by rigid company standards.\n\n\n\n-The maintenance program includes a mechanical integrity audit system.\n\n\n\n-The maintenance program includes a shift monitoring procedure of the refrigeration system by fully trained personnel.\n\n\n\n-Low level controls, sensors for ammonia monitoring, and maintaining a safe ammonia liquid supply to the vessels acts as active mitigation before the release poses a threat to offsite receptors.\n\n\n\n-The"

Description of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n1. Employee Participation:\n\nThis program ensures that the employees are involved in establishing and implementing the prevention program.  Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that the employees have complete access to the program on company property.  Regularly scheduled meetings are held to discuss any concerns.\n\n\n\n2.

Process Hazards Analysis:\n\nA formal analysis using the What-If/Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards.  For each Management of Change and at regularly scheduled intervals, a Process Hazard Analysis will be conducted and the corporate review team will review its recommendations.\n\n\n\n4. Operating Procedures:\n\nWritten operating procedures have been developed that describes the steps to be followed to operate the refrigeration system safely.  Every Management of Change and any operation involving the refrigeration system that was not previously identified will have an operating procedure developed and implemented for the actions required.\n\n\n\n5. Training\n\nA training schedule has been established and implemented which ensures that all employees that understand their responsibility during an emergency situation, whether its evacuation the building, responding to a release, or various other responsibilities during and after an ammonia release.  Additional training schedules have been established and implemented for the operators of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n6.
