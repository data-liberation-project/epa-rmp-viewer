      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nThe China Draw Gas Delivery Point is a newly constructed facility in an area that has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe China Draw Gas Delivery Point Description of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled: The China Draw Gas Delivery Point is a storage and sales facility located in Culberson County, Texas. The plant is designed to remove any liquids from the incoming natural gas stream, store NGLs on location in pressurized storage tank, to be transported by truck. The gas exits the facility to a metering skid for sales.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\n\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants. Written programs and procedures cover all critical equipment and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe facility has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site and no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe China Draw Gas Delivery Point Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Eddy County Emergency Management Coordinators. The Emergency Response Plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nNo changes to the safety program are currently planned."
