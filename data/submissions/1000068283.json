NGL and natural gas are the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) - regulated flammable substances that are present at the MA Williams #1.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE\n\nANKOR is committed to worker protection and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility. It is standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control / mitigate the release.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nMA Williams #1 is an oil and gas production facility that includes a natural gas processing facility.  The facility is located in a rural area of Union Parish, Louisiana. The facility is designed to produced oil and gas and then process the natural gas to extract natural gas liquid products.\n\n\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the MA Williams #1 because the facility handles and stores a NFPA 4 flammable mixture of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, iso-pentane and hexanes plus in excess of threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the MA Williams #1. The processes in the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation.  The facility is not normally manned so it is not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  There are potential offsite receptors, so the facility is classified as an RMP Program 2 facility.\n\n\n\n"
