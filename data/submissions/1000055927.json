The City developed and implemented the City's Process Safety Management/ Risk Management Prevention Program that provides a systematic approach to employee involvement, safety awareness and program assessment.\r\n\r\nPlant Description:\r\nThe Alvarado Water Treatment Plant was built in the early 1950's and became an architecture center piece of the community due to its beauty and mission style design. The Alvarado Water Treatment Plant has a maximum water treatment capacity of 200-million gallons per day (mgd). The facility is located on a mesa on relatively flat terrain bounded by the Lake Murray Reservoir to the north, and by residential areas in other directions bordering the City of La Mesa.  There is elevated terrain across the reservoir, and downward-sloping terrain to the south.\r\n\r\nAlvarado Water Treatment Plant uses a combined form of chlorine to disinfect water, making it suitable for use in the City of San Diego's drinking water distribution system and for sale to other agencies. The chlorine is received in one-ton pressurized liquid cylinders at the Chlorine Storage Room in the Raw Water Chemical Building.\r\n\r\nCommitment:\r\nThe Alvarado Water Treatment Plant has a well trained and committed operations and maintenance staff with a record of over 50 years of using chlorine safely.  To support the efforts of continued safe handling and use of chlorine at the Alvarado Water Treatment Plant, senior management has committed to the development of a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program under the guidelines of State and Federal mandates which has involved complete engineering reviews of the chlorine feed system and design certification.  The Alvarado Water Treatment Plant periodically review the RMP program and look for ways to improve safe"

The Risk Management Prevention is in fulfillment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR PART 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and the California Code of Regulations Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 - California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The Process Safety Management Program is in fulfillment of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's (OSHA) 1910.119, as well as Cal/OSHA's California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials.\r\n \r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\r\nIn accordance with 40 CFR PART 68, Subpart D, \"worst-case\" release scenarios and alternative scenarios are required to be completed to determine the distance to endpoint (e.g., under worst-case weather, the substance could travel X distance before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public).  \r\n\r\nOn April 9, 2004, EPA revised the RMP rule to remove the requirement that facilities include a brief description of off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative releases as par of the Executive Summary. This information has been removed to address security concerns.\r\n\r\nSafety Elements:\r\nSafety elements include administrative controls, engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE).  \r\n\r\nAdministrative elements may include but are not limited to:\r\n- Standard operations\r\n- Maintenance procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Record Keeping\r\n\r\nEngineering controls may include but are not limited to:\r\n- Facility alarms\r\n- Isolation Valves\r\n- Chlorine Scrubbers\r\n\r\nPPE controls may include but are not limited to:\r\n- Self Contained Breathing Apparatus \r\n- Chemical Protective Overalls\r\n- Safety Goggles\r\n\r\nSeveral administrative and engineering controls are installed on the chlorine process system to enhance the facility's emerg"

They consist of: \r\n\r\n1)\tChlorine leak detection sensors installed in both the chlorine cylinder storage room and chlorine feeder room which activate alarms in the plant when low-levels of chlorine are detected; \r\n\r\n2)\tThe Plant Control System collects these data, making the information immediately available to the Plant staff, enabling them to assess and respond to the release from several locations within the Plant; \r\n\r\n3)\tAn automatic chlorine shut-off system is installed to minimize the volume of a chlorine release by securing the chlorine at the cylinders; \r\n\r\n4)\tThe chlorine storage room was constructed as a \"containment facility\" to eliminate the free discharge of chlorine to the atmosphere. A critical component of this system is the \"scrubber\", which is capable, in the event of a release, of neutralizing 2,000 pounds of chlorine. This \"scrubber\" is activated by data acquired by the leak sensors, and may be initiated manually by Plant staff; \r\n\r\n5)\tSeveral safe-work-practices for the operations and maintenance sections are in place in conjunction with other safety programs to ensure employees work and respond safely.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response:\r\nThe Alvarado Water Treatment Plant, in conjunction with the Water Department Emergency Management Coordinator, have developed and tested a Chlorine Emergency Response Plan. The Emergency Response Plan was developed to support the Water Plant Operator in the event a chlorine release occurs and additional resources are needed to mitigate the situation. The San Diego Fire Department, Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team is dedicated to respond to our water plants if we have an incident.
