              "Description": "Crude Butadiene Storage / Distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nACT receives Crude Butadiene via pipeline, tank car, barges, and ships and it is stored in dedicated Sphere 697, which has a storage capacity of 40968 barrels.  Crude Butadiene can also be stored in Tank 1671 when converted to ?crude service?.  Crude Butadiene is shipped offsite via pipeline.  On occasion, ACT will receive tank cars that contain ST-04 Tank Bottoms, 1,3-Butadiene (Stabilized), Mixed Butylenes, and Crude Isoprene, which are flammable mixtures that contain regulated chemicals.  These cars are offloaded and sent into Sphere 697 where it is mixed with Crude Butadiene and shipped out via pipeline as Crude Butadiene product.  Therefore, for purposes of RMP applicability the storage and handling of these flammable mixtures are considered part of ACT?s Crude Butadiene process.",

In business at the same location since 1977, the company is a quality bulk storage/distribution facility for LPG-like chemicals.  Butadiene is shipped to companies around the United States, who in turn use the chemical to produce products such as tires, automotive parts, roofing materials, wire and cable coating, etc.  Propylene, which is shipped to companies in Texas, is a key ingredient used to produce plastic and rubber products.\n\n\n\nACT is a storage and shipping/receiving facility.  The chemicals typically stored or handled onsite on a day to day basis exceeding ARP threshold quantities include 1,3-Butadiene, Crude Butadiene, Chemical Grade Propylene, and Dilute Propylene.  ACT occasionally handles the following chemicals onsite that exceed ARP threshold quantities: Isobutylene (2-Methylpropene); 1,3-Butadiene (Stabilized); ST-04 Bottoms; Mixed Butylenes; and Crude Isoprene (aka Dilute Isoprene or Isoprene Concentrate).   Crude Butadiene, Dilute Propylene, 1,3- Butadiene (Stabilized), ST-04 Bottoms, Mixed Butylenes, and Crude Isoprene are flammable mixtures.  Crude Butadiene contains four regulated subst"

      "SummaryText": "ances (1,3-Butadiene, Butane, Butylene, and 2-Methylpropene); Dilute Propylene contains three regulated substances (Butane, Propane, and Propylene); 1,3-Butadiene (Stabilized) contains four regulated substances (1,3-Butadiene, 2-butene, 1-butene, and Butane); ST-04 Bottoms contains two regulated substances (1,3-Butadiene and Propylene); Mixed Butylenes contains six regulated substances (Butane, 1-Butane, 2-Butane-cis, Isobutane, Isobutylene, and 2-Butene (E)); and Crude Isoprene contains three regulated substances (Isoprene, 1,3-Pentadiene and n-Pentane). Chemicals are received via ship, barge, tank car, tank truck or pipeline and transferred to commerce via ship, barge, tank car, tank truck or pipeline.\n\n\n\n1,3-Butadiene, Crude Butadiene, Dilute Propylene, and Chemical Grade Propylene are stored in excess of threshold quantities and are therefore subject to the ARP Program.  Isobutylene in quantities exceeding the threshold is occasionally off-loaded directly from ships to tank cars. 1,3-Butadiene (Stabilized); ST-04 Bottoms; Mixed Butylenes; and Crude Isoprene in quantities exceeding the threshold may be occasionally unloaded from tank cars into the Crude Butadiene storage unit (Sphere 697) and transferred out via pipeline as a Crude Butadiene mixture.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because some processes at the plant meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Intercontinental Terminals Company has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) at the Anchorage Chemical Terminal that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program and this summary describes OIMS.  Further, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the ri"

Examples of associate participation ranges from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Associates have access to all information generated from HAZOPs and Site Risk Assessments.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives underway that address process safety and associate safety issues via the ACT Safety Committee which is comprised of site personnel and selected contractors.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The ACT Terminal Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the OIMS documentation to help associates locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has identified operating envelopes, i.e., documented safety related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained pe"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as form evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident "

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all associates involved in operating a process.  New associates receive basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (i.e., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations personnel periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site safety rules; and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) safety orientation; (2) information about safety and heath hazards; (3) emergency response plan requirements; and (4) saf"

On August 12, 2013, 1,3- Butadiene was released to the atmosphere from the vacuum breaker on Tank 1670 due to a blockage in the remote sensing tubing which prevented the necessary pressure to keep the vacuum breaker closed.  The release started at approximately 1400 hours and ended at 1720 hours.  The release event lasted approximately 200 minutes.  It is estimated that 8,466 pounds of 1,3 Butadiene was released based on the tank inventory net loss calculation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.
