The manufacturing plant currently houses both the administrative offices and the plant manufacturing operations. \n\n\n\nA 30,000 gallon liquefied petroleum LP gas tank is located off the southwest corner of the manufacturing plant. LP gas (propane/butane mixture) is used at the facility as a propellant for aerosol paints.
