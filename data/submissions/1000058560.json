The RMP includes descriptions of the methods and procedures adopted at the site to prevent possible accidents related to unintentional chemical releases.  The Austin Powder Company has developed this RMP  because the facility stores nitric acid (98% or greater concentration) above the established threshold quantity.  This is the first RMP filed for the Austin Powder Company; it reflects dates of current PSM activities.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY:\n\n\n\nThe Austin Powder Company participates in multiple safety programs that focus on prevention of explosions and fires, along with releases of regulated chemicals from the Nitric Acid Recovery Process.  This is achieved through the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and the RMP.  The PSM Program and RMP provide a basis of operating practices, procedures, and documentation that allow for the safe operation of the facility.\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n\n\nThe Austin Powder Company PETN facility is located in McArthur, Ohio.  The facility is designed to produce high concentrated nitric acid (98% or greater concentration) using PETN excess nitric acid (80% concentration), fresh weak nitric acid (60% concentration), and acidic recycle water.  The facility consists of the following main stages:\n\n\n\n1. Decomposer system for stabilization of PETN excess nitric acid\n\n2. Nitric acid concentration systems\n\n3. Bleaching system for concentrated nitric acid\n\n4. Sulfuric acid concentration \n\n5. Vacuum system\n\n6. Absorption system\n\n\n\nThe 80% nitric acid, acidic recycle water, and 60% nitric acid recovered from the absorption system are fed to the decomposer system.  There, nitric acids are mixed with hot recycled sulfuric acid from the sulfuric acid concentration system.  Heat fro"

      "SummaryText": "m the system decomposes the organic compounds to nitrous effluent gases.  Evaporated nitric acid vapor and a sulfuric/nitric acid mixture are fed to the nitric acid concentration system where concentrated nitric acid is produced.  The bleaching system removes the nitrous content from the produced concentrated nitric acid.  Sulfuric acid takes the water from the nitric acid and flows to the sulfuric acid concentration system, where it is re-concentrated at vacuum conditions.  Afterwards, the re-concentrated sulfuric acid is used again in the decomposer system.  The effluent gases generated by the process are treated in the NOx absorption unit where weak nitric acid is recovered from the nitrous content of the effluent gases.  Any weak nitric acid that is generated from the process is fed to the weak nitric acid tanks, and subsequently fed back (along with fresh weak nitric acid) to the decomposer system. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nListed below are accidental release prevention and safety programs that the Austin Powder Company has implemented to prevent accidental releases of Nitric Acid:\n\n- Process Safety Management (PSM) Program\n\n- Facility Design Standards\n\n- Safety Instrumented System\n\n- Facility Monitoring System\n\n- Relief Devices\n\n- Safe Operating Procedures\n\n- Management of Change Program\n\n- Pre-Start Up Safety Review Program\n\n- Employee Training\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nDue to this being a newly constructed facility and operation, there has not been any releases of nitric acid within the past 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or environmental damage.  This is the only process, due to the quantity of nitric acid, that is subject to the RMP requirements. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Austin Powder Company has developed its own Emergency Response Program (ERP) for the facility.  The ERP includes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that "

Austin Powder Company personnel developed and implemented an EAP that includes procedures on how to respond and evacuate in the event of a nitric acid release, fire, or other chemical release.  This program has been discussed with the Vinton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Zaleski Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe Austin Powder Company currently has no planned changes to improve safety. \n\n"
