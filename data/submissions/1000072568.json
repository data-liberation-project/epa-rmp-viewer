Schreiber sells its products - which include\r\ncream cheese, natural cheese, process cheese and yogurt - to leading retailers, restaurants,\r\ndistributors and food manufacturers around the world. Schreiber has more than 30 manufacturing\r\nand distribution facilities globally in the United States, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic,\r\nFrance, Germany, India, Mexico, Portugal and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe SFI - Clinton Plant employs approximately 227 people. The SFI plant uses anhydrous\r\nammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage as well as for cooling of manufacturing process\r\nlines. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk\r\nManagement of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM)\r\nregulations, SFI has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees\r\nand the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility\r\ncompleted an initial process hazards analyses (PHAs) for ammonia using the industry standard\r\nWhat-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration.\r\nThe most recent PHA revalidations were completed in 2017 using the HAZOP methodology which includes all situations evaluated in the\r\nIIAR's What-If?/Checklist Analysis. The original and revalidation PHAs were completed using\r\ntechnical and operations staff from the Clinton Plant as well as experienced facilitators. The\r\nPHAs reviewed operational, human factors, and facility siting issues relative to the design of the\r\nrefrigeration system, and recommendations were made, as appropriate, to address these concerns.\r\n\r\nSFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia\r\nand measures that can be used to reduce employee"

The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the\r\nammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes\r\n(MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such\r\nas safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who\r\nmay be hired to work on the system. Finally, SFI has undertaken a rigorous approach to PSM\r\ncompliance auditing. Findings from the audits are reported to the facility, which then must correct\r\nthe findings and provide written documentation of resolution of the findings to SFI's Director Safety.\r\n\r\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Plant's emergency response plan and places\r\nspecial emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of\r\nemergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\r\nMany of SFI's refrigeration and maintenance personnel have completed 24-hour HAZWOPER\r\nHAZMAT technician level training program. This training includes topics such as classification\r\nsystems and hazards identification; ammonia spill control and containment; respiratory protection; air\r\nmonitoring instrumentation; proper personal protective equipment; medical monitoring; and proper\r\ntermination procedures for emergency response activities. The facility conducts annual\r\nHAZWOPER refresher training to keep employees current and comfortable with their responsibilities\r\nunder the plan using classroom discussion and response to mock emergency scenarios. The facility\r\nalso conducts quarterly drills during which the emergency response team practices implementation\r\nof the incident command system to respond to mock emergency situations.\r\n\r\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of\r\nthe accidental release of the largest vessel in th"
