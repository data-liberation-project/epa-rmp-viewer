The plant processes vegetable and animal oils that provide consumers with high-quality margarine, spreads, cooking oil and lard products. This facility is not currently subject to the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  With the completed 2004 facility expansion the maximum intended inventory of ammonia is now 18,500 lbs and requires maintenance of the Program Level 3 Risk Management Plan along with a Process Safety Management plan.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan submission to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Ventura Foods, LLC, Albert Lea, MN.\n\nFacility Snapshot\nThis facility, was constructed in 1965, was owned and operated by Miami Margarine and Holsum Foods prior to VenturaA?s acquisition of the plant in 1997.  The plant produces over 450 million pounds of product annually.\n\nImpact on the community\nA?    Ventura employs 185 area residents at a combined annual salary of approximately $4 million.\nA?    Ventura supports Albert Lea and the state of Minnesota with state and local taxes.\nA?    The facility purchases more than $1,000,000 million of local services; electricity, natural gas, water, wastewater treatment, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nEmployee snapshot\nVentura employees are involved in community activities.

Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the general public.\n\nTo achieve its goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\nA?    Keeping a knowledgeable and highly trained and motivated employee group\nA?    A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\nA?    Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate\nA?    Excellence in safety programs and practices; a superior safety and accident record\nA?    Preparation and training for emergency response and mitigation\n\nThe plant has a written Emergency Response Plan in effect.  Ventura Foods, LLC. is committed to responding to and mitigating any accidental releases to minimize the impact to employees, the community, and environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the Emergency Response Agencies ( Albert Lea Fire Department & County LEPC)and the plant has interacted with possible responding agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the plant.  Employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and in possible response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.

The threshold limit for regulatory implementation of program is 10,000 lbs of ammonia.  With the planned expansion of facility and installation of new refrigeration equipment, Ventura estimates that they will increase ammonia inventory to a level at or below 18,500 well below the maximum system capacity of 21,191 pounds, if components were fully flooded.  \n\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst-case and alternate release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility Ammonia Anhydrous is the only regulated hazardous substance.  \n\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst-case event, unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.   It should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst-case scenario is extremely low. \n \nAlternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic and flammable substance, which are more likely events, must also be presented.  More likely release events tend to concentrate in areas such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses. Significantly lower quantities are involved and operator intervention would tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\nThe largest vessel, located indoors, has a maximum capacity of 10,300 pounds.  The worst case scenario assumes that this entire amount would release in 10.5 minutes, as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank.

Based on the 2000 census population data, obtained from LandView 6 from the US Census Bureau, potentially 2,987 people could be affected by a release of this magnitude. The worst-case scenario would reach offsite endpoints, including public and environmental receptors. \n\nAlternate Release Toxics - Ammonia\nThis alternate release scenario consists of a pipe leak, which discharges 1,300 pounds of ammonia 21.67 lbs/min over 60 minutes prior to the operator stopping the leak.  Under neutral weather conditions, Class F atmospheric conditions and a wind speed of 3 m/s, the maximum distance to the toxic end point of 0.14 mg/l is 0.10 mile radius. Based on the 2000 census population data, obtained from LandView 6 from the US Census Bureau, this scenario would reach offsite endpoints and would not affect public and environmental receptors.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe ammonia refrigeration at this plant is currently subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.
