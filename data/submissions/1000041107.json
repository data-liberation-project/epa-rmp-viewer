      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\r\nThe Service Cold Storage, Stevens Point facility, refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant. Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Service Cold Storage to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. \r\n\r\nSafety at our facility is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel, are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) and an Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \r\n\r\n2. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Service Cold Storage, Stevens Point facility, is a refrigerated warehouse.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, and the maximum intended inventory of this covered process chemical is 16,800 pounds. \r\n\r\n3.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nService Cold Storage complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards.\r\n\r\nService Cold Storage's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and proce"

      "SummaryText": "dures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration systems include employee participation, Process Safety Information (PSI), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), training, contractor safety, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR), mechanical integrity, Management of Change (MOC), hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\r\n\r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA). Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system. This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia. Startup, shutdown, and any system adjustments are handled by these qualified persons. \r\n\r\n4.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facility has not had a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia within the last five years.  The facility opened on 6 June 2014.\r\n\r\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nService Cold Storage has a written Emergency Action Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.

In addition, all of the recommendations from the initial PHA will be addressed in a timely manner which will improve the safety and practice of the Service Cold Storage facility."
