In addition, the facility has established initial and refresher training requirements for ammonia refrigeration operators and mechanics as well as awareness training for all facility employees.\n\nAll facility employees are trained on the hazards of ammonia and how to recognize and report accidental releases. They are also trained on evacuation procedures, where to go and what to do once they have evacuated the building. High Track, LLC has established and trained an emergency response team to handle small leaks as well as major releases of ammonia. Emergency response efforts are coordinated with the McFarland Fire and Police Departments and the Dane County LEPC. Facility personnel will evaluate and respond to all ammonia releases that are within their training, capability and resources. If facility personnel cannot safely control and mitigate the release, or the incident would affect the public or the environment, the facility will notify the McFarland Police and Fire Department for assistance.\n\nSince this is a new facility, there is no accident history to report. Through regular audits, training, maintenance, and system testing and inspection programs, High Track, LLC intends to establish a history of safe operation."

      "SummaryText": "High Track, LLC is a newly constructed cold storage warehouse located at 4704 Terminal Drive in McFarland, WI. High Track, LLC plans to start serving customers by the end of December, 2004. The majority of the cold storage rooms will be freezers\n\nAt our facility, anhydrous ammonia (cas #7664-41-7) is used as a refrigerant to maintain the desired air temperatures of our freezers, cooler rooms, and docks. Designed as a closed-loop, two-stage compression system, liquid ammonia is pumped to each of the room air-cooling evaporators from one of the two pump receivers. A mix of ammonia liquid and vapor returns to the pump receivers where the liquid is separated from the vapor. Ammonia vapor is pulled from the pump receivers, compressed, and sent to rooftop condensers where it is cooled and condensed to a liquid to be used again by the evaporators. The maximum high-side system operating pressure is 175 psig but the highest pressure that the system normally operates at ranges between 125 to 150 psig. The maximum quantity of ammonia on-site is 30,000 lbs.\n\nMany safety features have been incorporated into the design and installation of the ammonia refrigeration system to protect the system and its components from a catastrophic failure and release of ammonia and to minimize the impact should an incident occur. Notable safety design features include:\n\n1.\tSystem operation and monitoring by a programmable logic controller (PLC). The PLC controls the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system including loading and unloading compressors to handle the load demands of the system, sequencing condenser fans and water pumps to maintain a safe high-side operating pressure and controlling the cooling and defrost cycles of area evaporators to maintain room temperatures. The PLC also monitors the operating parameters of the system such as pressures, temperatures, and liquid levels and will either initiate an alarm or shut down the system (depending on the type of alarm) when any of the p"
