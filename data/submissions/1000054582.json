      "SummaryText": "The aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the facility is comprised of two storage tanks, pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer in which the aqueous ammonia is atomized.  The tanks have a capacity of 12,000 gallons, each, and will have working capacities of 10,000 gallons, each.  When both tanks are full, Plant 2/2A will have a maximum combined capacity of 53,000 pounds of ammonia onsite.  This capacity exceeds the toxic substances threshold of 20,000 pounds for aqueous ammonia with a concentration of greater than 20 percent.  The tanks are surrounded by a single dike that is capable of containing the entire contents of both storage tanks in case of a catastrophic equipment failure.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Plant 2/2A is an aqueous ammonia storage tank failure and with the full volume of aqueous ammonia released at one time.  An offsite consequence analysis was conducted using the EPA RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (OAC) (2009).  The impact distance from a worst-case release extends beyond the facility property boundary but does not affect any public or environmental receptors therefore this facility falls under RMP Program Level 1.\n\n\n\nTo prevent future potential ammonia accidents with offsite impacts, ML&P has established the following practices:\n\n?    The facility utilizes an extensive, interconnected alarm system to monitor the ammonia storage tanks;\n\n?    Access to the site is restricted to authorized personnel via guard gates;\n\n?    Facility personnel are provided training addressing safe work practices and the proper procedures to be followed should a leak or spill occur;\n\n?    Spills from the storage tanks will be contained within the diked area, minimizing the impact distance; and\n\n?    Tanks are routinely inspected to ensure integrity.\n\n \n\n"
