As a demonstration of that commitment, the Courtland Mill has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all it's employees and operations. The Environmental Policy includes the following:\n\n\"The Courtland Mill strives to minimize the environmental impacts of all our operations, processes, and products in a manner responsive to the needs of our shareholders, customers, employees, the communities in which we operate, and the public.\" \n\nThe Workplace Health and Safety Policy further includes:\n\n\"The protection of our people and property as well as the prevention of all accidents, injuries, and illnesses, are core values at Champion International Corporation. As such, they are also key considerations in everything we do. Our success depends greatly on a work environment that is safe and healthy for all employees, visitors, contractors, and the residents of the communities in which we operate.\"  \n\nChampion believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. \n\nChampion and the Courtland Mill have put in place an organizational structure to demonstrate its commitment to that belief.

One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that  manages the risks of manufacturing, handling, storing and processing hazardous chemicals  and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs\" (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Courtland Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program.\nThe risk management program at Courtland Mill consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental \n    releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of \n    substances regulated by the RMP rule  - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold\n    quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from \n    covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the Courtland Mill helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the overall mill safety program. In fact, the Courtland mill has a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against the release of a hazardous substance. The most important part of Champion'"

      "SummaryText": "s RMP compliance philosophy has been the elimination or reduction of the  hazardous substances covered under this regulation. \n\nThe Courtland Mill limits the use of hazardous substances wherever possible by first considering less hazardous alternatives.  As demonstration of this, three regulated chemical processes have already been eliminated from the mill and there are plans to eliminate another in 1999. When a hazardous substance must be used, the Courtland Mill considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.   \n\nWhen a hazardous substance must be used, the equipment is designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are strictly adhered to in the design, construction, maintenance and operation of the equipment. \n\nThe Courtland Mill limits damage from a release, if it occurs.  Employees assigned to HAZMAT teams respond to an accidental release.  In addition, the Courtland Mill works with appropriate local, state, and federal agencies and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur due to a release.\n\nThe safety program at the Courtland Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program  that are required by the RMP rule. It does not  explain all phases of the mills safety program many of which enhance the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program.  \n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Courtland Mill is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

      "SummaryText": "SHA's Process Safety Management (CFR 1910.119) This regulation requires controls that will eliminate or reduce the impact of a release.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards. It also includes a program to evaluate the impacts of process changes on safety.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Courtland Mill controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees, the public, and the environment.  The Courtland Mill provides training to response personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department. The Courtland mill maintains a Hazardous Materials Response team that is trained and equipped to respond to on-site chemical releases. Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Courtland Mill established a management system headed by the mill's Vice President - Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2   Champion International and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Courtland mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paper products.  As part of this manufacturing process, the Courtland Mill handles regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list.\n\nProcess                    Chlorine Dioxide System            \nProgram Level                three\nRegulated Substance            Chlorine Dioxide\nMaximum Process Quantity        51,000 Lb.\nLargest Single Vessel            25,000 Lb.\n\nProcess                    Chlorine 90 Ton Rail Car\nProgram Level                three\nRegulated Substance            Chlorine\nMaximum Process Quantity        720,000 Lb.\nLargest Single Vessel            180,000 Lb.\n\nProcess                    Water Treatment Chlorine\nProgram Level                three\nRegulated Substance            Chlorine\nMaximum Pr"

This system includes the two chlorine dioxide generators, storage tanks, and distribution piping.  It is considered one process because the components are interconnected. Each of these components may have had separate HAZOPs performed on them. However the elements of the prevention programs are the same. Therefore the decision was made to report it as one process covered by one prevention program. \n\nThe 90 ton rail car chlorine process consists of two completely separate and independent systems.  Each system has one rail car connected to it with a spare unattached car for standby.  Even though the Courtland Mill reports a total of 360 tons on site,  no more than 90 ton are connected to any single system.  These systems were both studied under one Process Hazard Analysis and the elements of the prevention programs are the same. Therefore the decision was made to report it as one process covered by one prevention program.\n\nThe Water Treatment and Water Intake chlorine processes are reported similarly.  There are 12 one ton cylinders stored at each site.  The Water Intake process never has more than two cylinders attached to any single system.  The Water Treatment process never has more than three cylinders attached at any time. One Process Hazard Analysis was done on all chlorine cylinder applications.  Special considerations were given to the differences in the sites and the environment.  Due to the distance between the locations of these two processes they have been reported as two separate processes each with it's own prevention program.      \n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Courtland Mill performed an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of"

The RMP regulations require  an evaluation of both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.   In accordance with the RMP requirements, a worst case release analysis was conducted and the results are reported in this document.  The Courtland Mill has researched it's accident history and found that such a release has never occurred at the mill in over 20 years of operation.   \n\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated are intended to represent releases that might occur and were based on our experience at this and  other mills.   The alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Courtland's and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  While Champion believes that such releases are unlikely to occur at our mill, nevertheless we have evaluated the offsite impact of the releases in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Courtland Mill has conducted the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario using the EPA's guidance document which includes look-up tables that were developed to provide the highest estimate of the possible offsite consequences of such releases. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The tables were developed to provide information on the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for a chemical of concern.

The Courtland Mill believes such data can be valuable to local emergency planning agencies for alternative release scenarios and therefore has elected to conduct air quality modeling to characterize offsite impacts due to alternative release scenarios. A model is a mathematical estimate of the way a chemical plume moves and reacts after it is released to the air. The air quality model provides more realistic and detailed information on estimated plume dimensions, concentration of pollutants by downwind distance, time of travel and the location of the plume at discreet time intervals. These elements of data have been provided to Lawrence County Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to assist them in planning for any actions that should be taken if, the unlikely event of an accident should occur.\n \nChampion selected two models to evaluate off-site impacts:  an EPA approved screening model known as SCREEN3 and TRACE. TRACE is a comprehensive hazard assessment software package for analyzing the impact of toxic, flammable and explosive chemical releases in the atmosphere.  TRACE can simulate toxic chemical releases resulting from tank failures and pipe leaks for gases that are heavier than air or for neutrally buoyant gasses.  TRACE has the capability to model ground level or elevated releases in the form of dense clouds or buoyant plumes. SCREEN3 was used to simulate the release of chlorine dioxide due to a loss of the scrubber control system on the chlorine dioxide generators. TRACE was used to evaluate the release of chlorine dioxide due to a leak in a chlorine dioxide transfer pipe.  The same model was also used to evaluate the potential off-site impact of chlorine due to a leak in a valve or line connected to a 1 ton chlorine storage cylinder.\n\nTypical information entered into the model to characterize a chemical release is:\n\n* Physical State:  gas, liquid, aerosol,"

Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\nC.  Operating Procedures.  The Courtland Mill operators, process engineers, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures or training guides  are used to (1) train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\nThe Courtland Mill personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.

The Courtland Mill maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, the public or the environment.  This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.  \n\nF.  Management of Change.  The Courtland Mill management of change program requires that a team evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to ensure that the change does not affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form.
