      "SummaryText": "The Eunice Natural Gas Processing Plant (Eunice Plant or Facility) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds) in the processing and storage of natural gas.  The Facility stores natural gas liquids (NGL) or raw feed, propane, n-butane, isopentane, and isobutane in a variety of storage vessels. The Facility does not store any toxic substances above threshold quantities.  This Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the Facility. Therefore, the Eunice Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \r\n\r\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Eunice Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \r\n\r\nThe Eunice Plant employs 32 full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the facility. \r\n\r\nCrosstex Processing Services, LLC (Crosstex) last submitted an RMP to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in June 2009 for the Eunice Plant.  Crosstex is in the process of adding amine treatment and fractionation to the Facility, which required revisions to the RMP.  The"

      "SummaryText": "following information also serves as the 5-year RMP update for the Eunice Plant.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Plant maintains a policy of safe flammable material handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with material transfer and storage activities, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.   \r\n\r\nThe Eunice Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a flammable material release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Plant processes and stores NGL, and NGL derivatives in various temporary and permanent aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves.  NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture above 1 percent include ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and pentane.  The maximum inventory of NGL at the Facility at any given time is 418,400 gallons (gal) (1,936,660 lbs), in seven tanks.  The largest NGL tank is 74,030 gal (342,650 lbs).  \r\n\r\nThe NGL is further treated using cryogenic and fractionation process, resulting in the following RMP-regulated products stored at the Facility prior to shipment off-site: \r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\tPropane, a flammable mixture containing propane, ethane, n-butane and isobutane, is stored in 11 tanks, one of which is refrigerated.  The maximum inventory of propane at the Facility at any given time is 904,900 gal (4,452,630 lbs).  The largest propane tank is 83,830 gal (412,470 lbs).  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tN-butane, a flammable mixture containing n-butane and isobutane, is stored in 8 tanks.  The maximum inventory of n-butane at the Facility at any given time is 480,960 gal (2,321,700 lbs).  The largest n-butane tank is 78,420 gal (378,550 lbs).  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tIsobutan"

      "SummaryText": "e, a flammable mixture containing isobutene, n-butane, and propane, is stored in 5 tanks.  The maximum inventory of isobutane at the Facility at any given time is 387,450 gal (1,819,230 lbs).  The largest isobutane tank is 77,730 gal (364,980 lbs).  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tIsopentane is stored in one 63,490 gal (328,330 lb) tank.  This also represents the maximum inventory of isopentane at the Facility at any given time.\r\n\r\nThe Facility also stores natural gasoline and natural gas condensate in 5 storage vessels, both of which are flammable mixtures derived from the raw feed.  Both natural gasoline and natural gas condensate are not RMP-regulated because they are NFPA Class 3 flammable substances.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility also uses an amine treatment process.  The amine used at the Facility is not an RMP-regulated substance.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL and other RMP-regulated flammables. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the Prevention Program required under OSHA's PSM. The Eunice Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining\r\n\u00bf\tContractors\r\n\u00bf\tPre-startup Review\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permits\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Plant has had no accidental releases of flammable materials regulated under the RMP program that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to January 2013."

      "SummaryText": "EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM rule. The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPublic and emergency response agency notification procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tProper first aid and emergency medical treatment;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response measures;\r\n\u00bf\tProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \r\n\u00bf\tEmployee training; and\r\n\u00bf\tProgram review procedures.\r\n\r\nCrosstex maintains a corporate Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) that provides guidance for emergencies expected at all Crosstex facilities, including the Eunice Plant, as well as additional safety information. The Eunice Plant also maintains a site-specific Emergency Action Plan.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response with the Acadia Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Eunice Fire Department. For these reasons, the Eunice Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b), and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95.  \r\n\r\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility. Complete details on the Emergency Response Program required under the PSM Rules are included in the Eunice Plant's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.   \r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe Facility last completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in November 28, 2012 to assess potential areas to improve safety at the facility.  The anticipated completion date for all action items resulting from the most recent PHA is May 2013."
