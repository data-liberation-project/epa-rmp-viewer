Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nKentucky Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Louisville facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Larry Slauenwhite, Maintenance Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nKentucky Distribution Center is part of Kroger Dedicated Logistics Inc.  The facility is a  warehouse that  stores perishable and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to retail outlets.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 31,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Kentucky Distribution Center facility involves the release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the control pressure receiver (CPR-1).  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the receiver at any time.  The worst case endpoint distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n\t \tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the receiver; \n\t \tThe receiver i"

The endpoint distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief devices;\n\t \tThe system is operated at considerably lower pressures compared to the PSV's relief pressure setting;\n\t \tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\t \tThe facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the pressure relief devices; \n\t \tThe facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n\t \tThe facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate potential releases from any leak"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\t \tEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\t \tProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\t \tProcess Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist  Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations are resolved to improve facility safety. \n\n\t \tOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\t \tTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\t \tContractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n\t \tPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required  for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.

Any recommendations are resolved to improve the safety of the facility. \n\n\t \tCompliance Audits: There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.  Any recommendations from audits are resolved to improve the RM program. \n\nE.   Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one ammonia-related incident at the Kentucky Distribution Center within the last five years which has resulted in an onsite impact.  A release of ~80 lbs of ammonia occurred during an expansion project due to a contractor's failure to follow procedures.  The incident resulted in no significant off-site exposure and was investigeted using the Incident investigation procedures.  Steps have been taken to prevent recurrence of the event.\n\n\nF.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Kentucky Distribution Center facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Middletown Volunteer Fire Department.  The facility has cooperated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee to install a Community Alert Siren on facility property which can be used in the event of an ammonia release which may have off site impact.  Facility emergency plans reflect the siren's presence and use."
