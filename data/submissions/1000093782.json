This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. Boskovich Farms policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Boskovich Farms facility is listed as 711 Diaz Avenue, Oxnard, California 93030.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  For documenting purposes, the facility will report the \"maximum intended inventory\" as 27,870 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia. Refer to Process Safety Information section for related ammonia inventory calculations and information.\n\n\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nIn accordance with CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook (Compliance Workbook).\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled in accordance with applicable regulations.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Boskovich Farms has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it sho"

In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release include a well-designed relief system, alarms and shutoffs, gas detection, and an adequate venting system.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Boskovich Farms to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 27,870 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 500-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 requirements.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis [PHA]\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Training\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n- Compliance Audits\n\n- Incident Investigation\n\n- Employee Participation\n\n- Hot Work Permit\n\n- Contractors\n\n\n\nThe purpose of employee participation is improved safety for all employees.

It is reviewed with each new refrigeration employee and they acknowledge their awareness of PSM by signing the document.  If necessary, the PSM orientation is given in Spanish.  PSM awareness documents are available in both English and in Spanish.\n\n\n\nBoskovich Farms, Inc. involves operations or maintenance employees in meetings or discussions concerning the PSM policies and procedures.  In addition, several other PSM procedures are reviewed by or conducted with the involvement of at least one employee or a representative of the employees:\n\n- Process Safety Information is reviewed for accuracy and thoroughness.\n\n- Operating Procedures are developed with input from refrigeration employees. In addition, refrigeration employees check the written procedures to ensure they are accurate.\n\n- Training programs and needs for refresher training are reviewed with affected employees.

The operating procedures address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.\n\n\n\nTraining has been developed to help employees understand the nature and causes of problems arising from ammonia operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to their hazards.
