Safety is not something that can simply be dictated by management; in order to be effective all employees are encouraged and expected to play a role in the development and implementation of safety practices.\n\nAll management members are committed to playing an active role in improving and maintaining safety activities within the plant.\n\nFacility Overview\nDreyer\u00bfs is a manufacturer of ice cream.  Anhydrous ammonia is used throughout the facility as the primary source of refrigeration.  The plant including production areas, warehouse space and administrative offices is approximately 31,000 square feet.  Manufacturing activities continue 24 hours a day, five to seven days each week.  In total 60 employees are involved in manufacturing operations.  A sales division also operates out of the same location with another 20 employees.  Company delivery trucks are moving product out of the facility up to five days each week.\n\nWorst Case Release\nThe worst case scenaria assumes a catastrophic release of 6,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the high pressure receiver within 10 minutes.  Although the mitigating effects of a walled enclosure could have been used in the endpoint calculation, this was not done in the interest of generating the most conservative consequences.  RMPComp was used to perform the endpoint calculations and Landview  6 was used to determine the population in the affected area.\n\nAlternative Release\nFacility Name: Dreyer\u00bfs Grand Ice Cream, Salt Lake Operations\nThe alternative release scenario assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia from a broken \u00bd"

As in the worst case scenario, the mitigating effects of a walled enclosure were not factored into the endpoint calculations.\n\nRelease Prevention\nDreyer\u00bfs has a documented PSM program.  This program is not a static system.  The program is designed to be dynamic, changing with the facility as new processes or procedures are implemented.  Key to the program is the involvement of all employees in maintaining the effectiveness of the system.\n\nFive Year History\nThere have been no reportable ammonia releases in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe existing emergency response plan covers the following subjects:\n\u00bfEvacuation Procedures\n\u00bfNotification Procedures\n\u00bfAmmonia Release Procedures\n\u00bfFirst Response Team\n\u00bfTraining Procedures\n\nPlanned Changes\nThe company has implemented a comprehensive safety program.  This program consists of 46 specific subjects including, Training, Corrective Action, Safety Committee, Job Hazard Evaluation, Incident investigation, Hazard Abatement, Chemical Control & Hazard Communication, Control of Hazardous Energy, Process Safety Management, Emergency Response, Risk Management, Safety and Environmental Review. Each module details responsible parties, training required and documentation requirements."
