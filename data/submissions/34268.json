Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Uniqema Atlas Point facility has had one (1) accidental release of ethylene oxide and one (1) accidential release of propylene oxide from the covered processes in the last five (5) years of 440 pounds and 700 pounds, respectively. No one either onsite or offsite was injured during the event and evacuations were determined not to be required during the incidents. \n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Uniqema accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Emergency Response section, specified in 40 CFR 68.90 to 68.95.  \n\nUniqema maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that describes the site's emergency response program.  The local community emergency response organization, Hollaway Terrace Fire Department, has received a copy of the ICP and has included it in the community emergency response plan.  The ICP includes the following elements:\n\n- Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\n- Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures\n- Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nIn addition, the site's emergency response program, as included in the ICP, includes procedures for the use of the site's emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance.  The emergency response plan includes procedures to review and update the ICP to reflect changes at the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage tanks.  Uniqema trains all employees in the applicable procedures and informs them of changes at the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage tanks.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Impro"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Uniqema Atlas Point site uses ethylene oxide and propylene oxide as raw materials in the manufacture of various surface active agents (surfactants).  Surfactants are used in household, personal care and industrial applications.  It is Uniqema's policy to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.  Uniqema is in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program, 40 CFR Part 68. The 5-year RMP submission is being made in accordance with the requirements specified in 40 CFR 68.190(b)(1).\n\nThe Uniqema Atlas Point site conducts hazard analysis reviews prior to the design, construction and operation of any process unit.  Records are kept of each hazard review and the actions implemented as an outcome of the review are documented.  Detailed information relating to Uniqema's accidental release prevention program is provided in the Accidental Release Prevention Program section.\n\nThe Uniqema site maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that describes the emergency response program.  It is Uniqema's policy to respond in an efficient and effective manner to any emergency that occurs at the Uniqema Atlas Point site.  Uniqema personnel regularly prepare for emergencies by conducting emergency drills that have included the local fire department.  A group of Uniqema employees have been trained to act as emergency responders, incident commanders and duty managers.  Uniqema emergency personnel can be reached 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Uniqema Atlas Point site stores ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in quantities that exceed threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds, as defined in 40 CFR 68.115.  Both ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are listed as toxic substances under 40 CFR 68.130.  The Uniqema site does not store any"

The alternative release scenarios reviewed by Uniqema include the transfer and unloading of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide from a railcar to the onsite aboveground tanks.  The largest quantities of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide that are stored at the Uniqema site are in the respective storage tanks.  Written procedures limit the quantity stored in the on-site tanks and both storage tanks are located outside in a diked area.  An emergency spill retention area, or spill sump, is located south of the tanks and was designed to capture releases from a full railcar and both the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage tanks.\n\nThe Uniqema site has chosen to utilize EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and the RMP Comp program for obtaining the worst case release scenario.  Due to the complex nature of the properties of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, Uniqema utilized EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the RMP Comp program and the National Atmospheric Organization's ALOHA model for the alternative release scenarios for ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.   \n\nUniqema obtained public and environmental receptor data through Landview III & Landview V, desktop mapping programs sponsored by the EPA, US Bureau of Census, US Geological Society, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Transportation and Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Uniqema accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Prevention Program 3 specified in 40 CFR 68.65 to 68.87.

Some of the safety features of the system, also known as active mitigation systems, include the following:\n\n-  A remote emergency retention area or spill sump is located south of the storage tank area.  The spill sump was designed to contain releases from a railcar and both the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage tanks.  The size of the spill sump is approximately 25 feet by 60 feet, or 1500 square feet, with a depth of 12.5 feet, for a total volume of 18,750 cubic feet.\n\n-  A diked area surrounds the storage tank area and is approximately 65 feet long by 24 feet wide.\n\n-  A water deluge system was designed and installed based upon the National Fire Protection (NFPA) standards.\n\n-  A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) was installed to improve system monitoring and control.  This system monitors key parameters such as temperature and pressure and will automatically set the system to a safe state should an upset occur. A hardwired interlock system is in place to monitor and set to a safe state for critical conditions that are immediately threatening to human health.    \n\n-  Alarms are wired and controlled through the PLC and sound an audible alarm as well as a visual flag.  Alarms are used for only conditions that are not immediately threatening to human health.\n\n-  Emergency backup power for storage tank area lighting system and control components.\n\n-  A packed column scrubber was installed for emissions vented during unloading operations.  The scrubber was sized to remove emissions at a much higher than normal concentration and rate to insure that a potential upset condition would be controlled.\n\n-  A dispersion stack for the relief valve outlet was included to disperse emissions during an emergency release.  The stack insures that the concentr"
