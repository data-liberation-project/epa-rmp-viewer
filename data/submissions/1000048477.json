TOTAL - Cray Valley policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nTo manufacture these products TCV - Grand Junction uses a regulated raw material, 1,3-butadiene (Butadiene). Butadiene is regulated because its flammable properties are similar to propane.\n\n\n\nTCV - Grand Junction understands the hazards associated with the use of Butadiene and has an accidental release prevention plan in effect. This plan is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan. In its plan, OSHA details training requirements for employees and precautions to be taken in manufacturing and maintenance of equipment when using hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program of TCV - Grand Junction is based on recommendations of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), \"Industrial Emergency Preparedness\" by Robert Kelly, the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) and the American Petroleum Institution (API). The program contains procedures for contacting local, state and national response centers and for notifying areas that would be affected off site.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance.\n\nTCV - Grand Junction receives 1,3-butadiene, a regulated substance used at this facility, by various means. TCV - Grand Junction has the equipment and trained personnel to safely unload the material when it arrives.\n\nButadiene is stored in two stationary storage tanks and also uses in one process tank.\n\nNo butadiene is shipped from this site. Material received is used to make TCV- Grand Junction products.\n\n\n\n\n\n3) The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario, Includin"

      "SummaryText": "g Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distance for Each Reported Scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst case scenario - A release of 1,3-butadiene would occur due to the rupture of the largest storage vessels. The assumption would be that all of Butadiene contained in the tank would be released and the vapor cloud would find an ignition source.\n\n\n\nAlternative scenario -  A line failure while transferring 1,3-butadiene from rail car to storage tank would release the content of the hose and some materials from the rail car. Excess flow valves, emergency shutoff valves and standard unloading procedures would limit the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n4) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nTCV- Grand Junction complies with EPA Accidental Release Program and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Affected employees have been trained in release prevention and response.\n\n\n\n\n\n5) Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of butadiene that have affected an off-site receptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n6) The Emergency Response Program\n\nTCV- Grand Junction's Emergency Response Program is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, Robert B. Kelly's \"Industrial Emergency Preparedness\" and the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) \"Emergency Response Manual for NFPA 472\".\n\nThese plans have been coordinated with the Grand Junction Fire Department (GJFD) and the Mesa County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThe GJFD audits the facility for fire safety periodically.\n\n\n\n7) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility has remote and automatic shut-off valves. TCV- Grand Junction has excess flow check valves and pressure relief systems that are associated with the Butadiene system. This system is fully operational.\n\n"
