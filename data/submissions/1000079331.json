Dreisbach's safety and environmental policies are administered by senior staff including the President, who participates in quarterly inspections of each facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the safety and environmental programs with assistance from operations personnel.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nDreisbach's Richmond facility is located at 3151 Regatta Blvd., California approximately 0.2 miles south of the 580 freeway exit at Marina Bay Parkway.  The facility and the refrigeration system began operation in the early 1960s.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of Dreisbach is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 31,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold and freezer warehousing.  Typical operating conditions range from 0 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 130 psig on the high side of the system."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\r\n\r\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\r\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\r\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\r\n\r\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Dreisbach to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Dreisbach's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the syst"

      "SummaryText": "em to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room and Cold Storage Areas.  The ammonia detection system in the Engine Room has two setpoints: WARN - Alarm at computer system and page operators and ALARM - Engine room refrigeration equipment shutdown.  The Cold Storage Area ammonia detection system has a single setpoint which, if reached, will alert operators to the situation via the computer control system. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBased upon the Dreisbach Hazard Assessment Update Report (02/25/2019), there have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (February 2014 - February 2019.)\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n1. save lives;\r\n2. minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n3. protect the environment; and\r\n4. minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as needed to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nIn December 2016, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA consisted of a:\r\n\r\n1. Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\r\n2. series of safety checklists; and\r\n3. facility inspection.\r\n\r\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures."
