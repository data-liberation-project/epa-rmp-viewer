Polypro recently installed a new process to produce hydroxy propyl guar.\nThis new process will involve the use of propylene oxide which is both toxic and flammable.\n\nPolypro Inc. Has worked very close with Huntsman Chemical, the Georgia Environmental Protection \nDivision, the Dalton Fire Department and Midsouth Metal to insure that the system was installed properly\nand meets and complies with all local, state and federal safety and environmental regulations.  The new\nprocess consist of a tanker unloading system, storage tank, weight tank and a reactor.  The storage tank\nhas a storage capacity of 10,000 gallons, however, inventory controls and safety procedures allow no\nmore than 7,000 gallons of propylene oxide to be stored at any time.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY DEVICES\n\nThe following devices are used throughout the system to ensure a safe operation and quick response if\nan incident should occur:\n\nSTORAGE TANK AND TANKER UNLOADING AREA\n\n*  Concrete dikes and berms around both the tanker unloading station and the storage tank to contain any\n   accidental spills.\n*  The storage tank area is equipped with a foam system for vapor supression and fire protection should\n   an accidental spill occur.\n*  Both the storage tank and the tanker unloading headers are equipped with dry disconnect valves to \n   prevent spillage.\n*  The pump transfer system is equipped with an emergency shut off to ensure quick shut down should a\n    problem arise during the transfer from the tank truck to the storage tank.\n*  A nitrogen blanket of 5-10 psi will be maintained at all times on the storage tank.\n*  Nitrogen will be used to purge all lines after unloading.\n\nREACTOR AND REACTOR AREA\n\n*  The reactor will be pressurized (low pressure) and inspected for leaks on each and every Monday.\n*  The reactor is equipped with both high pressure and high "

All electrical equipment located within\n    the reactor area is rated for hazardous locations (explosion proof).  This eliminates any possible ignition\n    source should an accidental spill or vapor release occur.\n*  The reactor is also equipped with a computer system which will allow reactor activities to be monitored\n    from any computer screen in the plant.  Example:  Engineers office, plant managers office and General\n    managers office.\n*  The reactor area is also equipped with several explosion proof exhaust fans which would ventilate the \n    reactor and prevent the buildup of flammable vapors should an accidental spill occur.\n\nEMPLOYEE SAFTEY TRAINING\n\n*  Employees have participated in all aspects of the development and installation of the HPG reaction \n    system.\n*  All employees are trained in the proper safety and handling procedures of the Propylene Oxide.\n*  All employees involved in the use of propylene oxide have received training which includes:\n                1.  Classroom training and discussion.\n                2.  Written exam and testing.\n                3.
