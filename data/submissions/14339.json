A MORE LIKELY OCCURENCE WOULD BE THE LEAKING OF A MUCH SMALLER NURSE TANK.   THESE TANKS HOLD 1000 TO 1500 GALLON VERSUS THE 80,000 GALLON CAPACITY OF THE MAIN TANK.\n     SMITH FERTILIZER AND GRAIN HAS DETIRMINED WHAT EVENTS WOULD MOST LIKELY CAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE.   WE DETIRMINED THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE WOULD BE THE TAMPERING OF EQUIPTMENT BY UNTRAINED INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO OBTAIN ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF ILLEGALLY MANUFACTURING METHSMPHETAMINE.  SMITH FERTILIZER AND GRAIN HAS INITIATED SEVERAL MEASURES TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AND TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE IN THE EVENT AN ACCIDENT WOULD OCCUR.\n     THESE MEASURES INCLUDE:\n1. CONDUCTING REGULAR VISUAL INSPECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO SIGNS OF TAMPERING.\n2. DELIVERING ANHYDROUS AS CLOSE TO TIME OF APPLICATION AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID LEAVING TANKS IN UNATTENDED, DESERTED AREAS.\n3. ENCOURAGING THE PROMPT RETURN OF TANKS FOR THE SAME REASON.\n4. MAKING OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY HAVING DISCUSSIONS AND DISTRIBUTING LITERATURE.\n5. INVITING THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT IN FOR A WALK THROUGH AND PROVIDING TRAINGING TO THEM ON THE SAFE HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS."
