      "SummaryText": "A.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nGeorge F. Joseph O.S., Inc. accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of George F. Joseph O.S., Inc. to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nGeorge F. Joseph, Inc. emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of ammonia releases.\n\nGeorge F. Joseph, Inc. emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees.  George F. Joseph, Inc. has trained its refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\n\nAt George F. Joseph, Inc. anhydrous ammonia is used on-site.  Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n- Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n- Reduce the threat to our personnel\n- Reduce the threat to the community\n\nB.  Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nGeorge F. Joseph, Inc. is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 1151 Cutler Way Zillah, WA 98953.  The facility is located in Yakima County. \n\nThe regulated substance used at George F. Joseph, Inc. is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7).  The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere is 14,728 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nGeorge F. Joseph, Inc. uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, George F. Joseph, Inc. believes in the concept set forth in the \"General Duty Clause\" of the Clean Air Act."

      "SummaryText": "To this effect, George F. Joseph, Inc. has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\nC.  Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios.  The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released ...\".  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the largest vessel would release 14,728 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, however in order to obtain a true worst-case, the entire system inventory (rounded up) of 15,000 pounds was modeled.  The release would occur inside the compressor room, which is not in direct contact with the outside.  However for modeling purposes, no mitigation was used.  Modeling was done by use of ALOHA.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 1.6 miles.  The \"risk radius\" extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public receptors.  Affecting a residential population of 354 and Zillah Middle School.\n\nThere are no environmental receptors within either risk radius.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - For the alternative scenario, it was assumed that the system would lose its entire inventory over a 30 minute period, without any mitigation.  Modeling was done by use of ALOHA.\n\nThe distance to the toxic end-point of 0.14 mg/L is 0.3 mile.  The \"risk radius\" extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public receptors.  Affecting a residential population of 10.\n\nBoth the \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios are highly unlikely due to the safeties on the system such as high temperature/pressure cutouts, computer controls and pressure relief valves to prevent an overpressure situat"

In scenarios modeled for this type of an event, the risk radius was reduced down to approximately 200 yards.\n\nThe area of greatest concern is Zillah Middle School.  In the event of a release, the school could be affected.  The school superintendent will be contacted before school starts in the fall of 1999 and will be provided with the recommended actions for an unplanned ammonia release and notification procedures.\n\nD.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nGeorge F. Joseph, Inc.  accidental release prevent program is based on the following key elements:\n- High level of training of personnel\n- Preventative maintenance program\n- Written safety procedures and safety equipment\n- Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nGeorge F. Joseph, Inc. also complies with:\n- OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rule.\n- Washington State's safety regulations (WAC's 296-24 and 296-62), which are equal to, or more restrictive than OSHA regulations.\n- IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices.\n- The Uniform Fire Code for handling of hazardous materials.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to codes and good practices at the time of installation.  Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles. Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices George F. Joseph, Inc. utilizes include:\n- Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n- Suction trap hi-level float\n- High discharge pressure shut down\n- Low suction pressure shut down\n- High discharge temperature shut down\n- Oil pressure failure shut down\n- High amperes shut down\n- Automatic timer to prevent short cycling\n- Oil filters plugged shut down\n- 250 psi relief valves on high pre"

Joseph, Inc. has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.\n\nSafety orientation includes making all employees aware of the evacuation plan and/or the shelter in place plan.  The supervisors are provided with the contact numbers for our own emergency responders Milo Elander and Dan Hargroves (Zillah Fire Chief) to coordinate either the evacuation or the shelter-in-place program.\n\nRefrigeration personnel have received 24-hour Emergency responder training and the 8 hr. Emergency response team refresher in accordance with 1910.120.  The Ammonia Safety Training Institute (ASTI) did this training.  The refrigeration specialists Milo Elander and Dan Hargroves (Zillah Fire Chief) has also been through the Ammonia Emergency response On-scene Incident Commander training.
