Written policies exist to address written policy requirements from OSHA (i.e. chemical hazard communication, lockout tagout, confined space entry, emergency action plans, hot work, line breaking and PSM) in addition a written contractor safety program is in place.\n\nSenior managemnt has appointed a PSM team to monitor and maintain overall compliance with both OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP program.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances:\nThe stationary source subject to this RMP is Cargill's turkey processing facility located in St. Pauls, N.C.  The regulated substance that is the subject of this RMP is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility is ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components:  process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents and hot work permit portocols.  This program was developed with the participation the the affected employees, and is periodically audited for compliance as required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.
