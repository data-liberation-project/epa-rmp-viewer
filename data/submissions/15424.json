RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nScenarios for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of Ethylenediamine.  The scenario involves the release of 403 lb. of Ethylenediamine in a liquid form over 60 minutes.  The release is completely contained within a diked area.  Evaporation from that pool within the dike occurs over 60 minutes.  Calculations take into account the worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) in an urban setting, and are calculated to a toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg/l.\n\nOne alternative release scenario is submitted for each toxic substance that may be present in Program 2 processes cumulatively.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ethylenediamine involves a vessel release from a leaking drum.  The scenario involves the release of 403 lb. of Ethylenediamine. It is assumed that the release takes place for 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure within the warehouse are taken into account to calculate the scenario. These mitigation controls are expected to limit the extent of the spill and reduce the amount released by 99%.  Calculations are based on the most common weather conditions, in an urban setting and are calculated to a toxic endpoint of 0.49 mg/l, which is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nScenarios for Flammable Substances\n\nThe worst case release scenario submi"

Under worst case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed), in an urban setting, the endpoint is calculated to 1-psi overpressure. is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for flammable substances involves a release of Isopropylamine from a drum in the warehouse.  The release is assumed to result in a pool fire. The scenario involves a 60-minute release of 305 lb. of Isopropylamine.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a pool.  An ignition source reaches the pool, resulting in a pool fire.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures and dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system(s) and fire monitors.  Under neutral weather conditions, the endpoint is calculated to the distance from a pool fire to a radiant heat level that could cause second degree burns from a 40-second exposure (5 kilowatts/square meter).  This maximum distance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\n4.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Evans Harvey are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Evans Harvey facility's primary activity is the warehousing of chemicals. Evans warehouses up to 2 regulated substances at our facility.  These substances are listed below.  Evans receives the regulated substances in bulk and stores the products.  Drummed products are either warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are present onsite at a given time.  \n\nChemical                                                                             CAS No.\nToxic Substances:\nEthylenediamine                                                                107-15-3\n\nFlammable Substances (Liquid Form):\nIsopropylamine                                                                   75-31-0\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nEvans is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.

These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEvans promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nEvans has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years so that no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nEvans has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident return to wok procedure\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSince the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program, there have been no developments or findings that indicate the immediate need to improve safety at our facility.  We have a continuous improvement policy in place that includes safety issues.\n\n8.

The checklist method is used to carry out our process hazard analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of personnel with experience in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis or when there is a change in the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Evans maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nEvans has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive training and are tested for competency before starting work.  Refresher training is provided on a regular basis and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEvans carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure valves, hoses and piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
