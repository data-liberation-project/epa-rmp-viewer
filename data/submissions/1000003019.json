      "SummaryText": "The Des Moines Metropolitan Wastewater Reclamation Authority (WRA) treats the wastewater of Polk County and surrounding areas and stores chlorine and digester gas (methane) in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP/PSM is required.\n\nChlorine is used to disinfect the wastewater effluent before it is discharged to the Des Moines River.  The WRA's disinfection building allows for storage of 20 1-ton chlorine cylinders, but at any given time, only 10 are in use.  \n\nDigester gas is a byproduct of the biosolids stabilization process and consists primarily of methane and carbon dioxide.  This methane can be stored and used as a power source in the plant facility, or if in excess, burned off by the plant flare.  The largest methane storage vessel located at the WRA is the gas storage sphere, which can contain up to 15,712 lbs of methane at a maximum pressure of 45 psig.  \n\nThe Des Moines WRA has instituted a prevention program designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.  The prevention program consists of twelve elements, a few of which are highlighted below.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions and external factors that might affect the processes are the focus of the PHAs.  This information is used by WRA staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases.  \n\nOperating procedures for the chlorine and digester gas systems have been developed to assure continuous, efficient and safe operation of the facility.  The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process.  Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.  \n\nSelect WRA staff have been trained to respond to an accidental release.  Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlor"

      "SummaryText": "ination or digester gas processes must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process.  Training must emphasize safety and health hazards and safe work practices.  Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years whereas refresher training for emergency response is conducted annually.  \n\nThe WRA screens potential contractors to ensure that they select ones who can perform work on or adjacent to the chlorine and digester gas processes without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility.  \n\nTo ensure that hot work, such as welding, is performed safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed which requires a permit be issued before hot work can begin.  \n\nA new or significantly modified process will not be allowed to start-up  without first performing a Pre-Startup Safety Review.  The purpose of a Pre-Startup Safety Review is to ensure that the facility is ready to introduce hazardous chemicals and is ready to operate new and modified regulated processes safely.  \n\nThe mechanical integrity program addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules and personnel training.  The intent of this program is to ensure that equipment used to process, store or handle chlorine and digester gas is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.  \n\nThe Des Moines WRA adheres to a Management of Change system.  Under this system, all modifications to the chlorine or digester gas systems are reviewed before they are implemented to determine if the modification will compromise system safety. The intent is to require that any modifications made to equipment, procedures, or process conditions (other than replacement-in-kind) be managed by identifying and reviewing before implementation.  \n\nLastly, each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a release of chlorine or digester gas is investigated.  The WRA has d"

      "SummaryText": "eveloped a process to identify the underlying causes of an incident and implement procedures in order to prevent similar events from occurring in the future.    \n\nThe Des Moines WRA has set up an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine or digester gas.  The ERP procedures cover a release from the initial alarm stage through either leak stoppage or Hazmat assistance.  As part of the emergency response procedures, there are plans for victim rescue, leak investigation and communication with additional support agencies.  In addition, critical plant operations are identified to ensure that, if possible, the critical WRA functions are kept operational.  The ERP also addresses plant site communication, emergency response equipment, first aid and medical treatment, medical surveillance and consultation, and emergency response drills."
