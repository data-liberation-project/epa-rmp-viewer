Facility Policy\n\n                    The owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop\n                     are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of\n                      anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should \n                     occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,\n                     or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of\n                     the release to people and the environment.\n\n             2.   Facility Information\n\n\n                   The primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is the storage and \n                    blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  The primary activity of our\n                    propane facilities is the storage and resale of propane to our member patrons.\n\n                   Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct\n                   application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production \n                   nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in\n                   in heating and grain drying.\n\n\n                    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in a 30,000 gallon capacity\n                     tank at 85% full is 131,325# at the Blencoe, IA facility.  In addition, 42 - 1,000 gallon  nurse tanks are generally at this site.            \n\n                    The maximum quantity of propane stored in a 28,000 "

The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\n                     a.  The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the\n                     release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10\n                     minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 131,325 pounds, which\n                     represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent capacity as\n                     limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of 200 PPM)\n                     is 2.4 miles at the location with the largest storage.  The worst case release \n                     scenario for propane would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n                     tank released as a gas.  The maximum quantity release would be 99,996\n                     pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent\n                     capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint\n                     (point of 1-psi overpressure) is a maximum of .4 miles at the location\n                     with the largest storage.\n\n                     b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year history ( or the\n                     most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transer hose.  The\n                     distance to the endpoint for anhydrous ammonia (point of dispersion to 200 ppm)\n                     is .41 miles.\n\n                          The alternative release scenario based on the five-year history (or the most\n                     likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance\n                     to the endpoint for propane (point of dispersion to 1 psi) is .3 miles.\n\n       4.
