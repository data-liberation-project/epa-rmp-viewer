Rose\n    Phone:    618-963-2205\n\n    1.    Facility Policy\n    \n           The owners,  Management and employees of Circle R Fertilize, Inc. Are committed to the prevent-\n           ion of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. If any accidental releases should occur,\n           the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, White county LEPC, and/or other \n           authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n   2.    Facility Information.\n   \n          The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous\n   ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.      \n   The maximum quantity stored would be 260,000 pounds in the storage tank and nurse tanks.\n   \n   3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n          A.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank \n    released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 \n    pounds, which representsthe volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design \n    standards and administrative controls. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts\n    per million, or ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\n          B.   The alternate release scenario, a 3 inch pipe is used as an alternate release scenario followed\n    by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves\n    intervennes, or a valve is closed manually downstream of the leak, and stops the flow of ammonia.\n    The maximum quantity released wold be 26,638 pounds. The endpoint(point of dispersion to 200\n    parts per million) is .78 mile.\n\n  4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program."
