Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, and neighbors.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe ProMix Fractionator is owned by K/D/S ProMix, LLC, which is a partnership owned by Dow Chemical and Enterprise Products Partners.  Enterprise Products Operating, LLC (Enterprise) id the operator of the plant.\r\n\r\nAt the facility, the plant receives natural gas liquids (NGL) as feedstock from natural gas processing facilities.  The incoming plant feed is fed directly into the plant from an incoming pipeline.  This feedstock is treated (for removal of CO2) prior to entering the fractionation process.  This is accomplished by an Amine system, which uses a Diethanolamaine and Methyldiethanolamine mixture to remove the CO2.  \r\n\r\nThe facility has a capability to fractionate the feedstock into six product streams:\r\n\r\n\tPurity Ethane\r\n      Ethane/Propane (E-P) Mix\r\n\tPropane\r\n\tIso-Butane"

Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe ProMix Fractionation Plant uses Enterprise software-based change approval system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented to ensure that the safety of the facility is not compromised by the change.  Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe ProMix Fractionation Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the ProMix Fractionation Plant is coordinated with the Assumption Parish Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.
