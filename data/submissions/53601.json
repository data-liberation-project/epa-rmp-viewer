Terracon prepared the following executive summary based on the previous executive summary provided by KNC.\n68.155 Executive summary.\nThe owner or operator shall provide in the RMP an executive summary that includes a brief description of the following elements: \n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source; \n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled; \n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \n(d) The five-year accident history; \n(e) The emergency response program; and \n(f) Planned changes to improve safety. \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility:  The facility complies with OSHA?s 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage, and it is the facility?s policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is KNC?s policy to notify Marshall County Emergency Management Agency or the Sheriff?s Office.  \n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: The Koch Nitrogen Company, LLC - Marshalltown Ammonia Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in and distributes it from two refrigerated cylinder tanks (60,000,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per tank), one 90,000-gallon bullet tank (394,000 pounds), and one 61,000-gallon bullet tank (267,000 pounds).  The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 120,661,000 pounds.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: The facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\nFive-year accident "

      "SummaryText": "history: On March 14, 2005, an independent contractor mistakenly opened the wrong valve on a tanker truck during a routine product transfer.  The contractor sustained chemical burns to his thighs and was sent to the hospital for treatment.   Approximately 20 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were released during the incident.  Solar Transport Co. was deemed the responsible party.  Two separate incidents, involving product release, occurring July 24, 2005 and November 9, 2005 were reported to regulatory agencies.  The releases were not identified as causing deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facility?s policy to notify the Marshall County Emergency Management Agency and request that they respond to the emergency.  The facility has discussed this policy with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None identified at this time."
