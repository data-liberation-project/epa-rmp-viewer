      "SummaryText": "Republic Plastics owns and operates a polystyrene foam products manufacturing facility located in McQueeney, Guadalupe County, Texas.  The facility is designed to manufacture polystyrene products which involve the use and storage of Isobutane and polystyrene pellets, the pressurization of Isobutane gas in a high pressure building, extrusion, roll storage and aging, thermoforming and stamping, and fluff reclamation. The equipment associated with the production of foam products consists of extruders, thermoformers, pellet feed silos, fluff surge hoppers, and associated storage and packaging areas. In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) definition for a process, the facility is defined as the Isobutane tank located outside, the associated piping, pumps leading up to the high pressure building, and distribution of the Isobutane to the extruders.\n\n\n\nSection 112 of the Clean Air Act applies to the Republic Plastics facility in Mcqueeney because the facility handles and stores Isobutane, a RMP-regulated flammable gas, in excess of the threshold quantities. Two (2) requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant: \n\n\n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Republic Plastics is committed to ensuring the safe operation of its Isobutane facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Republic Plastics, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the facility and community-wide by coordinating with the local Fire Department.\n\n\n\n2.
