If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Centre Hall Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis is a frozen food processing facility. We use propane for the winter heating of the Plant, Potato Storage Facility and the Waste Water Treatment Plant. Propane is also used to refuel a few lift trucks on the premises. There are three separate propane systems at the facility. System #1 is located behind the Potato Storage Facility. It consists of two 2,500 gallon tanks and associated piping, valves and heating units with burners, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. System #2 is located behind the Main Plant Building. It consists of 1 18,000 gallon tank, piping, valves and associated heaters and other miscellaneous equipment including a bottle fill station and scales.System #3 is located at the Waste Water Treatment Plant. It consists of two 500 gallon tanks, piping, valves and heaters and other miscellaneous equipment. \n\nThe worst case scenario is failure of the 18,000 gallon tank when filled to its greatest allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA look up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles. The facility does have public receptors within this range both on site and off. The potential could be as many as 20 persons.There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\n The facility does comply with both EPA and OSHA accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. \n\nThis facility has not had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property damage or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Centre Hall Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.
