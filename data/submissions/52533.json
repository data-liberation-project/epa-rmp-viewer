This Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as listed in the RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the stationary source.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION AND PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nEagle Rock maintains process safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the facility.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the facility are maintained in the RMP at the facility.\n\nThe facility conducts safety inspections and hazard analyses to identify and control the hazards associated with the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (40 CFR 68.155 (E))\n\nThe Facility has had one reportable accident of covered processes in the five years previous to August 15, 2008, the submission date of the RMP plan.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (40 CFR 68.155 (F))\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Program that is called their Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regulated substance accidental release.  Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  In the event of a covered process accident, first aid procedures, and procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency"
