      "SummaryText": "The Valparaiso Department of Water Works' (VWD)  accidental release prevention policy uses such technologies, procedures and management practices to ensure compliance with the requirements of the USEPA Program. The VWD's Release Response Plan uses the services of the local community Fire Department and County HAZMAT.  The Flint Lake Treatment Plant 2 was built in 1993 and was designed to disinfect and treat ground water from eight deep wells. The Plant is located at 2101 Wesley Road. This plant provides treated water to the City of Valparaiso and the neighboring Lakes Area Conservancy District area. The treatment includes a chlorination room that contains one ton cylinders of chlorine gas. Other equipment and processes included in the plant are: motor control equipment, pumps, iron and manganese removal pressure filter vessels, SCADA equipment and other security and safety equipment. This building is unmanned, with personnel visiting the building each of three shifts and daily for routine maintenance. Other chemicals in the facility are hydrofluosilicic acid, ortho-poly phosphate and sodium bisulfite (each chemical is stored in separate rooms. The VWD's accidental chemical release response program consists of three elements: plant personnel training, preventative maintenance, and the use of state-of-the-art process control systems and safety equipment.  No accidental release of chlorine gas has occurred at this plant in the past 10 years. The Chlorine Release Response Plan has been reviewed by the Valparaiso Fire Department."
