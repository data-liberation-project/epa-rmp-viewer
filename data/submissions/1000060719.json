This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. FHR Fairmont is subject to the RMP rule due to the onsite storage of natural gasoline (denaturant), a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantities.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nFHR Fairmont is committed to protecting the environment and operating FHR Fairmont in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to applicable federal and state rules and regulations, and as such the design and construction of FHR Fairmont has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of personnel, FHR Fairmont has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a release, the FHR Fairmont's emergency response is described in its Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan. The ERAP consist of procedures for responding to releases, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address emergency response (including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures), evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an e"

In addition, FHR Fairmont has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions on the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training on performing their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to FHR Fairmont processes or emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nFHR Fairmont is a corn-based denatured ethanol fuel production plant which operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a batch fermentation and continuous distillation process.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulated material stored at FHR Fairmont is natural gasoline which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nFHR Fairmont has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. FHR Fairmont complies with RMP for the management of regulated substances such as ethanol, fuel additives, and denaturant (natural gasoline).\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe site has not had any RMP reportable events within the past 5 years. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nFHR encourages employees to participate in safety management and accident prevention. FHR Fairmont has developed an employee participation program as part of the RMP program. Process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA)"

The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: fire, explosion, over-pressurization, overfilling, equipment failure, and the loss of cooling, heating, electricity, and instrument air. FHR Fairmont utilizes process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, rupture discs, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases. FHR Fairmont also utilizes dike containment around FHR Fairmont's storage tanks, including the denaturant storage tank, to contain and mitigate liquid releases.\r\n\r\nFHR Fairmont keeps a variety of technical documents onsite that are used to help maintain safe operation of FHR Fairmont and provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Training\r\nFHR Fairmont is responsible for developing and implementing written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the RMP. The operating procedures that have been developed have been prepared as a guide for those involved with initial start-up, normal operation, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown of the process. FHR Fairmont has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in facility operations.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nFHR Fairmont's contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employe"

After the contractor has been selected, the FHR Fairmont representative conducts a contractor orientation meeting with the contract employer representative. At that time, FHR reviews known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards that are related to the contractor's work and the covered process. The contract employer representative is also informed of the applicable provisions of the emergency action plan, conditions regarding entrance to the process and the applicable safe work practices that must be followed in order to work at the site. Because contractors may work on or near the process equipment, FHR Fairmont has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, and are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\nAs part of the management of change (MOC) process, whenever a modification to the existing process is planned, either temporary or permanent, FHR Fairmont requires a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). The PSSR confirms that, prior to putting into service, the construction and equipment being used is in accordance with design specifications. The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate training for each involved employee has been completed. A PSSR includes field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention measures are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nFHR Fairmont's mechanical integrity program was developed as part of RMP that defines requirements for ensuring the integrity of process equipment.
