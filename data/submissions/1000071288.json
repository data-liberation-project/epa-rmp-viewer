              "Description": "The anhydrous ammonia storage tank is interconnected to the PAO production process through process piping and is used as a neutralizer in the process. The storage vessel stores the anhydrous ammonia as a liquid and utilizes pressure relief valves as a control device. The storage vessel is built to pressure vessel codes. Hydrant monitors are positioned to provide coverage and can be used as a mitigation device in the event of a leak. The PAO process is protected by relief valves, manual and remotely actuated block valves, and a  Distributed Control System (DCS) with numerous process monitors, warnings and alarms. The unit operators utilized standard operating procedures to ensure proper operation ofthe unit. Lyondell Chemicals, the operator of the unit, has a complex wide Emergency Response Team which has the capacity and training to respond to fires and hazardous material releases. Boron Trifluoride (BF3) is utilized in the manufacture of PAO as a catalyst. BF3 is received from the manufacturer as a compressed gas in dedicated tube trailers. Inventory is limited and only one tube trailer is connected to the process at any given time. The process itself is protected by relief devices, vents, manual and remotely activated block valves, and a DCS. The DCS system monitors the process and provides warnings and alarms. BF3 unloading and storage is in a enclsure protected by a remotely or locally activated water curtain. The plant operators are provided training on standard operating procedures, and abnormal and emergency situations.  The site provides an Emergency Response Team that provides fire and hazardous materials release response. Team members are trained in fire and hazardous material release response.",

As part of this commitment, INEOS has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) which helps manage the risks and which complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: the RMP rule. This summary is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 through 40 CFR 68.185). \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nINEOS is committed to the welfare of its employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment. INEOS implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, INEOS will conduct emergency response action to help prevent or minimize harm to the public and the environment. \n\n\n\nFacility Process and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe INEOS Oligomers La Porte is a chemical manufacturer of polyalphaolefins (PAO), a synthetic hydrocarbon chain for use in a variety of consumer applications. The manufacturing process uses boron trifluoride (BF3) and ammonia for producing PAO.  Both are regulated substances above the threshold quantity. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\n1. Process Safety Information - Oligomers La Porte maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the covered processes. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled. The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards. \n\n\n\n2.

A corporate procedure for the conduct of PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk includes consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public. \n\n\n\n3. Operating Procedures - Oligomers La Porte maintains its operating procedures under an ISO9001 program. As such, it is required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. \n\n\n\n4. Training - To complement the written procedures for process operations, Oligomers La Porte has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operators receive both on-the-job and classroom training. A unit walkthrough test and final peer review ensure trainees have the required level of practical knowledge. In addition, all operators receive refresher training at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. A record of all operator training is maintained.\n\n\n\n5. Mechanical Integrity -  Oligomers La Porte has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The  components of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \n\n\n\n6.

Each MOC includes a risk assessment to identify the potential hazards of the change as well as review of  a supplemental checklist to identify any effects of the change on areas such as Safety & Health, Environmental, Process Engineering & Control, and Maintenance. \n\n\n\n7. Pre-Startup Review - Oligomers La Porte performs a thorough review on any new or existing process modified in a manner which requires updating of process safety information. This review confirms (1) the change was made as per the agreed upon design , (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a risk assessment has been conducted, and (4) training has been implemented. \n\n\n\n8. Compliance Audits - Oligomers La Porte performs PSM and RMP compliance audits at least every three years. Audits targeting specific regulatory element requirements may be performed more frequently through the Operational Audit process, if needed. \n\n\n\n9. Incident Investigation - Oligomers La Porte investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment. The incident investigation procedure requires an investigation team to be assembled and that the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.
