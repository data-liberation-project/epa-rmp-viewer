Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - In addition to engineering review and hazard analysis previously mentioned, workers who perform operations involving covered chemicals receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures developed by INEOS in conjunction with the chemical supplier. In addition, several safeguards are in place such as: hydrocarbon detection, automated deluge systems, periodic piping and vessel inspection and maintenance, and continuous process monitoring. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program \r\n\r\nINEOS Oligomers La Porte has established a written emergency response plan which complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plans. This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel. The facility has an operator on each shift who is a fully trained volunteer responder that belongs to the Lyondell Basell emergency response team, to ensure 24-hour coverage. INEOS Oligomers conducts quarterly emergency response drills including annual drills coordinated with the local response authorities. INEOS Oligomers La Porte is a member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA). CIMA supplements on-site emergency responders at neighboring facilities in the event that additional resources are needed.

Operating Procedures - Oligomers La Porte maintains its operating procedures under an ISO9001 program. As such, it is required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. \r\n\r\n4. Training - To complement the written procedures for process operations, Oligomers La Porte has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operators receive both on-the-job and classroom training. A unit walkthrough test and final peer review ensure trainees have the required level of practical knowledge. In addition, all operators receive refresher training at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. A record of all operator training is maintained.\r\n\r\n5. Mechanical Integrity -  Oligomers La Porte has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The  components of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. \r\n\r\n6.
