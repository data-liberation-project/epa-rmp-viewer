Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant are strongly committed to associate, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass finishing textile fabrics.  We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The chlorine is used for water and wastewater dechlorination while the sulfur dioxide is used for wastewater treatment.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 10,000 pounds while sulfur dioxide is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 8,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Facilities Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of chlorine from the wastewater treatment plant.  In this scenario 6000 pounds of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid  released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated toevaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 55% due to passive mitigation.  At"

      "SummaryText": " Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a hole in the vapor space of a tank.  This scenario involves the release of 180 pounds of chlorine.  A 1/4-inch diameter hole has a release rate of 9 pounds per minute.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s windspeed, the maximun distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nA similiar alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a hole in the vapor space of a tank.  This scenario involves the release of 60 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  A 1/4-inch diameter hole has a release rate of 4 pounds per minute.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Speciffic Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are "

A PHA/update was conducted on 05/28/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations,  emergency shutdown, emergency operations,normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that associates who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and  pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel  are offered specialized training as needed..  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The must recent review/revision of maintenance procedures will be performed on 08/25/1999.

These reviews will be conducted to confrim that construction, equipment, operating  and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine wheter the provision set out under both PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.  A compliance audit is scheduled for 08/25/1999.  These audits will be carried out a least every three years and any corrective action required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nAssociate Participation\nDan River Inc. - Brookneal Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Associates familiar with the processes involved participate in the committee that develops and implements these programs.   In addition, our associates have access to  all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
