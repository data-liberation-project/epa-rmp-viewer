The information presented in the RMP is derived from data obtained in Chase Products Company's Emergency Response Contingency Plan and interviews with operations personnel.\n\n\n\nChase Products Co. manufactures an extensive list of aerosol-type products.  Some examples of these products include personal hygiene (i.e., spray detergents, hair spray, etc.) and residential use (i.e., glass cleaner, insecticides and spray paints).  Chase Products Co. uses an aerosol propellant storage system to contain their (75% 152a/25% n-butane); A46 (74% n-butane/26% propane); and A80 (62% propane/38% n-butane) gases which are used as the primary propellants in their aerosol products.  The system consists of three on-site USTs, each having a maximum storage capacity of 18,000 gallons.  The USTs are connected to a series of pumps and conveyance pipes, which ultimately transfer the propellants to 16-ounce (12.25 oz net) product cans.  Because Chase Products Co.'s aerosol propellant storage system is subject to OSHA PSM standards, the system falls under Program 3 requirements according to EPS's Risk Management Program.  No additional RMP processes were identified at the site.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description\n\n\n\nThis RMP report details the operations associated with the propellant storage system used in the manufacturing of aerosol type products.  The following stationary sources of propane,and n-butane within the storage system include:\n\n    \n\nUSTs - the three USTs each have an operating capacity of 18,000 gallons. The USTs are connected to a series of pumps and above ground pipes for transfer into the facility's aerosol can production line.  The USTs are considered to be a stationary source because of the potential to leak the entire amount of their contents, resulting in a"

These valves may be manually operated to isolate sections of the propellant distribution system. In addition nitrogen actuated safety valves were installed as well An exterior valve is considered a stationary source since a leak may develop around the valve stem packing, which may produce a vapor cloud that could potentially ignite and travel offsite.

This commitment to safety is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training programs and administrative controls in our process.  \n\nChase Products Co. utilizes the elements of a process safety management (PSM) program to ensure that our propellant storage system is operated in the safest manner achievable.\n\n                                            \n\nThe process at the facility that is regulated by the RMP is also OSHAA?s PSM standard.  Chase Products Co.'s PSM program includes detailed process safety information.  Chase Products Co. conducts process hazards analyses to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage the hazards.  Operations at the facility are conducted according to standard operating procedures and employees are trained on the procedures.  Chase Products Co. ensures mechanical integrity of its propellant storage system by conducting routine daily inspections and promptly correcting identified deficiencies.  Chase Products Co.'s flammable substance release prevention programs include temperature sensors and pressure gauges located along the piping network to the USTs containing the flammable propellants.  In addition, flammable gas release detection sensors are located in "

The planA?s purpose is to establish emergency and notification procedures to be followed in the event of chemical, environmental or other emergencies.  Personnel are trained as emergency coordinators and responders, and Chase Products Co. conducts tabletop and hands-on emergency response drills annually.  In addition, the plan is reviewed at least annually and is amended as necessary.  Some of the response actions are coordinated with the Broadview Fire Department and the LaGrange Park Fire Department.
