This comprehensive program has been developed to enable all those who may be affected to be able to identify and understand the hazards posed by the processes that involve the covered chemicals.\n\nThis CalARP and EPA Risk Management Program will be regularely reviewed and updated as required, and whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks and procedures.  This Program document, as well as the other documents and reports that are created pursuant to this Program, will be accessible to our employees and made available to other affected persons in accordance with applicable requirements and the provisions of the CalARP Program.\n\nThe emergency response policy at this facility supports proper external notification and evacuation procedures for a facility that will not attempt to abate uncontrolled releases of these substances but will, instead, rely upon the fire department and county Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the regulation.  We shall, at a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of process hazard analyses, (2) consult with employees and their representatives on the development of the other elements of accidental release prevention, and (3) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under the regulation.\n\nIt is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal and st"

Our objective is to observe all necessary safety precautions while handling hazardous chemicals to prevent unnecessary exposures by our workers as well as the community.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nShore Chemical Company is located at 743 North Tully Road in Turlock, California.  The facility lies in this most southern city of Stanislaus County adjacent to State Highway 99.  The facility is bordered by Canal Drive on the north, State Highway 99 on the west, North Tully Road on the east, and a commercial establishment on the south.\n\nThe immediate area around the facility includes comercial establishments, residences, County Road J17 (West Main Street) less than 1/2 mile to the south and the Turlock Memorial Cemetery to the east.\n\nCurrently, there are five (5) employees at this facility, including office and yard staff.  The facility operates five (5) days per week (Monday - Friday) and the hours of operation are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\nThe facility is primarily comprised of two (2) warehouses, each with covered and elevated concrete docks where the regulated substances are stored.  The main facilty entrance, which passes through a cyclone fence gate, is located along North Tully Road.  A cyclone fence encircles the entire perimeter of the facility and an additional gate (locked) is located along the east fence north of the main entrance.  Access is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and customers.  Lights and cameras provide additional security measures.\n\nThe office is located immediately beyond the main entrance and is attached to Warehouse \"A\".  The facility also includes a storm drainage pond along the west perimeter and a mobile home on the south perimeter.  Three (3) storm drains discharge rainwater runoff to the storm drainage pond.\n\nThe warehouse buildings are contructed of structural steel, with concrete block and architectural steel panel walls, and poured concrete floor"

      "SummaryText": "s.  Each warehouse building measures approximately 90' x 120', including the covered docks.  A building permit and certificate of occupancy were obtained from the City of Turlock around 1980.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to warehouse and distribute industrial and agricultural chemicals, both hazardous and non-hazardous.  Shore Chemical Company does not perform repackaging of its chemicals.  Some chemicals are stored inside the warehouse buildings, but all regulated substances subject to this program are stored outside under the covered docks.  This facility also stores and distributes non-chemical items such as polyethylene sheeting, rope & twine, and vineyard & tree wire for wholesale and retail customers.\n\nAll four (4) applicable chemical substances are stored in industry-standard containers as appropriate for the particular chemical.  Propylene oxide, used by food manufacturing plants as a commodity fumigant, is packaged by the manufacturer and stored in extra-strong, 16-gauge, 55-gallon steel drums.  Formaldehyde is packaged in 55-gallon polyethylene drums for use by the dairy industry.\n\nThe two substances that are regulated by the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP)Program, but not by the federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Program, are methyl bromide and anhydrous ammonia.  Each of these chemicals is packaged by the manufacturer and stored in industry-standard, D.O.T.-approved cylinders.\n\nEach of these regulated substances is delivered to the facility in trucks and off-loaded for storage and eventual sale.  Equipment for loading and unloading hazardous chemicals onto, and from, delivery trucks are maintained as required for safe operation.\n\nSafety measures include cylinder caps, elevated docks, fire extinguishers, fire sprinkler system, and portable eyewash containers.  All employees who handle hazardous chemicals are trained to understand and implement the written operating and maintenance procedures.  Each employee is also tra"

Since two of the four regulated substances are subject to the OSHA PSM Standard, the chemicals are consequently subject to the Program 3 release prevention steps.  As a result, the PSM Standard has been implemented for all applicable chemicals to improve safety and facilitate administration of the program under one accidental release prevention program.  The elements, summarized in the CalARP Program Manual, Chapter 7 (Prevention Program), include all requirements under the OSHA PSM Standard.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility in the last (5) years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nShore Chemical Company maintains an Emergency Action Plan as described in the CalARP Program Manual.  The emergency response measures primarily include the safe evacuation of all personnel and notification to outside emergency responders.  Incidental releases that do not pose an imminent safety hazard may be abated by employees who are trained to provide such a response, are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), are authorized and trained by Shore Chemical Company to perform such activities, and are in the area of the release at the time of discovery.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nModifications to these storage processes are implemented through the Management of Change program component as a result of Process Hazard Analyses recommendations, Compliance Audit findings, Incident Investigations, regulatory audits, and self-discovery.  Deficiencies are scheduled for correction and completed in a timely manner.\n\n"
