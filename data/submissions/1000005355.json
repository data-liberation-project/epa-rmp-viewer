      "SummaryText": "PB Leiner USA is a manufacturer of gelatin and specialized protein located in Davenport, Iowa.  A single raw material, pig skin, is used in the process of gelatin and protein manufacturing.  This facility handles ammonia which is considered toxic by the US environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  This facility was owned by Hormel from 1978 until 1998, Leiner Davis Gelatin from 1998 until 2003 when it was purchased by the Tessenderlo Group.\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products, and for humidity control.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the raw materials and products being handled.  The main supply of ammonia is stored in steel tanks located at various areas within the facility.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place for many years.  The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with state codes, as available during the time of construction.  Equipment up grades have been scheduled as warranted to maintain the equipment.   This processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all"

      "SummaryText": "applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained, including using a contractor to train in basic refrigeration system operation.  The facility program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program based on suggestions provided by IIAR and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Davenport Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Davenport Fire Department visited this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to minimize any ammonia release.  These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThere has been no reportable accidents in the past 5 years related to the ammonia system.  The facility is dedicated to continuous improvement of all systems, specifically those that can have a large impact on environment and safety, such as the refrigeration system.\n\nIn regards to the worst case release scenario for the chemicals as defined by EPA, the worst case release for ammonia from the high pressure receiver could travel off site. An alternative, more likely, release scenario could just extend beyond the property but not in all directions.\n\nIn all cases of a potential release, the extent of downwind areas affected are dependent on the amount of chemical released, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, etc..\n\nThe basis for the Risk Management"

The vessel is 4 feet in diameter and 18 feet long.  The calculated volume of the tank is 262.2 cft or 1961 gallons or 8788 lbs when full at a pressure of 85 psig, and temperature of 53 oF, yielding a density of 38.85 lbs/cft.  For the worst case, using 8800 lbs.  Using the RMP*COMP for the release rate of 880 (900) lbs/min.  Based on this release rate, the distance is 1.2 miles for an Urban setting to the toxic end point of 200 ppm.  Using LandView 6, an affected population of 2065 was determined using the \"Estimate Population within a Radius\" tool.\n\n2 \tAlternative release:   Release  of ammonia liquid from a ruptured Evaporative Condenser tube which is located outside.  Using RPM*Comp for a relief valve opening on a high pressure receiver, releasing gas liquified by pressure at a rate of 61.5 lbs/min yields a distance to the toxic end point of 200 ppm in an Urban setting of 0.1 miles.  The population affected is \u00c2\u00bf0\u00c2\u00bf based on the \"Estimate Population within a Radius\" tool within LandView 6."
