PURPOSE\n\nThis document describes Mead  Paper Division - Rumford, Maine mill's philosophy and procedures for managing the risk to employee health, contractor health, public health, and to the environment.  Besides providing a basis for organizing Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan activities, this document also helps to meet the OSHA requirement of 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA requirement of 40CFR Part 68 for a system that oversees the integration and implementation of the elements of a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan programs.  Other specific purposes of this document are (1) to clearly define how our Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) system meets all regulatory requirements and (2) to explain where to find the programs or results related to each regulatory element.  The Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan system is designed to ensure that ongoing implementation is effectively maintained.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nMead  Paper Division - Rumford, Maine is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Mead employees, contractors, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Mead's Rumford Mill has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Two components of this system are a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that helps manage the risk and that complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; and a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Mead. This docu"

These federal regulations apply to this facility because we use various chemicals that are on the PSM/RMP list at or above threshold concentration and quantity.\n\nThe process safety and risk management program at Rumford consists of three elements:\n\n   1.   A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of \n         hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five \n         years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated \n         substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\n   2.   A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than \n         a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n   3.   An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated \n         substances from covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nCOVERED PROCESSES AND NOT-COVERED PROCESSES\n\nMead  Paper Division - Rumford, Maine (\"Rumford\") has Chlorine Dioxide as a covered chemical.  Methanol, a flammable liquid stored in an \"atmospheric tank\", is treated as a covered system for PSM, but is not a covered process for RMP. \n\nPropane, which is stored in excess of 10,000 pounds is not a PSM covered process because it is used for filling propane bottles for industrial trucks, or as a fuel to light off the Lime Kiln burner. Propane is not a covered process for RMP because it is less than the 67,000 pounds limit for the executive stay.\n\nThe Chlorine Dioxide system includes the manufacture and storage of Chlorine Dioxide and ends at the addition of Chlorine Dioxide to the Bleach Plant mixers.  The starting boundaries of the Chlorine Dioxide manufacturing (R-8 Process) begins at the chemical fe"

The boundary for the biocide system starts at the tie in to the 1.2% (12 g/l) solution from the Chlorine Dioxide Storage and ends at the mixer in the R-8 Chlorine Dioxide Plant where the solution is diluted to 0.2 % (2g/l) solution. The dilute piping system (2 g/l) is not a covered process for PSM or RMP.\n\nEven though the methanol system is not a covered process based upon the Meer decision (OSHRC Docket No. 95-0341), we will continue to treat the system as if it were a covered process for PSM.  The ruling was that OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (1910.119) does not extend to stored flammables in \"atmospheric tanks\", even if they were connected to a \"process\" within the definition of the standard.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRumford is committed to the safety and health of Rumford workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Rumford implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at Rumford; and programs to evaluate the hazards at Rumford.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Rumford attempts to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public or the environment.  Rumford provides response training to Rumford personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have been discussed and coordinated with the LEPC.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Rumford established a management sy"

As a part of this manufacturing process,  Rumford handles several regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes at Rumford.\n\n         Process                           Program Level        Regulated Substance     Process Quantity (lb.)\n\n    Chlorine Dioxide                                    3                    Chlorine Dioxide                             11,144\n    Generation and Storage\n\n1.3  Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nRumford performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Rumford does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenario was selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Rumford and (2) would result in the greatest potential off-site consequence if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n      When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the en"

A dike area contains the released chlorine dioxide solution, which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is 0.93 miles.  The U.S. Census indicates that 91 people live within this distance from the storage tank; several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g. commercial businesses).  No environmental receptors are within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is an outside flange or valve leak of an 8-inch chlorine dioxide solution (1.2 wt%) line from the storage tank to a mixer.  This scenario assumes that the solution is released through the flange or valve for 10 minutes before the workers detect the release and isolate the line.  The released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.44 miles.
