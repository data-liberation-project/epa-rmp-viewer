(Producers) utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system at their facility in Fresno, California.  It is Producers\u00bf policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Producers\u00bf objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nAdditionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Producers and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nProducers owns and operates a milk and milk products processing facility located on East Belmont Avenue in Fresno, California.  The corporate office and mailing address is 250 E. Belmont.\n\nThe ammonia-based refrigeration system at Producers provides cooling for the raw milk tanks, the glycol chiller for the pasteurizing process, pasteurized milk tanks, cream tank, cold storage rooms, and the ice makers.  The major components of the refrigeration system are the high pressure receiver, recirculator package, direct expansion evaporators, flooded evaporators, accumulators, compressors, condensers, and water and glycol chillers.\n\nThe largest vessel in the refrigeration system at Producers in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is approximately 35,000 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Producers to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00bf Written process safety information, including informat"

However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Producers\u00bf employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Producers regularly evaluates the need for any additional changes to improve safety.\n\nAs part of the refrigeration system expansion scheduled to be completed in 2004, Producers implemented several improvements to the refrigeration system to enhance the safety of the system, including the following:\n\n\u00bf Installation of a pressure relief header for new and existing equipment.\n\n\u00bf Installation of a new ammonia diffusion system with a 33,000 gallon (nominal capacity) water tank.\n\n\u00bf Installation of new pressure relief valves.  \n\n\u00bf Installation of a visual system (i.e. rupture disk/pressure gauge system) to detect operation of a pressure relief valve(s).  \n\n\u00bf Installation of new and relocated equipment foundations designed to current seismic codes."
