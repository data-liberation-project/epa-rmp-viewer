To meet this commitment, we have established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this plant.  One component of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at the Synair Hawthorne Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our RMP.  Section 2 of this executive summary describes the substances currently used at the Synair Hawthorne Plant in sufficient quantity to be requlated by the RMP rule.\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n1.  A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have ocurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary\n\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 6 of this executive summary\n\n3.  An emergency response program for responding to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 6 of this executive summary\n\nAlthough our RMPlan helps ensure that our plant is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is onl"

In fact, we have a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and against the injuries and damage that could occur from accidental releases.\n\nLimited use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.  Before using a substance regulated by the RMP rule (\"regulated substance\"), we considered less hazardous alternatives.  Once it was determined that we should use a regulated substance, we considered the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, contractors, the public, an the environment and we have taken steps to minimize or prevent any such effects.\n\nPreventing releases of the regulated substances used at the plant.  When a regulated substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Government and corporate standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work to prevent accidental releases from occurring. However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release, including contacting the local agency responsible for responding to accidental releases (e.g., the Emergency Planning Committee [LEPC]) if emergency response actions are neccessary.  We work closely with the LEPC to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.\n\nOur safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.

These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, (2) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process, and (3) programs to evaluate the hazards of our process.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we will strive to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or damage to the environment.  We provide response training to our personnel, including working with the LEPC when executing emergency response actions, so that they are well prepared to respond in the event of an emergency situation.\n\n2.  REGULATED SUBSTANCES USED BY THE SYNAIR HAWTHORNE PLANT\n\nThe Synair Hawthorne Plant has two substances (ethylene oxide and propylene oxide) in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the RMP rule.  Both substances are covered as toxic materials by the RMP rule.\n\n3.  OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we perform an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental releases that could affect the public or the environment.  In accordance with the regulations, we evaluated one worst-case release scenario and two more realistic (but still highly unlikely) alternative release scenarios for the polyol process.\n\nWe do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  This scenario is designed to estimate the maximum possible area that could be affected by a release of either substance from our plant, but it is not a realistic scenario.  The alternative release scenarios were analyzed to help emergency preparedness and to improve the community emergency response plan.

For a release of a toxic material, the toxic endpoint is defined by EPA as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis.\n\n3.1  Worst-case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario is a failure of the ethylene oxide storage tank that results in the release of the entire contents of the tank.  The maximum inventory of 207,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide is assumed to be released over a 10-minute time period.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint (50 ppm) reaches offiste public receptors.\n\n3.2  Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe alternative release scenario for the ethylene oxide is a rupture of the unloading line between the railcar and the storage tank.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint (50 ppm) for this scenario would reach nearby offsite public receptors.  In evaluating this scenario, credit was taken for the reduction in release rate provided by the excess flow valves that are part of the system design.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the propylene oxide is also a rupture of the unloading line between the railcar and the storage tank.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint (250 ppm) for this scenario would reach offsite, but would not reach any nearby public receptors.  In evaluating this scenario, credit was taken for the reduction in release rate provided by the excess flow valve in the unloading line and also for the presence of a diked area designed to minimize the evaporation rate  of propylene oxide in case of accidental release.\n\n4.

For the Synair Hawthorne Plant, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are also satisfied by this PSM program.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\n\n4.1  Prevention Program\nOur accident prevention program for the polyol process consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.  Process safety information.  We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan, to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our plant.  These documents address (a) physical properties of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, (b) operating parameters for our equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to our employees.\n\n2.  Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update a process hazard analysis of our polyol process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that will improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the polyol process.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard hazard analysis experience.  The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the polyol process.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to plant personnel, and, when analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n3.  Operating procedures.  Our "

Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\n4.  Training.  We train employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the system, (b) the properties and hazards of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, and (c) a detailed review of the operating procedures and safe work practices.  Classroom training and demonstrations are used to help train employees.  Oral reviews and demonstrations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can work on the polyol process.\n\n5.  Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventative maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our process.\n\n6.
