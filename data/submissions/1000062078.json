Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy: Cimpl Meats\r\nmaintains a comprehensive safety, health, and environmental program at the plant. The\r\nprogram includes engineering, education, and enforcement provisions for hazard\r\ncommunication, spill prevention and response, hazardous waste, universal waste and waste\r\noil management, waste water and storm water management.\r\n2. Emergency Response Program: The Cimpl Meats facility has developed an OSHA\r\nhazardous substance emergency action plan. The plan outlines specific procedures for\r\nevacuations, incident alarms and alerting. Depending upon a given situation, the Fire\r\nDepartment will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment. The Fire\r\nDepartment will be called for all fire related emergencies. The facility has communicated the\r\nhazard of ammonia with the local fire department and LEPC. The incident commander has\r\nultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\r\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: Cimpl Meats is a harvest and food processing\r\nplant located at 1000 Cattle Drive, Yankton, SD. The building houses a processing plant used\r\nfor harvest, processing, freezing, and packaging. The processed products require refrigeration\r\nfor processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. There is one\r\nMachinery Room located on the south side of the plant. This is the original ammonia\r\nrefrigeration system.\r\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst\r\ncase and alternative release scenarios for the process.\r\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five\r\nyears. However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless\r\nof ammonia quantity released into the atmosphere.\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for\r\nammonia, lists of action items were developed."
