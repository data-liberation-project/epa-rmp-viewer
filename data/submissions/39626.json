Accidental Release Prevention &\n\nEmergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGrain Processing Corporation (GPC II) uses every mean at its disposal to operate a safe workplace. This includes provisions of CFR 29 1910.119 OSHA PSM and 40 CFR part 68 EPA RMP. These are systematic approaches for chemical process hazards management designed to eliminate or minimize the potential for major catastrophes caused by the release of highly hazardous chemicals. GPC II will employ these measures to ensure that the means for preventing a catastrophic release, fire, or explosion are understood and to ensure the necessary preventative measures and lines of defense are installed and maintained. Every person onsite is included in these measures and management will ensure they are properly established and utilized.\n\n\n\nB.    Stationary Source &\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nGPC II is located in Daviess County, Indiana. The facility is a corn wet miller producing beverage and denatured alcohols, animal feed, starches, and corn syrup solids. GPC's facilities reside on 800 acres and include storage tanks and processes typical of a corn wet milling plant.\n\n\n\nB.1    Primary Plant Operations of Concern\n\n* Railcar and tank truck unloading areas.\n\n* Ethylene Oxide storage and transfer systems.\n\n* Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous) (SO2) unloading, storage and transfer system.\n\n\n\nB.2    Use of Regulated Substances\n\nEthylene Oxide\n\n* Used in the process to produce various starches.\n\n* A minimum inventory of zero is handled or stored at the facility.\n\n* A maximum inventory of 231,000 pounds (lbs) is handled or stored at the facility.\n\nSO2\n\n* Used in the corn steeping process.\n\n* A minimum inventory of 16,850 lbs is handled or stored at the facility.\n\n* A maximum inventory of 198,130 lbs is handled or stored at the facility.\n\n\n\nC.

Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nSafety committees consisting of salaried and hourly operating personnel will evaluate and implement safety recommendations as deemed prudent. In addition, plant wide safety meetings for all GPC II personnel will be conducted on a timely basis.
