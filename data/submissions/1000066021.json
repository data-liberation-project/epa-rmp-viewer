The primary purpose of this facility is to further process meat into food products for distribution to retailers.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. Ammonia as contained in equipment in the facility is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  The facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since 1999 under the PSM and RMP requirements. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.  This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental r"

Employee Participation Program: \n\nThe Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.   \n\n? Process Safety Information: \n\nAmmonia refrigeration equipment manuals and plant design technical specifications including piping diagrams are on file.  \n\n? Process Hazard Analysis: \n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was recently conducted on September 26th 2017. A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.

Five-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nThere have been two accidents as defined by EPA Risk Management in the past 5 years that have resulted in a death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\nFirst Incident: 7/2/15 - Nuisance odor complain in our decline room coming from a ceiling mounted evaporator, Due to odor an evacuation was ordered which led to an incident investigation. Upon receiving the complaint the evaporator was valved off and pumped out. During incident investigation found the evaporator coil to be in poor shape, recommended complete replacement of evaporator which was done on 10/17/2015. No injuries, property damage, deaths or environmental damaged occurred due to this incident.\n\n\n\nSecond incident: 10/22/17 - Engine Room ammonia alarm signaled high NH3 reading which triggered evacuation of employees who were on site. Alarm also triggered call to external agency (fire department). Initial response found that the leak was coming from +18 recirculator pump shaft seal. Isolated and pumped out remaining gas/liquid in suction and discharge lines of pump. Incident investigation was completed with recommendations being replace shaft seal and increase rounds for operators. Both items completed 10/26/17. No injuries, property damage, deaths or environmental damaged occurred due to this incident.\n\n \n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program \n\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.
