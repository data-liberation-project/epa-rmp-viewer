      "SummaryText": "Coal Creek Station is a lignite-fired electric generation plant, consisting of two 550MW generating units.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the cooling water process.  The maximum chlorine storage is 40,000 pounds, with an average daily disinfectant usage of 500 pounds per day.Chlorine is stored in twenty, one ton containers for use in the cooling water disinfection process.  Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the containers and injected into the suction of the circulating water pumps.  There has never been an instantaneous chlorine release in the CCS 25-year operating history.  CCS has emergency repair kits on site designed by the Chlorine Institute to contain any chlorine leak.  CCS also has a Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Team trained on chlorine response and container repair.  The cooling water process area has a continuous chlorine-monitoring device that will alarm in the facility control room in the event of a chlorine leak.  Early detection of a leak willinitiate immediate response and mitigation.  CCS has an excellent five-year history.  No chlorine gas leaks have occurred.  CCS is in compliance with the North Dakota Emergency Response Plan requirement and developed a SARA Site Specific Emergency Response Plan in September of 1992.  That plan is on file at the Local Emergency Planning Commission, State of North Dakota Director of Emergency Response, and with local fire departments.  Annually documentation of hazardous chemicals stored on site is reported to the same agencies and authorities.  CCS is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management (PSM) rules.  The PSM chlorine plan has been in place since September 1993.  The CCS HAZMAT team was organized September 1992.  This team is trained to respond to and mitigate all chlorine leaks.  All CCS employees are trained to be aware of potential chlorine leaks, or spills and to promptly report them.  The chlorine process area has continuous monitoring and alarm sy"

The HAZMAT team has standard operating procedures for response to a chlorine emergency. In addition, the plant has on-site and off-site evacuation and notification procedures.  The PSM Team meets every three years and following any incident.  Changes to procedures and/or process are implemented based upon the team's recommendation.  The team continually improves process safety and reduced the potential of a release."
