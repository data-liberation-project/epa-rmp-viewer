We will continue to utilize 3rd party consultants to inspect our facility for deficiencies in the system mechanical integrity and audit PSM compliance.  Any reported deficiencies will be corrected, in a timely manner.\nAn ammonia control system has alarm capabilities.

This scenario could affect the residential population of 940 persons who live within a 1.5 mile radius of our facility.  An active preventative maintenance program, a computer control system and trained and qualified operators and maintenance personnel significantly reduce the likelihood of such an occurrence at the facility.   \n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe Alternative Case Scenario involves the release of 1,700 pounds of"

To preserve our perishable products, we utilize an industrial refrigeration system to cool the storage areas where these items are kept. This system uses anhydrous (without water) ammonia as a refrigerant. Ammonia, a naturally occurring element, is part of the nitrogen cycle and is one of the oldest mechanical system refrigerants used. The properties that make ammonia one of the ideal industrial refrigerants for the food industry are the same ones the make it necessary to follow certain safety precautions. These precautions are designed to:\n\nProtect our neighbors and the surrounding community.\nReduce the possibility of harm to the environment.\nPrevent unnecessary human exposure\nReduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nAt the Aldi Incorporated Springfield Division Warehouse, our primary purpose is to supply our retail stores with high quality merchandise. To maintain the quality of our perishable food items we use a two-stage refrigeration system containing Anhydrous Ammonia.  The system is a closed loop system that requires no additional ammonia unless the system is expanded or if an accidental release should occur.  Access to the refrigeration system areas and equipment is restricted to our trained and authorized system operation personnel, authorized maintenance personnel, authorized management personnel, and authorized approved contractors. We observe stringent safety and operating procedures and ensure that contractors follow these policies.\n\nThe regulated substance contained at this facility is Anhydrous Ammonia.\n \n3.The General Accidental Release Prevention"
