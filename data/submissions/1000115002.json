Summary of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We have discussed this program with the Ventura County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Ventura County Fire Department. \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nThe El Rio BP was constructed in February 1998 and is in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and the United WCD's safety rules and regulations.  We continue to train and require all employees to participate in safe work practices, and to improve our operations in accordance with Federal and State safety guidelines. The facility conducts periodic inspections and studies such as Process Hazard Analysis, Compliance Audits, and Seismic Assessments to improve upon the safety of the process."

      "SummaryText": "Failure of our largest chlorine storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air, in ten minutes.  The distance to the toxic end point of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) would be 1.3 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - The manual isolation valve shearing off of the chlorine tank was chosen because it would result in a significant release, as well as being a potential outcome of the highest risk ranked item from the 2024 PHA Study. There would be chlorine gas release, and the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) would be 0.1 miles.\n\n4. Summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThis facility is designed, constructed and operated in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations.  All of our operators are state certified system operators, regularly trained and are competent to operate the process safely, in accordance with the operating procedures. As part of the implementation of the CalARP/EPA RMP Program for the Chlorination System, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by UWCD to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine for water treatment.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nThe facility\u0092s maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 16,000 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 2,500-lbs. threshold for EPA RMP, the 1,500-lbs. threshold for Cal/OSHA PSM and the 100-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the chlorine covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.1 Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.2 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\u0095\t19 CCR \u00a7 5100.3 Operating Pro"

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn the United Water Conservation District's (WCD) El Rio Booster Plant (BP), we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the USEPA.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers', and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary purpose of the El Rio BP is to pump groundwater, store, disinfect and distribute water to customers in the Cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme.  Chlorine is delivered in ton containers.  It is connected to the chlorinators to be mixed with water to make chlorine solution, then to be injected into water at several locations of the plant.  Access to the plant is restricted to authorized plant employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 16,000 pounds of chlorine kept in eight (8) one-ton containers. Chlorine leak detection and warning is provided by high and low chlorine sensor alarms to control room with an audible and visual alarm system.  \n\n3.
