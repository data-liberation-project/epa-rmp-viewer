In the event an\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), \nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on\nthe specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people\nand the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in\noperating country or terminal grain elevators\", however we are also engaged  in providing\n\"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for\ndelivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and\nreloading is # 493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  We include all crop protectents and\npetroleum products in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the\nAnhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.    \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\nthe early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The\nmaximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is\n 475,810   Lbs. The maximum on site vessel size is   30,000   Gallons, storing     130,000     Lbs.  The\nmaximum quantity handled at a given time would be "

Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, however rounding the fraction to one digit\nproduces the answer of one for item number 1.11.  Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are\ninspected  at various times of day and night throughout the year.   Time expended for these\ninspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest\nAnhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be   130,000      Lbs.  based on\n85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 4.00    miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible public\nand environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Local\nEmergency Planning Committee) for their consideration.   \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are\nprotected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and \"pull away\" valves so our alternative release\nscenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation\nequipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06  miles\n(317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements f"
