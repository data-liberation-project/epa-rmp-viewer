(PNA) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The PNA-Rossford Plant is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe Rossford, OH site previously had an RMP covered process that was shut down and decommissioned in 2009. Since then, there have been no RMP covered processes at the site. In 2024 into 2025, PNA is developing and implementing a new prevention program to support the new RMP covered process involving HF and thus is not required to include a compliance audit date in the RMP per EPA Guidance. \n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nPilkington North America, Inc. (PNA) owns and operates the PNA-Rossford site, which is a float glass manufacturing facility that produces coated glass used by the solar industry. PNA is subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules at 40 CFR 68 due to the amounts of anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, or HF, (a toxic gas) that will be present in a single process at any one time above the applicable threshold of 1,000 lbs. \n\nThe HF will be stored in two pressure barrels which will be limited to no more than 1500 lbs of anhydrous HF each. Each barrel is stored in its own containment cabinet within a HF Building separate from the main plant. Each barrel is independently connected to the process. The barrels are filled at the supplier and barrel integrity checks are performed at the supplier before being shipped to the PNA-Rossford site. Additionally, detectors are used to alarm for any potenti"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nPNA maintains a record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, PNA maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nPNA has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the covered process are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nPNA carries out documented maintenance checks"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at PNA to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at PNA. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nPNA conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nPNA promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out.
