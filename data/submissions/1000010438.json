              "Description": "Tank Farm Storage\n\nThe four processes listed under our Risk Management Plan fall under the same basic prevention program and are captured in summary under this \"Prevention Program\" section.\n\nThe four processes are as follows:\n1. Tank farm storage (which is the worst-case scenario)\n2. Isotainer metering\n3. Railcar storage\n4. Isotainer storage\n\nTank farm storage (Process #1) consists of a storage tank with railcar unloading, a forwarding pump with backpressure control and a metering pump with flow meters to measure the amount of material fed to the process.\n\nIsotainer metering (Process #2) consists of a vendor provided isotainer, a forwarding pump with backpressure control and a metering pump with flow meters to measure the amount of material fed to the process.\n\nRailcar storage (Process #3) is a process listed to define the maximum storage quantity potentially on hand without it being connected to the process.  Typically a railcar would be arrive on site and would be offloaded when the storage tank in Process #1 was at a low enough level to offload.  \n\nIsotainer storage (Process #4) is a process listed to define the maximum storage quantity in isotainer mode of transportation without it being connected to the process.  Typically a secondary isotainer would be staged on-site until the isotainer in Process #2 was consumed and the process shut down and the isotainer switched.\n\nThe only exceptions are listed below:\n7.4d.  Under Process Hazard Analysis, overfilling does not apply to Processes #2, #3 & #4 as Dow does not fill the isotainer or railcar nor does over pressurization apply to Process #2 or #4 as isotainers are not pressurized by Dow.\n7.4e.  Processes #3 & #4 do not have automatic shutoffs or alarms as these are transportation vessels.\n7.4f.  Processes #3 & #4 do not have diking when not connected to the process.\n7.4g.  Processes #3 and #4 do not have process area detectors in place to monitor an unconnected transportation vessel.",

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained personnel are at hand to initiate Immediate Response to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Jefferson County Emergency Planning Committee and the Dunklin Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response expertise and response.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Dow Chemical Riverside SiteA?s primary activity encompasses Extruded Polystyrene Foam Production.  One RMP-regulated flammable substance is handled and stored above threshold quantities at the facility, 1,1-Difluroethane (also known as HFC-152a), which is used as a blowing agent for extruded polystyrene foam production.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Riverside Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Riverside SiteA?s general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHAA?s PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System.  Key elements include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment desi"

Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined),  Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Riverside Site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.
