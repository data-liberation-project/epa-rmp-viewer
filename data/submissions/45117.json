Paramount Chemicals & Plastics, Inc. sells chemicals, including Chlorine Gas, to water and wastewater treatment plants, farms, nurseries, and other retail customers.  \n\nGaseous chlorine is delivered to the plant in 150-pound cylinders.  Paramount Chemicals & Plastics, Inc. typically has twenty (20) to forty (40) 150-pound cylinders on the premises at any given time (approximately 3000 to 6000 pounds).  Cylinders are stored on site inside of the main warehouse.  Cylinders are chained to the wall, where they remain until they are sold and loaded on a truck for delivery to the customer.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario implemented in this RMP is breaking off the valve stem of a 150-pound chlorine cylinder while loading or unloading trucks.  The worst-case gas release discussed in this RMP is unlikely because cylinders are stored with caps on and operating procedures are in place and followed for safe loading and unloading of cylinders.  \n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative case release scenario discussed in this RMP is a gas leak from accidental puncture of the cylinder with a forklift.  This scenario is unlikely because cylinders are chained to the wall and stored in an area of the warehouse where forklift traffic is minimal.  All staff are trained to handle cylinders by hand or with a hand-truck whenever possible versus using a forklift.   \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nParamount Chemicals & Plastics, Inc. has not had an accidental release in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nParamount Chemicals & Plastics, Inc. Staff will respond and correct small controllable chlorine leaks ONLY.\n\nSmall c"
