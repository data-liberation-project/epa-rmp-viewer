There is an already permitted bulk grain distribution and animal feed manufacturing plant, owned by Arizona Grain, adjacent to the location where the ethanol plant is built.  Arizona Grain will supply the corn utilized for ethanol production at Pinal.  \n   \nPinal plans to begin operations at the ethanol plant in the next month. Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed, and much of the training has been ongoing.  Given that Pinal is a new facility, there have been periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information maintained at the facility to date. \n \nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nPinal is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and testing, safety and compliance audits, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nPinal\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  This containment area is equipped with seven foot walls and a fire suppression foam cannon system. The foam suppression system is also connected to and runs to the top of each tank.  During an incident the cannon would externally coat the tanks, while the pipe connecting to each tank would flood the tank internally.  A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire would be quickly extinguished.  Pinal has an emergency response contact on-call and a Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP).  T"

      "SummaryText": "heir HMMP is coordinated by the Maricopa Fire Department and includes written emergency response procedures. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Pinal ethanol plant is located near Maricopa, Pinal County, Arizona.\n\nThe facility will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program include denaturant (natural gasoline), which is considered a flammable mixture.  Pinal has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case flammable release would be approximately 0.7 miles.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all the contents from the denaturant tank and gasoline constituents in the denatured ethanol tanks (624,169 lbs of flammable mixture) creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.7 miles from the center of the plant.  Two public receptors are located within this 0.7 mile radius.  The main office of Arizona Grain, which employs eight people, is located approximately 600 feet away.  Also, a cattle company, which employs five people, is located 800 feet southeast of the plant.  The City of Maricopa is located about 4 miles from the facility and outside the area of impact. \n \nAlthough the Pinal ethanol plant has numerous controls in place to prevent a flammable release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating the worst-case and alternative scenarios.\n\nThe facility qualifies for Program 2 for denaturant since public receptors could be impacted by a worst-case release. The facility is not subject to OSHA\u00bfs Program Safety Management requirements that would trigger Program 3. \n\nSince the facility qualifies for Program 2, an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was required for the flammable constituents of the denaturant.

The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility.  Both public receptors would still be affected.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nPinal has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite. There have been no accidents at this time.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Pinal facility has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a HMMP.  An SPCC Plan will also be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes. \n\nPinal conducts regular employee training as part of facility activities.  Employees are involved in on the job and classroom training programs and are tested using written and demonstration methods. The Pinal corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
