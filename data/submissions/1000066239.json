The facility is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40CFR 68.10(b)(1). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact identified in the RMP.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Bob West Dew Point plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of proced"

      "SummaryText": "ures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process. Personnel are informed of and trained in any changes to the emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response plan for the plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Bob West Dew Point plant has effective communications capability with LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department). This communication provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the facility conducts periodic emergency drills.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nContinued focus on Mechanical Integrity inspections for all pressure vessels, piping, rotating equipment and control devices to ensure no loss of containment."
