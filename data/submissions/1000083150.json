The Gurnee facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan. \n\n\n\n<> The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nRAI owns, operates, and controls hydrogen handling equipment (piping, valves, etc.) that is interconnected with a hydrogen storage system with a capacity greater than 10,000 pounds. The hydrogen storage system is owned, operated, and controlled by Praxair, Inc. (Praxair) and RAI has no access to the storage system. More specifically, Praxair's storage system is located on the RAI site and is inside a fenced area to which RAI does not have access. Piping from the hydrogen storage system passes across the chain link fence and into RAI's process.\n\n\n\n<> The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nRAI is responsible for all components of the covered process that are outside of the Praxair compound. Praxair is responsible to RAI for all components of the covered process inside the Praxair compound. The Gurnee facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations. The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n\n\n - Employee Participation\n\n - Process Safety Information\n\n "
