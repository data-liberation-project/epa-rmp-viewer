Hose Rupture (partial)  Event Sequence and Consequences  Release rate is set below excess flow valve set point.  Results in continuous release.  Potential Mitigating Action  Protect hoses from damage.  Clean hoses when necessary.  Replace hoses when necessary/required.  Install cable release quick shut-off valves.  What If?  Hose Rupture (complete)  Event Sequence and Consequences  Release rate exceeds excess flow valve setting.  Results in short, high quantity release.

Valve Failure (complete)  Event Sequence and Consequences  Continuous release of NH3 from failed valve resulting from complete failure of a valve or a pressure release valve (PRV).  Potential Mitigating Action  Assure only NH3 valves are installed.  Install PRV manifold allowing PRV's to be replaced without emptying NH3 tank.  What If?  Overfilled Tank (PRV Release)  Event Sequence and Consequences  Continuous release of NH3 vapor.  Potential Mitigating Action  Use 85% spitter gauge when filling tank.  Train employees not to overfill tank.  What If?  Overfilled Tank (Tank Rupture)  Event Sequence and Consequences  Complete loss of NH3 resulting from over pressurization and damaged tank.  Potential Mitigating Action  Use 85% spitter gauge when filling tank.  Train employees not to overfill tank  What If?  Tanker pulls away before hoses are disconnected.  Event Sequence and Consequences  Hoses rupture and/or valves are damaged.  Release rate will decrease as tank pressure drops.  Potential Mitigating Action  A facility employee should monitor the NH3 transfer process.  Tanker wheels should be chocked before transfer operation begins and removed only after all hoses have been disconnected.  What If?  Physical damage to valves, hoses, and piping  Event Sequence and Consequences  Continuous release of vapor or liquid from damaged equipment.  Potential Mitigating Action  Install safety barriers (bumper poles) to protect equipment from damage.  What If?  Valves are not properly closed  Event Sequence and Consequences  Continuous low quantity release from valve that is not properly closed (i.e., ice on valve seat).  Potential Mitigating Action  Shut valves with sufficient torque to seat properly.  What If?  Corrosion of piping  Event Sequence and Consequences  Continuous low quantity release from a pin hole.  Potential Mitigating Action  Include piping system in preventative maintenance program.  What If?  Vandalism  Event Sequence and Consequences  Release of NH3 from a valve opened by a vandal.  Potential Mitigating Action  Install valve locks and/or security fence.  What If?  Earthquake  Event Sequence and Consequences  Damage to valves, piping, or tank.  Potential Mitigating Action  Make improvements as necessary to reduce risk of damage.  What If?  Flooding  Event Sequence and Consequences  Flood water could damage compressor and hydrostatic pressure relief valves.  Potential Mitigating Action  Inspect entire system after flood waters have receded.  Assure that the entire system is functional and free of water.  What If?  Traffic Accident  Event Sequence and Consequences  Damage to piping or valves from vehicle impact.  Potential Mitigating Action  Install safety barriers (bumper poles) to protect equipment from damage.",

If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nA description of our facility and any regulated substances handled:\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 121503 pounds in our two storage tanks.\n\nThe worst case scenario and alternative release scenario:\n    The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 121503 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\n    The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incidents is a release from a break in a transfer hose, a pipe leak, overfilling, or an excess flow valve failure.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program:\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past"
