This GSPM facility has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\n(e)\tEmergency Response Program. GSPM has developed an Emergency Response Plan to provide our employees with a plan of action for responding to emergency situations at our facilities.  The plan ensures the following:\n\na.\tprompt receipt of calls and forwarding of emergency messages to designated personnel 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.\nb.\tPrompt and effective response to emergency situations, with actions taken to protect people, environment, assets, and property.\nc.\tSafe and rapid restoration of service to customers.\nd.\tEffective investigation of failures and incidents.\n\n(f)\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  The Silver Lake plant was shut down during the 1st quarter of 2023 and it has remained off-line since that time.  As part of our planned restarting of the plant in late Q4 2023 or Q1 2024 we intend to complete PSSR and PHA activities.  We also intend to review and revise as necessary our emergency planning and employee training program to facilitate the re-starting of the plant."

Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Great Salt Plains Midstream, LLC (GSPM).  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all GSPM facilities.  Our facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  GSPM facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (i.e.: pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.:  police department, fire department, etc.).\n\n(b)\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The GSPM facility is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substances at the facility include flammable chemical mixtures and individual chemicals.  Chemicals include natural gas liquids (NGL), an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture consisting of N-pentane, iso-pentane, N-butane, iso-butane, propane, butane, methane, and ethane.  The chemicals on site have an RMP regulated flammable mixture threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds or greater.  .\n\n\n(c)\tOffsite Consequences Analysis.  GSPM has performed offsite consequences analysis (OCA) including worst case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS) ranging from the catastrophic to more likely events.  Based on the results of these analyses, the number of potential receptors, if any, were identified.  To minimize offsite consequences, various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limi"
