Future plans include piping upgrades to reduce the likelihood of corrosion and improve the mechanical integrity of the ammonia system.  Sargento also benchmarks to ensure the highest standards of risk and liability mitigation.  Per the recently released IIAR9-2020 standard, Sargento has audited our ammonia refrigeration system and is actively incorporating recommendations to improve the system safeties of our refrigeration system. In 2022, Sargento created a corporate compliance department to help interpret regulations and provide guidance regarding keeping our facilities and local communities safe.  We continue to maintain good relationships with local emergency response agencies and are planning joint exercises with them in the near future."

Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training for all employees. Sargento maintenance employees are trained on operation of the ammonia system and perform system walk-throughs and operating checks during each working day. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan.  The program requirements under the RMP and PSM programs are similar, and include safety information, hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits and contractor management. Both programs require a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The most recent PHA was conducted in October 2022. In addition, the RMP program includes an offsite consequence analysis, a management system, and emergency response planning.\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, the local fire and hazardous response team would be notified, and the emergency response procedures would be followed. Sargento has retained Bassett Mechanical (Kaukauna, Wisconsin) to respond to a release or an emergency. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, and employees regularly train on use of the plan. Emergency drills covering various emergency types are conducted several times each year. Sargento strives to have at least one drill each year that involves an ammonia-related emergency. Sargento works closely with the Calumet County LEPC which would coordinates emergency response for the local community.\n\nIn the past five years, Sargento has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.

      "SummaryText": "Sargento\u2019s Hilbert, Wisconsin location is a dairy processing plant with modern capabilities that was constructed in 1979.  The facilities produce packaged cheese snacks and cheese sticks. A 2008 building addition included the facility's initial ammonia refrigeration system. The north production building was added in 2016, subsequently expanded in 2018 and again in 2022-2024.  Finally, the south production facility was also expanded in 2020. The facilities occupy 285,000 sqft. and the property is located on 24.4 acres on the southern outskirts of the Village of Hilbert. Adjacent properties to the east and south are farmland. Residential properties are located to the north. A mixture of residential and commercial (St. Vincent De Paul and Frontier) are located to the west, across STH 32/57.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapter COMM 45 (replaced by Chapter SPS 345: Mechanical Refrigeration System in December 2011) and ASHRAE and IIAR standards. The system is a basic single-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The inventory of ammonia within the refrigeration system is ~15,000 pounds. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which continually monitor the refrigeration system. \n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento\u2019s -Hilbert facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Sargento has incorporated ammonia into its Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) per OSHA standard 1910.119, which details system operation management and accident prevention programs. The PSM program will be audited every three years. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) will be conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. The facility is also required to comply with EPA\u2019s Risk Management Program (RMP). The RMP rule, found in 40CFR68, uses a tiered approach for its risk management requirements.  Sargento"
