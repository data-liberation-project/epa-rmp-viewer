      "SummaryText": "Farmers Union Co-op Assn of McCook Co. is a registered Anhydrous Ammonia dealer. We have a 30,000 gallon and a 18,000 gallon storage tank located on east Walker Street on the east edge of Montrose, SD. Anhydrous ammonia is a nitrogen source of fertilizer for the enhancement of plant growth. Our company has not had an accidental release of ammonia in the last five years. We train our employees in the safe transfer of ammonia and have a maintenance program in place to prevent equipment failure. Our facilities are inspected by the State of South Dakota on an annual basis plus our insurance loss control person periodically inspects our tanks and equipment. The recommendations are immediately corrected. Our Risk Management Plan was completed using government and industry standards for the accidental release and the alternative release scenarios. We have an Emergency Action Plan in force coordinated with the Montrose fire department and the Local Emergency Action Plan Committee in conjuction with the McCook Co. Civil Defense in Salem, SD. We continue looking for areas to improve the safety in the transfer of ammonia and will upgrade facilities and equipment as needed."
