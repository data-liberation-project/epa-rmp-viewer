The Plasti-kote Medina facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Action Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental release. \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Plasti-kote Medina Facility manufactures and stores aerosol paints, protective coatings, lubricants and specialty items for the automotive, home, and industrial users.  The manufacturing process uses propane and dimethyl ether as raw materials used as propellant for aerosol paints.  The facility stores propane in a 30,000 gallon steel, pressure resistant tank and dimethyl ether in a 9,600 gallon steel, pressure resistant tank. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n\nAs required by the RMP regulation, the worst case release scenario was calculated by assuming the entire contents of the largest container were released for both propane and dimethyl ether.  A loss of the contents of the largest storage tank for each material was chosen. The scenarios are very unlikely due to the design of the storage tanks.  According to EPA guidance for calculating the consequence of a propane release, the distance to endpoint for the release of 110,000 pounds was calculated to be  .4 miles. The EPA has determined that propane does not pose a threat to the public beyond this distance.  There are public receptors located within this distance.\n\nAccording to EPA guidance for calculating the consequence of a dimethyl ether release, the distance to endpoint for the release of 68,000 pounds was calculated to be .3 miles. The EPA has determined that dimethyl ether does not pose a threat to the public beyond this distance.  There are public receptors located within this distance.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nA more likely release scenario for propane would"

According to EPA guidance for calculating the consequence of a propane release, the distance to endpoint was calculated to be .06 miles or 316 feet.  There are no residential receptors located within this distance.\n\nA more likely release scenario for dimethyl ether would be a release of 1,275 pounds from a hole in the process piping.  According to EPA guidance for calculating the consequence of a dimethyl ether release, the distance to endpoint was calculated to be .04 miles, or 211 feet.  There are no residential receptors located within this distance.\n\n  \nGeneral Accidental Release and Chemical Specific Prevention Programs:\n\nThe Medina Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA's accident prevention rule.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment.   Numerous safeguards are in place and include operational procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industry practices.  The facility uses both procedural as well as technological systems to ensure safe handling of propane and dimethyl ether.  The transfer system is engineered to prevent propane and dimethyl ether from leaking. \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe Medina Facility has never had an accident involving propane or dimethyl ether that resulted in injuries, property damage or environmental releases.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving propane or dimethyl ether , we will immediately notify the Medina Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation.  The fire department has a well-trained response team.  City of Medina agencies, including the Medina Fire Department, inspect the facility on a regular basis and are familiar with ou"
