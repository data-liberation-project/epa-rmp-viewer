Fifteen processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week.  Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest US grain companies.  In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, and livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe Perdue Farms Monterey facility is located in Putnam County, Tennessee, east of the town of Monterey.  The facility is a poultry further processing plant which employs approximately 1900 associates to receive chicken and turkey meat plus other raw ingredients to form, prepare and package for distribution to the market place.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance at the Monterey facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as integral part of its refrigeration system, which consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the processing plant in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total system capacity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 135,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.
