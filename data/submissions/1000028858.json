      "SummaryText": "rmance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\r\n\r\nF. Contractors\r\n\r\nNuevo uses Contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some Contractors work on or near covered process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that Contractors:\r\n\r\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\r\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\r\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\r\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\r\n5. Understand and follow site safety rules\r\n6. Inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing Contractors with:\r\n\r\n1. A process overview\r\n2. Information about safety and health hazards\r\n3. Emergency response plan requirements\r\n4. Safe work practices before beginning work\r\n\r\nIn addition, Nuevo Management will evaluate the Contractor safety program and performance during the selection of a Contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor Contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nG. Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nNuevo conducts a PSSR for any new facility modification that requires a change in the Process Safety Information.

The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Petroleum condensates are transported onward to another facility for processing.\r\n\r\nNuevo and the Ramsey Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Ramsey Gas Plant is located near Orla, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products from raw natural gas:\r\n1. Natural Gas Liquid Product (Y-Grade, Ethane-plus)\r\n2. Condensate \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nA. Employee Participation\r\n\r\nNuevo encourages employees to participate in all facets of Process Safety Management and accident prevention as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\r\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\r\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\r\n4.

Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\r\n\r\nThe location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM Manual/Files.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nC.

The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nD. Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nNuevo maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate, revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, PHA's, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and Management of Change.\r\n\r\nCovered process Operating Procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\r\n\r\nE.

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.\r\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate. Nuevo has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, Nuevo conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel.\r\n\r\nNuevo's management is committed to the following:\r\n\r\n-Preventing accidents;\r\n-Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\r\n-Participating in community emergency preparedness;\r\n-Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Nuevo operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents\r\n\r\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the natural gas treatment and liquids recovery process. Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
