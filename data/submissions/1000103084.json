The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLayton Bakery currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Layton Bakery personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
