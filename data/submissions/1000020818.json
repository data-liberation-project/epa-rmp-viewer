The liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel (to be reused in the evaporators) and the vapor is drawn from the top by the compressors.\n\nThere are three screw compressors (HS-4, HS-5, and HS-6) in the refrigeration system.  Compressor HS-6 draws vapor from the -40F Recirculator and the +15F Economizer, and HS-4 and HS-5 draw vapor from the -20F Recirculator and economizer suction from the +15F Economizer.  In addition, HS-4 has the capacity to draw vapor from the -40F Recirculator.  The pressure of the vapor is increased and then it is discharged through a common header to the Condensers, where the vapor is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained back to the Thermosphon/High Pressure Receiver.  Compressor discharge (hot-gas) is also used for defrost of the evaporators.  \n\nAn Auto Purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the Condensers.

The High Pressure Receiver also provides liquid ammonia to the compressors for liquid injection oil cooling.  As the ammonia enters the +15F Recirculator, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal pressure.  The +15F Recirculator vessel pumps liquid ammonia to the dock (5) and cold storage evaporators (2).

The facility employs two independent refrigeration systems that contain approximately 9,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia each, as a refrigerant within a closed system.  However, the two systems' combined inventory, 18,000 pounds, exceeds 10,000 pounds and the systems are being considered as 'co-located' processes for the purposes of the Risk Management Plan regulation.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations and cooler/freezer storage.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 8Hg on the low pressure side of the systems to 165 psig on the high side. \n\nOld System\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon/High Pressure Receiver to the +15F Economizer and -40F Recirculator.  The liquid is subcooled in the +15\u00c2\u00bfaF Economizer as it flows through coils immersed in a bath of the liquid ammonia within the vessel.  The subcooled liquid ammonia is routed to evaporators in the Convertible Rooms, Dock, and Storage areas.  Liquid ammonia from the bath in the +15F Economizer is fed to the -20F Recirculator.

The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are the designated emergency commanders for the facility.   Arctic Cold Storage has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nArctic Cold Storage has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Arctic Cold Storage to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\nArctic Cold Storage is located at 4139 Roosevelt Road, in St. Cloud, Minnesota.  The facility is approximately 0.45 miles north of Interstate 94, approximately 3.9 miles east of Highway 15, and approximately 50 feet east of Co. Rd. 75.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light commercial and industrial areas.

At the -20F Recirculator, the ammonia is further expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature).  The -20F Recirculator vessel pumps liquid ammonia to the freezers (6) and the resulting two-phased (liquid/vapor) ammonia is returned to the same vessel.

All three of the compressors are screw-type compressors which pull vapor from the vessels and discharge through a common header to the Condenser where the vapor is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained back to the High Pressure Receiver.

The PHA was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the ammonia refrigeration system since the 2006 PHA, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 2006 Process Hazard Analysis and the 2009 PSM/RMP Three-Year Compliance Audit, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, completion of industry checklists, a site inspection to review the piping diagrams, review of the worst case and alternative case release scenarios, and review of the RMP*Submit.  The recommended changes from the PHA Revalidation study are scheduled to be completed by February 2012.\n\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for Arctic Cold Storage employees in St. Cloud, Minnesota.
