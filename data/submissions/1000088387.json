Northeast provides potable water to the City of Abilene (City), as well as to wholesale customers supplied through neighboring communities and water supply corporations.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at Northeast.  Up to 24,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at Northeast.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Northeast is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Director of Water Utilities (Director) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction w"

      "SummaryText": "ith on-the-job training to ensure that certified Water Treatment Plant (WTP) operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Prevention Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews, and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nNortheast complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and the Texas Administrative Code.  Northeast is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The City's Office of Emergency Management maintains a community-wide emergency response plan (ERP) which includes Northeast. WTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via 9-1-1 in the event of a release from Northeast. The City's Fire Department serves as the first responder and coordinates the emergency response according to the City's ERP, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.90(b)). Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with ?68.93 with the first responders (the City of Abilene Fire Department), the local emergency planners (City of Abilene Office of Emergency Management), and the Taylor County Local Emergency Planning "
