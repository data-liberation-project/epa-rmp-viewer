This commitment is demonstrated by the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes and by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs.\r\n\r\n1.2\tDescription Of The Facility And Regulated Substances\r\nThe Redcliff Gas Plant is a 200 MMSCFD cryogenic gas plant. Natural gas enters the plant at 1000 psig and any liquid that condensed in the inlet pipelines, known as condensate, is separated using a Harp-style slug catcher.\r\nLiquid from the Harp is processed in a condensate stabilization unit to produce a stabilized condensate and Y-grade NGL product. Process gas from the Harp is treated to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water prior to entering the Cryo Plant.\r\nThe Cryo Plant is a gas subcooled process (GSP) with refrigeration in which gas is initially cooled using heat integration/recovery from a series of heat exchangers. Use of a turboexpander and reflux exchanger enables the process temperature to be reduced to as low as -150 \u00b0F. A Demethanizer splits the gas into a liquefied Y-Grade NGL product stream containing nearly all ethane and heavier components while simultaneously distilling the product to remove all residual methane which is rejected out of the tower to be sold as sales gas. The NGL stream is pumped to pipeline pressure and marketed to interstate pipelines. The residue gas stream is compressed, filtered, and delivered to transmission lines and sold as sales gas.\r\n\r\nThe listed flammable substances over the threshold of the 40 CFR Part 68 at the Redcliff Midstream facility are: Butane, Ethane, i-Butane, i-Pentane, Methane, n-Pentane and"
