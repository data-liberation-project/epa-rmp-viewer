The RMP for this facility has been updated to meet the 5 year update requirement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Updated changes to the 1999 RMP include: 1) the requirement that information on reportable chemical accidents be added to the RMP within 6 months of the accident date; 2) the requirement that changes to the emergency contact information be reported within 1 month; 3) the removal of the original requirement to include a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the Executive Summary of the RMP; and 4) the addition of 3 data elements to the RMP consisting of; a) emergency contact e-mail addresses if the addresses exist; b) the purpose and type of any submission that revises or otherwise affects the previously filed RMP; and c) the name, address, and telephone number of the contractor/consultant who prepared the updated RMP.\n\n\nMonroe Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Monroe Water Treatment Plant (Monroe WTP) treats approximately 13 million gallons daily of drinking water for the City of Bloomington.  The processes at the plant include mixing, sedimentation control, filtration, and chlorination  of water supplied from the nearby Monroe Reservoir.  The water chlorination process uses gaseous phase chorine.  The only regulated substance used at the plant is chlorine.  The facility purchases pressurized cylinders that are filled with 2,000 pounds of liquified chlorine.  A total of 10,000 pounds of chlorine could be stored at the plant at any one time.\n\n\nAccidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Monroe WTP is covered by the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know  (EPCRA) program and the OSHA Process Management Plan requirements.  The only substance representing a hazard to humans and the environmental is the potential toxic release of chlorine gas.   Potent"

      "SummaryText": "ial releases of chlorine gas could occur from pressurized cylinders damaged during unloading and potential release from material failure of the vacuum relief valve on each gas cylinder.  The facility has the following process controls in place to reduce the risk of chlorine gas:  relief valves, manual shutfoff controls, automatic shutoffs, gas detection alarms, and rupture disks.  When the outer access doors to the gas cylinder storage room are closed, the chlorine storage building provides significant passive control and mitigation of gas escape from the facility.  Pursant to U.S. EPA guidance, the storage building is assumed to reduce the rate of chlorine gas release to the environment by approximately 55%.    Chlorine leaks can be detected through the use of chlorine gas sensors within the chlorine storage room area and in the chlorination process room.\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Bloomington has a strong committment to the protection of the public and environment from releases of hazardous chemicals from any of its facilities.  The individual facility managers are responsible for safe operating and maintenance of all potentially hazardous treatment processes as well as the enforcement of emergency response policies.  Guidance and policies for the handling of accidental releases of hazardous substances at its facilities is provided by: 1) a Process Safety Management Plan (June 1999); and a  2) Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (under the direction of the Monroe County LEPC).  All personnel that work with facilities process equipment using hazardous substances, receive training in safety and emergency response procedures.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Plant Superintendent of the Monroe WTP has stated that the facility has not had any reportable releases of chlorine gas during the past 5 years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Monroe WTP is included in the Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan as prepared by the Monroe"

The Monroe WTP plans call for the water chlorination process to switch from using chlorine gas to the use of bleach treatment within the next year."
