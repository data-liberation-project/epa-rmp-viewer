SAWS, a public utility owned by The City of San Antonio was created in May 1992, and is responsible for treating drinking water and wastewater. SAWS also owns and operates, as a separate utility, a chilled water and steam plant which is a centralized heating and cooling system for the buildings in and around HemisFair Park.\r\n\r\nA seven member Board of Trustees, appointed by the City Council, governs SAWS. The Mayor appoints the Chair each year and the board elects the vice-chair and secretary. In 2010, the San Antonio Water System served approximately 1.65 million people in the urbanized part of Bexar County. This population includes approximately 417,000 separate customers.\r\n\r\nSAWS has won awards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its compliance with strict effluent discharge regulations. Treated wastewater effluent is the principal water supply for Braunig and Calaveras Lakes, the two power plant cooling lakes operated by City Public Service. SAWS is has also developed the facilities to distribute treated wastewater as a substitute for aquifer water in park and golf course irrigation and industrial uses and to supplement flows in the San Antonio River and Salado Creek.\r\n\r\nSAWS takes pride in observing the most stringent industrial safety precautions in preventing chemical related accidents. The latest safety technology monitoring detection systems are used at the Dos Rios facility. Internal inspections and inspection by staff from the Texas Commission Environmental Quality and EPA are conducted on a routine basis.\r\n\r\nAn active mitigation system is incorporated into the operation and maintenance of chemical handling systems at Dos Rios. This system is a dry Activated Carbon Gas Adsorption System and was completed and\r\naccepted in 2010. Our goal is to first prevent accidental releases and second to defuse the impact of an accidental spillage, fire, or"

      "SummaryText": "explosion if it should occur. \r\n\r\nThe SAWS Treatment Group. which operates the Dos Rios WRC, is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the System's three other major wastewater treatment plants. These plants treat an average\r\nof 130 million gallons of wastewater per day and have a total capacity (including an excess margin required by state regulators) of 225 million gallons per day. Regulated materials used in the treatment process include chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nLike other water utilities in the state, the Dos Rios WRC is required to disinfect treated effluent prior to discharge to ensure that disease causing bacteria (pathogens) are reduced to a safe level. Chlorine is a widely used disinfectant in the wastewater industry because it is effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens. Chlorine has shown itself to be an effective agent against waterborne bacteria, viruses and most protozoan agents. Sulfur dioxide is used to remove chlorine in wastewater prior to stream discharge to reduce aquatic toxicity.\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis has been performed for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide using EPA'S RMP*Comp calculations for offsite consequence analysis. Assuming a complete rupture of containers, off-site receptors would be impacted. Because all storage containers used by SAWS must conform to stringent Department of Transportation (DOT) construction standards the occurrence of a worst case release is not realistic. Information from the hazard analysis is used to improve emergency planning activities with the San Antonio Fire Department and the Bexar County LEPC. An analysis of three more likely alternative releases showed that Chlorine or Sulfur dioxide would not normally be expected to extend beyond property lines.\r\n\r\nChlorine shipping containers are designed for safety. U.S. Department of Transportation regulations at 49 CFR 173.304 set the maximum permissible density of chlorine in the container to 125 percent of the ratio of the weight"

Chlorine valves are protected either by protective housing (cylinders) or manhole cover (tank). In the event of a fire or temperatures exceeding 165 degrees farenheit, the fusible plugs on chlorine melt to\r\nrelieve pressure. Ton chlorine containers are designed to withstand pressures of at least 330 psig. Emergency repair kits are available and detectors and alarms are operable.\r\n\r\nA chemical safety management plan for accident prevention which documents employee training, operation and maintenance procedures and emergency preparedness, is maintained and is on file at the facility's\r\nadministrative building. All personnel handling regulated chemicals at Dos Rios are required to be TCEQ Certified operators and receive training in the safe use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Training exercises are routinely held at the facility.\r\n\r\nA procedure is in place to investigate and report any accidental release or near miss event. Lessons learnedand findings from these investigations are immediately incorporated into the accident prevention plan. The regulated chemical safety management plan is reviewed and updated each year during the facility's Tier II\r\nsubmittal process. A copy of this RMP has been provided to the San Antonio Fire Department and the Bexar County LEPC."
