As a responsible member of the local community, it is the City of Austin's desire to minimize the risks posed by the WWTF.  To this end, the City of Austin submits it's Risk Management Plan to communicate with the public and responders and to assist in the preservation of public safety and environmental protection.\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility:\n\nIt is the policy of City of Austin WWTF to provide employees with a work place free of recognized health and safety hazards in an effort to conserve our human, physical and financial resources.  The health and well-being of all personnel is important.  It is our policy that everything within reason shall be done to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for all employees.  \n \nEach employee has a place in our accident prevention program and is expected to cooperate fully in all measures taken in loss prevention.  The ultimate goal of the health and safety program is to prevent and reduce employee injuries and illnesses through the administration of an effective health and safety program.  Elements of this program are:\n\n \tMaintenance of safe and healthful working conditions.\n \tEnsuring employee adherence to proper operating practices and procedures designed to prevent injuries and illness.\n \tObserving and applying Federal, State, and Local safety regulations.\n \tEach employee is properly trained and instructed on job procedures prior to job \tassignments.\n \tProviding safety meetings for all employees as a means of obtaining new and updated information and training.\n \tConducting periodic safety and fire inspections to identify potential hazards in the work"

When engineering controls are infeasible or fail to completely control the hazards, administrative controls will be used to minimize employee exposure.  When these types of controls fail, appropriate Personal Protective Equipment will be issued and employees will be trained in its proper use and required to wear it.\n\nEmployees are required to read all safety rules and to know and follow them. A copy of the safety rules is given to each employee.  New employees receive a copy upon hire. Employees are asked to sign an acknowledgment card which states that they have read the safety rules and understand them. This card is kept in the employee personnel file.\n\nUpon initial assignment to a job, employees will be trained in the chemical hazards of the work and appropriate safe work practices and personal protective measures to be employed as per the Minnesota Employee Right-to-Know act.  This initial training will be provided by the Program Coordinator.  The level of training is relevant to the employee's role and responsibilities and is directed at protecting the employee and the environment.\n\n\nOur  Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe City operates two separate treatment plants.  The City was awarded the Environmental Protection Agency's 1989 National Award of Excellence for outstanding operation and maintenance.  Clean water has always been a priority for the City of Austin.  \n\nThe City's sanitary sewer system dates back to 1904.  The Domestic plant was constructed in 1925 and has been through five upgrades.  The Industrial plant was constructed in 1958 and has been expanded three times.  \n\nTwo treatment plants serve the residents and businesses of Austin.

Beginning with primary treatment in the early 10\u00bf`s this plant has been upgraded five times to keep pace with the ever changing regulatory requirements and the increase growth in the City.  This facility is operating at better than 90% efficiency and is currently operating at 75% of design capacity.\n\nThe industrial plant was constructed in 1958 to treat the industrial strength wastewater from the George A. Hormel & Company.  This facility uses a unique treatment process to remove the high amounts of organic and solid matter in the wastewater.  This facility is operating a t better than 90% efficiency and is currently operating at 70% of design capacity.  \n\nINDUSTRIAL PLANT\nWastewater Treatment Process\n\nPreliminary Treatment \nWastewater at the Hormel Foods Corporation goes through a pretreatment system which is designed to remove organic matter and solids.  A lift station pumps an average of 1.8 million gallons per day of wastewater to flow equalization tanks/digesters at the Industrial Plant where the wastewater is stored and treatment begins.\n\nAnaerobic Contact Stabilization\n\nFour million gallon anaerobic digesters biologically reduce organic matter and solids by bacterial action and mixing.  This process produces high volumes of methane gas which is used as fuel in the boiler to heat the digesters.\n\n90% of the organic matter and 80% of the solids are reduced in this process.  The treated wastewater flows to an aeration tank which strips the methane gas from the liquid prior to flowing into four solids separators.  The settled solids (sludge) are returned to the digesters for more treatment.\n\nDOMESTIC TREATMENT PANT\nWastewater Treatment Process\n\nPreliminary Treatment\nA main pump station pumps an average of 3.5 million gallons per day of wastewater to the aerated grit chamber.  Rags and grit are removed in this process area to improve treatability of the wastewater.  A flow equalization tank is utilized to store and distr"

The solids settle and are pumped as \"sludge\" to the anaerobic digesters.  The sludge is biologically stabilized before being land applied on area farmland.\n\nSecondary Treatment (High Rate Filters)\nFour trickling filters biologically remove 85% of the organic matter present in wastewater.  The bacteria consume the organic matter in the wastewater as it trickles over 8 feet of rock media.  The treated wastewater flows to intermediate clarifiers for suspended solids removal.\n\nSecondary Treatment (Clarification)\nTwo final clarifiers remove the remaining suspended solids.  These solids are recirculated to the primary treatment area.\n\nCOMBINED PROCESSES\nThe effluents of both plants are combined for nitrification and disinfection.\n\nNitrification\n A nitrification trickling filter biologically removes ammonia nitrogen from wastewater.  Wastewater is sprayed over plastic media that is inhabited by bacteria.  Ammonia specific bacteria remove ammonia from wastewater before final clarifiers for more solids removal\n\nDisinfection\nThe treated effluent from both plants is disinfected.  Wastewater enters the Chlorine Contact Tank where chlorination begins.  The chlorine utilized in the chlorination process is contained in one-ton pressurized cylinders which are stored in the Chlorination Building.  Here the chlorine is mixed as a solution and introduced to the wastewater at the \"front-end\" of the Chlorine Contact Tank.  The maximum quantity of chlorine on-site at any one time is five cylinders, or 10,000 pounds.  \n\nDechlorination occurs at the \"back-end\" of the Chlorine Contact Tank prior to the wastewater's discharge to the Cedar River.
