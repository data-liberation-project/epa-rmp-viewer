      "SummaryText": "Gold Kist Inc., Live Oak Processing Facility is strongly committed to employee and public safety and protection of the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program covering design, installation, operating prodecures, maintenance and employee training associated with the covered processes at the Facility. Gold Kist implements appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  In the event a release does occur, the Facility's emergency response personnel respond to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Gold Kist also coordinates with the Live Oak Fire Department and the regional response team of the North Central Florida Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nThe Facility's primary activity is poultry processing.  The Facility stores and uses one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, above the regulatory threshold.  Ammonia is used in the refrigeration process to chill and store poultry products prior to their delivery to retail outlets. \n\nGold Kist used RMP Comp, version 1.07, and formulas provided by the EPA in the document, RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration in the development of the worst-case and alternate release scenarios.  The chosen scenarios are detailed below.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for the ammonia refrigeration (Program 3) toxic release involves the release of the entire contents of the largest ammonia storage vessel (gaseous form) within the parameters defined by the EPA.\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves the release of ammonia in a gaseous form from a 1- inch hole in a high pressure line.  It is further defined by the parameters as outlined by the EPA in their guidance in RMP Comp 1.07 Gold Kist has taken all necessary steps to comply with the EPA's Risk Management Plan requirements as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.  The Facility is also subjuct to the reporting requirements of EPRA Setion 302.  The information below defines the accidental r"

Several methodologies have been used for the PHAs including the What-If-Checklist and the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis.  The PHA teams include qualified personnel in engineering, process operation and maintenance with a Team Leader knowledgeable in the chosen methodology.  PHA have been conducted in a timely manner as required by the regulation.  All findings and recommendations from the PHA are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures -  To safely conduct activities concerning the covered processes, Gold Kist maintains detailed operating procedures.  The procedures address operations such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown, normal shutdown and startup after a planned shut down.  The information is reviewed on at least an annual basis and operators are continually being trained on the procedures and how to access that data.\n\nTraining -  Gold Kist has a comprehensive training program to ensure that operators of the processes are competent in the procedures associated with the processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed or changes are made.\n\nMechanical Integrity -  Gold Kist performs documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe operations.  Process equipment included in this program are pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps and motors.  Maintenance operations are conducted by personnel with i"

Routine maintenance inspections deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change -  Gold Kist has written procedures to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and others who job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are made aware of the change and trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews -  New processes or modification in existing processes are subject to pre-startup safety reviews at Gold Kist as a routine practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equpment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for the safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits -  Gold Kist conducts self-directed compliance audits on a regular basis to determine if the RMP and PSM regulations are being properly implemented.  These audits are conducted at least every three years and required corrective actions from the audits are completed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation -  Gold Kist investigates incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in catastrophic releases of regulated chemicals.  These investigations identify situations leading to an incident or near-miss.  Corrective actions are addressed in a timely manner.  All reports are maintained as required by regulation.\n\nEmployee Participation -  Gold Kist believes that process safety management and accidental release prevention is a team effort.  Employees are encouraged to express views relating to accidental release prevention and safety issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nContractors -  Gold Kist hires Independent contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  As part of the contractor selection process, an evaluation of the safely performance of the contractor is conducted.  Gol"

      "SummaryText": "d Kist policy requires that contractors be infomed of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the covered processes.  Contractors are advised of all emergency response procedures should a regulated substance be accidentally released.\n\nGold Kist experienced a release of a regulated substance above the threshold reporting quantity in June 2000.  An equipment failure resulted in the accidental release of 11,000 lbs of ammonia gas (CAS #76640-41-7) to the atmosphere.  There were no off-site consequences, evacuations or injuries as a result of the release.  As a result of the accidental release, equipment was improved or upgraded.  There have been no further acidental releases above the threshold reporting quantity.\n\nGold Kist has a written emergency response plan compliant with 29 CFR 1910.120 to deal with the hazards associated with an accidental release of hazardous materials.  The emergency response plan is comprehensive, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notice of local response agencies and the State Warning Point as well as the National Response Center and the public, decontamination of personnel and affected areas of the Facility and post incident review.\n\nTo ensure a proper and safe response, emergency response equpment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the Plan is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any changes within the processes or Facility that would affect a safe emergency response.\n\nSeveral developments and improvements have resulted from the implementation of the accidental release prevention program.  The enhancement of the emergency response program, notification of the surrounding community and improvements to the process equipment are some of the major steps taken to improve safety at the Facility."
