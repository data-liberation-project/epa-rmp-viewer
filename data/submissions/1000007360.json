The plant was built in 1969 and is part of a larger site, the Bristol Facility originally built in 1909.  Today, the Bristol Facility includes the Croydon plant, the polymers solvent based acrylic production facility, and corporate engineering group.  The Croydon Plant shares many of the services provided at the Bristol Facility including a unified emergency response network.  Of the total site area of 800+ acres, only 250 acres are in actual usage with the balance of the area utilized as open space accommodating a variety of plant and animal species.\n\nThe Croydon Plant produces over 100 different products which are sold to other manufacturers who use them as key components in consumer products.  The Croydon Plant produces aqueous based acrylic emulsion products which are used as coatings and binders.  Emulsion coating products are used in interior and exterior latex paint and traffic line formulatio"

The facility\u00c2\u00bfs production units employ 129 personnel.  The plant works with the Bristol Facility contributing to a variety of charitable organizations within the community.   The Bristol Facility works closely with its Community Advisory Council (CAC) to identify the needs and community concerns.\n\n3.0\tThe EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, and updated in 2004, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under the Clean Air Act containing a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical are subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate \u00c2\u00bfworst case\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfalternate case\u00c2\u00bf scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  . \n\n4.0\tRegulated Substances\n\nThe Croydon Plant uses three RMP toxic chemicals: \n\u00c2\u00bf\tAcrylonitrile monomer\n\u00c2\u00bf\tVinyl Acetate monomer\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAqueous ammonia. \n\n\n5.0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy       \n\nRohm and Haas Croydon Plant has a long standing commitment to provide a safe workplace and to prevent accidental releases.
