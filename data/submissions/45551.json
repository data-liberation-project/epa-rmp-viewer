      "SummaryText": "Platte Chemical Company is a toll manufacturer of liquid and dry formulations of crop protection chemicals.  The company is part of United Agri Products.  The Greenville, MS facility formulates and packages emulsifiable concentrates, dry flowables, liquid suspension concentrates, pellets, and wettable powders.  These formulations include insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides.     \n\nWith the addition of the new formulation and packaging plant for liquid herbicides in 2000, the Platte Chemical Company became subject to the Risk Management Planning requirements due to the quantity of isopropylamine stored on site.\n\nThe Platte Chemical Company has a documented emergency response plan which includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of events including fire, release, and inclement weather.  The plan describes actions which result in safe response for company employees as well as notification of the surrounding community.  A copy of the plan has been given to the Washington County LEPC and the Greenville Fire Department.\n\nDuring the past 5 years there have been no RMP-defined accidental at the Greenville location.  The RMP includes one flammable worst case scenario and one flammable alternative.  The worst case scenario is catastrophic failure of a full tank resulting in fire.  Since this highly unlikely due to the design of the tank.  A more likely event is the rupture of a line containing isopropylamine.  In this alternative, area sensors would automatically shut down all valves and pumps.\n\nThe Platte Chemical Company employs all of the techniques for a comprehensive prevention and response program including process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity, operating procedures, management of change, contractor and visitor programs, and  employee training and participation programs.  \n\nIf you have questions regarding this RMP, please contact us at 662-335-3395."
