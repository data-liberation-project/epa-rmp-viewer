      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND DATA ELEMENTS\r\nThe following subsections outline the Executive Summary requirements of the EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.155.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nThe Americold Samuels facility abides by the emergency action procedures and policies\r\ndetailed in the Emergency action Plan manual. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\nAmericold Logistics maintains a (safety) committee whose members are the\r\ndesignated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the action organization and\r\nnotification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be\r\nimplemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is\r\nreviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance\r\nwith the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Americold Samuels facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold\r\nstorage warehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia\r\nthrough various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure\r\nvapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in\r\npressure are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers\r\nits temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat from a\r\nroom or product. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to\r\nvaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.

The facility has personnel that are trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \r\nDuring the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.  In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nAs part of the review of the Process Safety Management program at this facility and the update of the Process Hazard Analysis study generated mitigation meas"
