Feed rate depends on ambient weather conditions and the quantity of water processed. Chlorine gas is mixed with water from the distribution system as the gas passes into the water stream at the water ejector. \r\nThe water system is monitored continuously by a Hach Cl17 chlorine analyzer to assure that the proper amount of chlorine is present to effectively disinfect the water supply per Tennessee Division of Water Supply regulations. Depending on the results of the monitoring, the chlorine feed rate is manually adjusted to maintain sufficient chlorine for disinfection.\r\nThe City of Pulaski Water Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Program in an attempt to identify all possible chemical emergencies which may occur and the best way to prevent the accidental release of chlorine to the atmosphere from the plant's chlorination facility. The City personnel responsible for the daily maintenance and operation of the chlorination equipment conduct their work with the upmost professionalism and have a deep respect of the dangers involved with Chlorine. The City places chlorine safety ahead of all other matters. \r\nThe City's Process Safety Management (PSM) plan has been coordinated with the employees of the water treatment plant along with Chemical Feed Systems (experts in the field and the company who installed the system). Additionally, the Giles County Local Emergency Planning Committee, Pulaski Police Department, and Pulaski Fire Department have been trained to use this plan to assure that all entities are aware of the possible dangers involved in a chlorine leak from the water treatment plant. The City has developed a written operations manual, emergency response plan, and emergency action plan as part of the OSHA PSM plan. A"

The water plant currently treats an average of 3.5 MGD and uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant in the treatment process. The City uses approximately 180 pounds per day of chlorine in their pre-chlorination and post-chlorination facilities. The water treatment plant utilizes ton chlorine cylinders (usually 4 cylinders total) to provide the supply of chlorine. Typically no more than 10,000 lbs of chlorine are on the site at any time.\r\nThree gaseous chlorinators are installed in a separate room adjacent to the chlorine cylinder storage area. The chlorinators meter and inject gaseous chlorine into the raw water supply as it enters the Water Treatment Facility flash mix, additionally chlorine is injected post filter into the clearwell #1. The chlorination room is equipped with an exhaust vent fan and chlorine leak detection system. The leak detector is equipped with alarm capabilities that alarm whenever a leak is detected. Chlorine gas is supplied from the in-service chlorine cylinder at approximately 75 psig to a vacuum regulator mounted to the chlorine supply manifold. An automated switch-over valve is installed on each container to allow each container to be connected to the in-use chlorinator at the same time. As one of the containers approaches depletion, a sensor detects the high-vacuum condition causing the valve to switch to the standby container. The vacuum regulator reduces the pressure from the cylinders by using a water ejector to create a vacuum within the system. The regulator is designed to fail \"closed\" any time a loss of\r\nvacuum is experienced within any component of the system. The regulator is also designed to relieve the pressure from the system.\r\nGaseous chlorine is drawn through a flow rate indicator controller (V10K Wallace and Tier"

Additionally, safety measures are installed in the form of ventilators and chlorine leak detectors which assist in the notification and protection of emergency personnel in the event of a leak.\r\nThe emergency response plan outlines the proper procedures to follow in the event of chlorine leak detection. Upon detection of a leak, the operator on duty will notify the emergency service coordinator as defined in the City of Pulaski's Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate assistance with outside emergency units. The cause of the leak will then be determined so that appropriate actions may be taken to ensure public safety. The City of Pulaski Police and Fire Department will act as standby rescue personnel for the Giles County Emergency Management personnel while an attempt to stop the chlorine leak is made. The Police and Fire department personnel will also be familiarized with the chlorine system so as to assure that, if necessary, they may be able to isolate the leak and stop it. The emergency service coordinator will work with the Pulaski Police Department and other personnel to alert nearby residents to remove to safety if the need arises. Local radio stations, and reverse 911 may also be utilized to notify the public of the emergency condition and what to do."
