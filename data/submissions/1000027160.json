      "SummaryText": "ABE South Dakota, LLC is a fuel ethanol plant operating in Aberdeen, SD.  This facility is able to process approximately 18 million bushels of grain per year and produces up to 61 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year. The facility produces dry and wet distiller's grain and solubles as a saleable by-product.\n\n\n\nCorn is conveyed from an independently owned and operated elevator silo on adjacent property into a weighing and hammer mill system. The hammer mill grinds the grain into flour which is blended with hot water and enzymes to produce a mash.  The mash is pumped to the fermentation process. In the fermentation process, yeast and enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to sugars, which are then converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The resulting liquid (beer) contains ethanol. After approximately 50 hours, the beer in the fermentation tank(s) is pumped to a beer well.    \n\n\n\nIn the distillation process, the beer from the beer well is pumped to the top of the stripper column and is heated. The ethanol vaporizes and is collected in the rectifier, producing approximately 190 proof ethanol (93% ethanol and 7% water). The 190 proof ethanol is superheated and sent to molecular sieve beds where the remaining water is removed to produce 200 proof ethanol (100% ethanol). The 200 proof ethanol is condensed and pumped to outside storage tanks.\n\n\n\nThe whole stillage (beer without the ethanol) is centrifuged to produce thin stillage and a solid fraction. The thin stillage is sent to an evaporator where the water is evaporated to produce a syrup containing about 27 to 30 percent solids. The syrup is added with the solid fraction, which is referred to as wet distillers grain and solubles. ABE South Dakota, LLC will sell the wet distillers grain and solubles or transfer it to a dryer. The dryer will dry the wet distiller's grain and solubles to about 12 percent moisture, which is referred to as dried distillers grain and solubles. \n\n\n\nThe 200 proof ethanol"

      "SummaryText": " is denatured with gasoline.  Denaturing is required to render the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The gasoline used may either be unleaded gasoline or natural gasoline (sometimes referred to as well head gasoline or well head drip gas).  The facility has chosen natural gasoline, due to restrictions on specifications of impurities for fuel ethanol in some states.  Fuel ethanol can be combined with 15% gasoline to make E85 (85% ethanol) for use in Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV), or with 90% unleaded gasoline to make E10 (10% ethanol) for use in common automobiles.  Ethanol is added to gasoline as an oxygenation agent to aid in combustion and reduce pollution.  It replaces the current additive, methyl-tert-butyl-ether, which has been found to be a contaminate in ground water in many areas.\n\n\n\nThe process of making fuel ethanol at a plant this  does not subject it to the regulations of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  However, natural gasoline contains carbon chains greater than 5 carbon atoms, making pentane (a hydrocarbon molecule with 5 carbon atoms) a component.  Pentane is listed as a regulated chemical subject to the RMP, and therefore making the storage of natural gasoline for denaturing and anhydrous ammonia a RMP covered process. \n\n\n\nFor ABE South Dakota,LLC, this RMP is completed on the natural gasoline and anhydrous ammonia storage tank, associated piping, pumps and metering controls.The Denatured Ethanol storage tanks that contain up to 1,128,000 gallons are exempt from the CAA 112(r)(7)'s Risk Management Program provisions because the entire mixture does not meet the NFPA - 4 criteria.  Information found on the MSDS indicates that the Denatured Ethanol is a NFPA - 3.   ABE South Dakota, LLC follows the general duty provisions to operate the Denatured Ethanol safely under the CAA 112(r)(1) (the General Duty Clause).  \n\n\n\nABE South Dakota,LLC has an active preventive maintenance program that incorporates the inspection of the natural gasoline (denaturant"

      "SummaryText": ") and anhydrous ammonia storage tank and the associated piping and equipment.  In an effort to assure protection of the environment, the two denaturant tanks are situated in a bermed area to provide secondary containment for the denaturant tank contents in the event of an accidental uncontrolled release.  ABE South Dakota, LLC uses the local fire department to respond to emergencies, but also has an emergency action plan.  In the event of a large release of denaturant, the Plan calls for contacting a large local construction company with equipment to build additional dikes and containment, as necessary.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the physical protection of secondary containment, there is also a fusible link valve on the denaturant, denatured ethanol and ethanol storage tanks.  This valve closes in the event of a fire, preventing the tank to drain through a damaged header or ruptured pipe.  The facility also maintains a portable trailer with a fire-fighting foam eductor capable of connecting to a fire hydrant to foam flammable liquid fires.  This trailer has been made available for local fire department use in the event of a community emergency.\n\n\n\nABE South Dakota, LLC  has instituted Process Safety Management (PSM) as a program. We believe this is another tool to enhance employee safety programs, protect the environment and continue safe operation of equipment.  As a rule, very few hazardous chemicals are stored on site in a quantity to cause significant problems in a release situation.  Heartland Grain Fuels,LP actively trains employees on chemical use and handling procedures.  \n\n\n\nOnly two substances are present at this facility in sufficient quantities to be regulated under the Risk Management Planning regulations: natural gasoline (pentane) and ammonia.  The small tank of natural gasoline, sometimes called drip gas, stores a maximum capacity of 12,085 gallons and the larger tank stores a maximum capacity of 100,000 gallons of natural gasoline.  The small tank measures 1"

During the course of the year, approximately 2 million gallons are cycled through these tanks. This tank contents are used to denature ethanol to render it unfit for human consumption.  The anhydrous ammonia tank stores a maximum capacity of 90,000 pounds and measures 9 foot by 32 foot.  There are also two 4400 pound nurse tanks onsite. During the course of the year we use about 2,000,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nABE South Dakota, LLC is subject to and complies with several federal and state regulations.  These regulations govern the storage and use of hazardous chemicals, purity of waste waters, air emissions and product tracking.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates worker and chemical safety, with provisions of Worker Right-to-know.  The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-know Act has 2 annual reports requiring the tracking of chemicals stored, used and released at the facility.  Waste waters are analyzed before releasing to a surface stream and under a state permit, and discharging to a publicly owned treatment works under a city permit (by agreements with the EPA to enforce the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Act).  Surface storm water runoff content is monitored to comply with the Clean Water Act regulations, and HGFLP maintains a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.  The facility maintains and complies with a Title V air permit under the Clean Air Act Amendments (administered by the State of South Dakota).  In addition to regulations for similar production facilities, the production of ethanol is under the purview of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), which requires the facility to maintain a license and surety bond, and regulations overseen by the Department of Transportation.\n\n    \n\nThe fuel ethanol facility in Aberdeen has not experienced any major accidents, injuries, or spills"
