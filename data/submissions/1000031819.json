This Risk Management Program was initially created in November of 2007.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Dairies, Inc. Visalia prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release\n\nPrevention (CalARP) program, are codified in the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1,\n\net.

The regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally,\n\nboth the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and\n\nHealth Association (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM\n\nregulations, as defined in CCR Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\n\n\nSCOPE\n\nThe EPA RMP regulation requires that an Executive Summary be provided as part of the registration submitted\n\nto the EPA.

The RMP\n\nsections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis)\n\nReport.\n\n\n\nReporting and Action: Federal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is a  substantial accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental\n\nrelease of ammonia. California Dairies interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury\n\nabove and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\n\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms. All releases are to be\n\nmonitored and all readings recorded. All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop or correct procedures\n\nthat may prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nAny release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending on\n\nthe location of the release. The General Manager and Maintenance are to be called if not on site for support.\n\nReleases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the General Manager and Maintenance, if not on\n\nsite, for instructions.\n\n\n\nThere are additional full time supervisory and operational employees at this facility in addition to the\n\nMaintenance Supervisor that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia\n\nsystem on a regular basis during daily rounds and walks.

      "SummaryText": "D\n\nThe California Dairies facility provides production, product cooling, and short-term storage of dairy products.\n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Tulare County on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the\n\nrefrigerant in the Main Plant Refrigeration System. The total ammonia inventory in the Main Plant system\n\nexceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a combination of a direct, closed loop, and secondary coolant mechanical refrigeration system. The original process was built in 2007. The ammonia equipment is located outside, in a machinery room and in a cooler/freezer.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel\n\nor pipe. As this system has interconnected piping and since the largest vessel can hold the complete charge the total system charge was used for the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this\n\nscenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition the\n\nMain Plant System is separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will\n\ndecrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide\n\nuniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCalifornia Dairies Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM (CalARP) Manual. The RMP Prevention\n\nProgram is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program\n\nimplemented by California Dairies is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nKey objectives of California Dairies Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system techni"
