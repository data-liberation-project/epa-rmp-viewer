      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Thunderbird Processing Plant \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Partners, owner and operator of the Thunderbird Processing Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. EnLink's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Thunderbird Processing Plant for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. The Thunderbird Processing Plant inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable. \n\n\n\nThe facility is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant that is designed to process natural gas. The facility is designed for 220 MMSCFD. The plant consists of the following: inlet gas separation and filtration, dehydration, condensate stabilization, amine treatment unit, cryogenic processing unit, refrigeration system, residue compression, flash gas compression, flare system, and all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in four 750-barrel atmospheric tanks located within secondary containment areas and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. NGL from the cryogenic units and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storage. \n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary"

EnLink, Thunderbird Processing Plant, RMP Page 5 \n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nThe processes at the Thunderbird Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility. \n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features \n\nThe Thunderbird Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\n\n\nRelease Detection \n\n1. Tanks are gauged \n\n2. Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors \n\n3. High/Low alarms and shutdowns \n\n4. Facility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week \n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control \n\n1. Berms around tanks \n\n2. Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing \n\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated) \n\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature) \n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system) \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation \n\n1. Trained emergency response personnel \n\n2. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing) \n\n3. SPCC Plan \n\n4. Fire extinguishers \n\nEnLink, Thunderbird Processing Plant, RMP Page 6 \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information \n\nThe Thunderbird Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a f"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Thunderbird Processing Plant is coordinated with the Blaine County LEPC. The Blaine County Sheriff Office can be reached at 208-788-5555 for non-emergencies or by calling 911 in the case of an emergency. The Thunderbird Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability. EnLink Midstream Partners operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Blaine County Sheriff Office). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. EnLink Midstream Partners conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Thunderbird Processing Plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regul"

Therefore, the facility has no accident history. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe Thunderbird Processing Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. \n\nRecord Keeping \n\nThe owner or operator of the Thunderbird Processing Plant should maintain this documentation supporting the implementation of the RMP for five years (40 CFR part 68.200).\n\n"
