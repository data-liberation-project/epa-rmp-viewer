The DuPont Nevada site adheres to Corporate Safety Health and Environmental (SHE) policies which are a part of that program. For safety and environmental incidents, these policies can be summarized as follows;\n\n-We believe all safety and environmental incidents are preventable.\n\n-Our goal for incidents is zero.\n\n-We are prepared for emergencies and we will provide leadership for our local communities to help in their emergency preparedness. \n\n\n\nCorporate Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) & RCMS policies are embodied in numerous site SHE procedures along with guidelines and recommended practices in DuPont Engineering Standards. Corporate SHE policies and Nevada site SHE procedures are available for review by all employees. Various site procedures specifically address Process Safety Management elements to prevent incidents from occurring. It is the responsibility of every employee and contractor\n\nworking on our behalf to comply with these procedures. It is management's responsibility to educate and train employees so they may understand and comply with the procedures.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe DuPont Nevada site consists of approximately 65 acres located approximately two miles west of Nevada, IA. The site is focused strictly on producing non-potable ethanol from cellulosic feed stocks. The site uses the following EPA regulated RMP chemicals at levels above their process threshold quantities:\n\nToxics - anhydrous ammonia              Flammables - none\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Nevada site manufacturing areas follow the requirements set out in DuPont Corporate SHE Standard S21A, Process Safety Management. This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 6"

Nevada plant personnel are trained and equipped to respond to accidental chemical releases. The program can be summarized as follows:\n\nTraining and preparation\n\n-Plant personnel and emergency responders receive emergency response training.\n\n-Emergency response plans are periodically reviewed and updated.\n\n-The plant conducts periodic emergency drills, including critiques.\n\n-A plant representative actively participates on the Story County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n-If a release with the potential for off-site impact occurs:\n\n-The plant emergency alarm is sounded.\n\n-The plant Emergency Control Organization (ECO) Headquarters is activated.\n\n-Plant emergency personnel respond.\n\n-Community responders are notified and asked to respond as appropriate.\n\n\n\nPrograms detailing emergency responder training and emergency equipment maintenance can be found in the Nevada site emergency response manual (PSM12), the site computer maintenance management system (SAP), and hard-copy based training records. All of these activities are monitored to ensure they remain current.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nMaking our processes safer is an on-going program at the Nevada site. Employee suggestions, capital improvements, audit programs, and various other activities help to ensure that we provide safe, reliable processes. Other programs aimed at improving process safety and our emergency response planning include:\n\n- Recommendations developed during cyclic process hazards analyses that reduce the risks associated with our processes.\n\n- Providing additional process safety training to technical personnel in topics such as chemical reactivity, layer of protection analysis, and safety instrumented systems risk analysis.\n\n- Expanding periodic process safety metrics reporting to management."
