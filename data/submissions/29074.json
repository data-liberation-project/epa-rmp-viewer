The same properties that makes chlorine valuable as a retail/wholesale chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safety storage devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\nOur emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of trained HazMat Personnel from Chemtrec to respond to a release of chlorine.  The notification of this facility has two persons who are trained to respond (Curtis Thomas and Jim Gruber).  Personnel at Dallas Tailor & Laundry Supply will then notify 911 for notification to other agencies. The 911 System will also notify Dallas County Offices of Emergency Services.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to receive and distribute pre-packaged chlorine to customers. Chlorine is received in individual 150 pound cylinders at the 502 Second Avenue location and stored until sold and distributed. Chlorine is removed from delivery trucks by the utilization of no less than 2 employees and a two wheel dolly.  The chlorine is stored in the warehouse area in a designated area.  This area is a cool, well ventilated concrete floored area to help keep the cylinders cool and dry.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized fac"

The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this plant is 25,000 pounds. There is no chlorine used in a process, only storage.\n\n\n \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 150 pounds of chlorine from the 502 Second Avenue location. Passive mitigation has been considered for this scenario.  The chlorine cylinders are located in the warehouse which is constructed of concrete floor, and metal sided walls on all sides.  The receiving dock and bay door is open to the air when the door is open.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 0.2 miles.  This location is classified as urban due to the thickly populated area and flat terrain around the site.\n\nAn alternative scenario was determined for this facility; however, based on the type of prevention system in place and the no-use of chlorine, the alternative release from a 150 pound cylinder should be minimal for the 502 Second Avenue site.  Since the chlorine is not actually used in a process, rather it is only stored, there should not be a release from a chlorine cylinder.  All cylinders are repackaged and inspected by the supplier prior to arrival at the 502 Second Avenue site.  An alternate release could result from an improperly sealed packing nut at the valve.  An estimation of the release would be approximately 5 pounds released into the atmosphere.  This amount of vapor chlorine release would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.08 miles.  \n\nThis chemical and allied product wholesale facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five"
