The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances used on site. The AUC facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community. AUC's emergency response program has incorporated EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the One Plan.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nAUC repackages chlorine and sulfur dioxide into U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks (commonly known as ton containers). In addition, AUC manufactures 10.5% and 12.5% by weight sodium hypochlorite as well as 25% and 38% sodium bisulfite. The facility includes a private rail sidetrack for unloading railcars. A production building, with an emergency scrubber, is used for packaging the cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks. The sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite manufacturing and quality control testing are performed in\nthe production building as well, with sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite production tanks, also connected to the scrubber, just outside of the production building in a dedicated aboveground storage tank containment. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detection system as well as CCTV camera system continuously monitors all production and storage locations, and Georgia Port Security randomly patrols the road outside of the facility. The emergency shutdown system may be activated manually by an employee or automatically by the gas detection system. Based upon the program criteri"
