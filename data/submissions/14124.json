There are four inset clearwells as well as two off site elevated storage tanks.  The chemical feed system consists of two chemical feed pumps that inject Bayfloc 9100 as a coagulant and caustic soda as a coagulant aid to the rapid mix.  There is an injection feed system for chlorine dioxide that goes into the influent line to the rapid mix followed by liquid ammonium sulfate.  There is also a chlorination feed system injects chlorine at a rapid mix carrying a chloramine residual all the way to the distribution system.  This system"

      "SummaryText": "is capable of treating potable water at a rate of 8.352 million gallons per day.  This plant serves approximately 24,000 people.  Approximately 12,000 pounds of chlorine are kept at the plant site in 6 one (1) ton cylinders.  Approximately 4.0 MGD of water is treated daily.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\nBoth of these scenarios are included as part of the RMP*Submit Program.  The ALOHA Model was used for the 1-ton worst case scenario.  The RMP-Method Model was used for the alternative release of chlorine gas.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) annually inspects this facility to insure that chlorination equipment and processes meet state requirements.  Entity will conduct a Safety Unit Inspection and an Compliance Audit on or before December 15, 1999 to insure that equipment and process conform to state/EPA requirements.  The Safety and Audit inspections will be included as part of the O & M Water Treatment Plant Manual.  The City will continue to train personnel to insure that accidental releases of chlorine gas are minimized or do not occur.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nFor the last 5 years, there have been no accidents due to the release of chlorine gas from this facility.  There have been no accidental releases from this facility that have caused property damage or injury to the public.  The City will continue to train plant personnel to prevent any releases of chlorine gas.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Emergency Response Program for this facility is referenced in the City of San Benito's Emergency Management Office Manual as previously noted.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nAt the present time, five (5) permanent operators are employed at the plant.  All five operators are certified (1-A, 1-B, and 3-C).  All certified operators are required to attend Texas A & M Training Classes to maintain their ce"
