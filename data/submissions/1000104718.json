The Five-year Accident History:  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that to our knowledge have: \n\na) Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or \nb) Resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and an emergency response plan in accordance with 40 CFR 68.95, which includes a specific information on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release. Emergency response training is also provided throughout the year at various training sessions, including but not limited to a training session just on anhydrous ammonia held every fall.  \n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nd. A Safety Data Sheet for anhydrous ammonia for quick access and reference.\n\ne. A Minnesota AWAIR (A Workplace Accident and Injury Reduction) program in place and is committed to a safe work environment as well as protection of the community in which we operate.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  \n\nSafety is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to ensure safe operating conditions. CFS plans to continue education and training for employees along with periodic inspections by the local fire department."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service, Bricelyn, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and all other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia would be approximately 282,000 pounds in our two 12,000 and one 18,000 gallon storage tanks; and approximately 70,600 pounds available capacity in various 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\nThe site is seasonal.  Approximately 2-3 may work at the site, but on a part-time basis only during the early spring and late fall of each year. However, the site would have daily visual inspections during the off season.  \n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections."
