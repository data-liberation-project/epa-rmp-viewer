      "SummaryText": "\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nTitle III of the U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA), Amendments of 1990, requires that certain facilities prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Greenleaf 2 Power Plant, located in Sutter County, California, is subject to that requirement. The State of California has responded to the federal requirements with development of its own regulations in CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  The regulations set forth a program known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program or CalARP.\n\n\n\nThe CalARP requirements closely parallel the federal requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. This RMP has been developed according to the CalARP regulations. Many of the requirements under CalARP are the same as those mandated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which is already in effect at Greenleaf 2.\n\n\n\nRelease and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe chemical process at Greenleaf 2 covered under the CalARP program is the use of anhydrous ammonia for the reduction of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust from the power plant. Greenleaf 2's policy is to prevent unplanned or accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in any quantity. Previously developed environmental and injury and illness prevention policies reinforce this release policy and, when implemented act to prevent releases. The environmental and injury and illness prevention policies are contained in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nGreenleaf 2's policy prohibits employees to responding to emergencies such as catastrophic releases of anhydrous ammonia. However, employees are allowed to respond to small or incidental releases such as minor leaks or spills.\n\n\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nGreenleaf 2 is a nominal 49.2-megawatt cogeneration facility, which uses a Stewart and Stevenson package containing a General Electric LM5000 gas turbine and a Brush generator to produce electrical power.

Greenleaf 2 employs 14 persons to run and maintain the power plant. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used to control the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the power plant's exhaust stack to meet the facility's permitted air emissions limits. Ammonia vapor is injected into the stack's Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system, supplied by Johnson-Matthey Company. Anhydrous ammonia suppliers deliver ammonia in tank trucks to refill the Greenleaf 2 storage tank. The ammonia is delivered as a liquid under pressure. The 12,000-gallon storage tank is filled to a maximum level of 9,600 gallons approximately two times per year. Ammonia vapor is drawn from the tank, diluted with ambient air, and injected into the SCR system via an injection grid. An automatic control and monitoring system regulates the vapor flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire ammonia storage, vaporization, and injection cycle is relatively simple and designed and operated per standard industry practice. The plant has an emergency response plan for appropriately responding to any ammonia vapor release.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case anhydrous ammonia release scenario assumed 9,600 gallons of ammonia were released from the storage tank at the rate of 6,000 lb/min, so that all of the contents escaped from the tank in 10 minutes. Meteorological conditions at the time of the release were assumed to include a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec, an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C, an atmospheric stability class F, and an urban topography. The results of the analysis using U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp simulation model were a distance (radius) of 2.8 miles to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 mg/l, or approximately 200 ppm. Approximately 47,553 people would be included within the 2.8-mile radius.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed that a leak in the delivery hose from the truck to the storage tank would release 3 gallons in one minute.

      "SummaryText": "al conditions at the time of the release were assumed to include a wind speed of 3 meters/second, an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C, an atmospheric stability class D, and an urban topography. The results of the analysis using U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp simulation model were a distance (radius) of less than 0.1 mile to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 mg/l, or approximately 200 ppm. Further analysis estimated that the toxic endpoint concentration radius was approximately 0.01 mile, or 53 feet. People potentially affected by the release would include only Greenleaf 2 employees.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Greenleaf 2 release prevention program addresses a number of areas to prevent releases of ammonia. These areas include a process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permits, and procedures for the procurement and use of contractors.\n\n\n\nA key item of the RMP prevention program is the PHA. This analysis was performed for the anhydrous ammonia system by a team of knowledgeable persons. The team used a \"what-if\" approach, which determined what events could possibly cause an accidental release of ammonia. The team then assigned a probability to the occurrence of each event. The team identified several actions that should be considered by Greenleaf 2 to reduce the probability of an accidental release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nSince the start-up of the facility in 1989, there have been no accidents or catastrophic releases involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nGreenleaf 2 has an emergency response plan in place. This plan incorporates all CalARP requirements for an RMP emergency response program. Key elements of the program are procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies in the event of a release, steps to be taken for medical fir"

Recommendations now being implemented include the addition of chains between traffic guards surrounding the ammonia storage tank, the placement of traffic cones around the ammonia delivery truck while unloading ammonia, and the use of personal protective equipment for employees involved in opening and closing valves.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Greenleaf 2 management will verify unloading procedures with ammonia vendors and confirm that vendor procedures ensure that chemicals other than ammonia are not inadvertently delivered to the Greenleaf 2 storage tank.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nGreenleaf 2 has complied with the RMP requirements and is committed to reviewing and enhancing the plant's emergency preparedness program periodically as appropriate and in compliance with the federal and state requirements.\n\n\n\nThe RMP program documents are complete and accessible to all interested persons at all times. The Greenleaf 2 RMP program is proactive, meets the CalARP requirements, and confirms Greenleaf 2's commitment to its environmental and safety policies, which are designed to protect the offsite public and environment, employees, and contractors.\n\n\n\nThe RMP was prepared by Greenleaf 2 with assistance from CH2M HILL.\n\n\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________            ______________________\n\nSignature                        Print "
