This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area.  Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere.  Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance.  Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment.  Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\n\n\nPlant leaders serve as coaches, encouragers, and examples.  Yet, in light of our culture, every person is considered a Safety Leader at home and work.  Constant discussion, planning, and training on safety issues will serve to maintain safety awareness and to insure that a high priority is always placed on safety.  No job is ever so urgent that safety is jeopardized.  Procedures are followed and time is taken to plan the best course of action with the least potential for mishap.  As situations and work requirements change, individual safety awareness must grow to accommodate and address these changes. Likewise, environmental performance will not be compromised to other priorities.  Our people will be leaders in doing the right thing. team planning, awareness, knowledge, and sharing will be our primary tools for responsible process operations and accurate reporting.\n\n\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be so comfortable with our records and procedures that we become passive.  Our goal and attitude will be sustained improvement in keeping safety and environment as priorities.  Our people are very capable of working safely, alert to preventing unsafe or environmentally risky situations, and intend to get better as time goes by. \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: \n\n\n\nThe facility is located on a 17 acre site, with paved shipping and re"

The major structures and their designated functions are: Warehouse w/ docks; Receiving Area w/ docks; Machinery Spaces; Bottling Room & Production Areas; and Coolers.  The facility produces pasteurized milk products for its distributors. The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance: and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers and other storage vessels, purgers, and a variety of heat exchanges (evaporators, air handlers, etc.). \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: \n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance.  The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\n\n\n  OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program. \n\n  Ammonia detection and alarm system throughout the ammonia system.\n\n  Eyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\n\n  Personal protective equipment, including emergency respirators.\n\n  Emergency communication systems.\n\n  Training Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\n\n  Plant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\n\n  Plant Safety Recognition System.\n\n  Monthly Safety Meetings.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\n\n\nThere hav"

The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies.  The plan includes \"Emergency Response to Anhydrous Ammonia,\" specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: \n\n\n\nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
