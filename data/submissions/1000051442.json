      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe City of Orlando owns and operates the Water Conserv II Water Reclamation Facility (WCII), located at 5420 L.B. McLeod Road, Orlando, Florida. WCII uses one regulated toxic substance, chlorine, in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities for these substances in the RMP rule. The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions as a safeguard to our workers, our community, and the environment. Chlorine is notably irritating to the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. More serious human health effects could result from much higher exposure, such as intense coughing, chest pains, and in extreme cases, death.\n\n\n\nThe City of Orlando's commitment at WCII is to store, handle and use chemicals in a manner that achieves the needed benefits while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks. This is accomplished by designing safe processes, maintaining the processes in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and providing an emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a chlorine release, should a process accident ever occur. Our commitment to employee and community protection is demonstrated in the fact that over WCII's entire operating history, there have been no chemical accidents that resulted in death, serious employee injury or offsite consequences. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is the City's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations. This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for accidental release prevention and emergency response. \n\n\n\nThe primary measures for accidental chemical release prevention are contained in the document Process Safety Management/Risk Management Programs for WCII.

WCII's Plant Manager has the responsibility for ensuring that these prevention programs are implemented in the workplace as written.\n\n\n\nThe WCII emergency response plan relies on a team of onsite trained personnel and, as necessary, offsite mutual-aid groups such as fire and rescue services. The emergency response plans are based on the Incident Command system, where onsite responders work in coordination with local hazardous materials response teams to implement the WCII and regional response plans. WCII's personnel receive annual chlorine emergency response training, which includes the donning of protective equipment and hands-on application of the chlorine cylinder repair kits kept at the plant.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled Chlorine is received at the facility by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications. Upon arrival at the site, all chemical cylinders are thoroughly inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptly refused. Once accepted, the cylinders are stored inside a covered storage area equipped with detectors that immediately notify the operators of a release should a leak occur. A scrubber is in place for treatment of a release before it leaves the building. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps Conserv II's risk prevention documents contain up to 13 essential release prevention elements. Some of the key accidental release prevention elements of the PSM program are as follows: \n\n\n\n* Process hazard analysis: This analysis was performed for each step in the chlorine processes, to identify potential process failure scenarios and the appropriate prevention or response meas"

The process hazard analysis will be updated every 5 years.\n\n\n\n* Operating procedures review: The review was conducted to ensure that operators are given clear, written instructions for safely operating the processes.\n\n\n\n* Training programs: Training is given to each employee assigned to the process with continuing operator training thereafter, with an emphasis on safe chlorine handling and emergency response. The City has been on the forefront among utilities in chemical safety training.\n\n\n\n* Contractors: The City ensures through its contract provisions that contractors supplying or working with processes are held to a standard of safety performance that complies with the City's safety goals and objectives, and also meets relevant agency requirements. City personnel make visits to the supplier's site to ensure that rules and guidelines concerning cylinder integrity are being followed.\n\n\n\n* Mechanical integrity: The integrity and reliability of the process is maintained by implementing preventive maintenance and routine inspection and testing procedures.\n\n\n\n* Management of Change: The management of change procedures provides a systematic approach to evaluate and control the safety and health aspects of any significant change to the process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures.\n\n\n\n* Incident Investigation: The City investigates within 48 hours any accidents or \"near misses\" that could have resulted in a chemical release, in order to develop measures to prevent a recurrence. The above elements are only part of the City's aggressive safety program. In addition to the 13 PSM elements, WCII has established related OSHA safety programs such as hot work and confined space. These OSHA safety programs apply to both the City and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents in"

The emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for employee accounting, notification procedures, medical duties, and response procedures for spills or leaks. If a major chemical leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response teams for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: The City is committed to continuously improving the safety of its operations for the benefit of its personnel, the surrounding community and the environment. Implementation of the process safety management procedures, periodic audits and process hazard analyses, and employee training are some of the means to achieve this continuous improvement.\n\n"
