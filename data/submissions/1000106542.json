This facility is adjacent to a second Buckeye operated RMP covered facility, but is operationally distinct. To distinguish the two facilities, the Facility that this RMP pertains to is identified as \"East Chicago, Propylene\"\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - East Chicago Complex complies to the extent feasible with the American Petroleum Institute Standard 2510 for the Design and Construction of LPG Installation, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the East Chicago Fire Department as well as the Lake County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification to the local Emergency Management Services and Saint Catherine's Hospital. This facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency. Additional hazmat capabilities are provided by the East Chicago Fire Department and contracted services.\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - East Chicago Complex complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The facility maintains a trained incipient fire response and hazardous materials response team. The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Lake County LEPC. The East Chicago Fire Department was invited to participate in an initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.  The facility maintains a vegetation control plan to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of storage vessels.\n\nBuckeye Terminals, LLC continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety.  Also, Buckeye is considering a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all three year PSM/RMP training cycles."
