Tetra a privately owned micronutrient manufacturing facility in Fairbury, Nebraska.  Tetra maintains all of the equipment in its process by employing the best engineering practices in the industry.  Tetra strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of Tetra's policies and by developing and maintaining this Risk Management Program Tetra is complying with the Federal Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it.  Tetra is committed to the accidental release prevention program.  \n\n\n\nTetra maintains a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for the Ammoniated Zinc Process.  The plan will be reviewed with response organizations and others.  \n\n\n\n50 CFR 68.155(b)    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Tetra'a Ammoniated Zinc Process produced ammoniated zinc by feeding water, zinc chloride, citric acid, and anhydrous ammonia into a low-pressure reactor.  Alternating additions of zinc chloride, citric acid, water, and anhydrous ammonia continue until the batch is complete.  The primary function of the anhydrous ammonia is to raise the pH of the water/zinc chloride solution.\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in a pressure vessel under ambient temperature.  The pressure vessel has a 30,000 gallon or 150,000 pound capacity with a maximum fill level at 85%.  As the result, the normal operating amount of ammonia stored in the Tetra Micronutrient is 25,000 gallons or 125,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(c)    "

      "SummaryText": "The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\n\n\n\nUnder the Risk Management Program, an offisite consequence analysis is required for an accidental release of a regulated substance.  In Tetra's case, anhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance.  Modeling of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia are required for offsite consequence analysis under Program 2.\n\n\n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The largest quantity is determined by taking into account administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored or processed in a vessel at any one time, or alternatively, procedures that occasionally allow the vessel to store greater than usual quantities.   EPA defined alternative release scenarios to be any release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite.\n\n\n\nFor offsite consequence analysis, the movement and dispersion of a regulated substance release to the atmosphere is predicted using the computer model called Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmosphere (ALOHA).  ALOHA predicts pollutant concentration downwind from the source, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of ammonia, the physical characteristics of the site, weather condition, and the circumstance of the release.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario selected for the Tetra's Ammoniated Zinc Process is the loss of 125,000 pounds of pressurized anhydrous ammonia representing a complete failure of the pressure vessel.  The entire content of the pressure vessel is released to the atmosphere within 10 minutes resulting in a release rate of 12,500 lbs/min.  Modeling results show that the worst-case scenario w"

The toxic endpoint is defined as the point where the ammonia concentration is below the level of concern, which is 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the Tetra's Ammoniated Zinc Process is the release of 125,000 pounds of pressurized anhydrous ammonia resulting from a failed connection on the pressure vessel.  The entire content of the pressure vessel is released to the atmosphere in 60 minutes resulting in a release rate of 2,083 lbs/min.  Modeling results show that the alternative release scenario would have an offsite toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles where the ammonia concentration drops below the level of concern of 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm.\n\n    \n\n40 CFR 68.155(d)    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nTetra Micronutrient has a Release Prevention Program in place to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at this facility.  The Release Prevention Program includes:\n\n\n\n* Safety Information (SI)\n\nTetra will develop and keep current, working copies of SI documentation including information pertaining to hazards of the process, the technology of the process and the equipment of the process.  This information will be used to inform employees and contractors.\n\n\n\n* Hazard Review (HR)\n\nTetra is committed to performing HR to identify, evaluate and control hazards associated with the Ammoniated Zinc Process and to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.50.\n\n\n\n* Operating Procedures (OPs)\n\nTetra has developed OPs for the Ammoniated Zinc Process and will updated the Ops as required.\n\n\n\n* Training\n\nTetra is committed to providing its employees with comprehensive training to assure that the work force can perform their duties safely, efficiently and effectively.\n\n\n\n* Maintenance\n\nTetra utilized a preventive maintenance scheduling software to track daily maintenance need.
