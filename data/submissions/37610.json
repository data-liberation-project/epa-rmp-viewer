GKN policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in order to 1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, 2) reduce the threat to employees? health, and 3) reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.\n\nSafety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of the operation, the safe handling procedures used, the training of personnel, and the manner in which an accidental release is handled.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nGKN Sinter Metals utilizes anhydrous ammonia at the facility for heat treating as part of the sintering process.  The anhydrous ammonia is dissociated through the use of heat and a catalytic reaction, forming nitrogen and hydrogen gases.  The hydrogen is utilized as a heat source at the furnace, and the nitrogen is used as a blanketing mechanism at the furnace as a barrier to unwanted contaminants.  Anhydrous ammonia is received in a 12,000 gallon tank and a 15,000 gallon tank.  The tanks are not filled to greater than 82% capacity.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nGKN complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard as well as all applicable state codes and regulations.  Properly trained GKN employees conduct daily and weekly inspections and maintenance activities on the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nGKN implements an emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  Employees receive training on an annual basis.  The facilit"

The Washington County LEPC has developed an Offsite Plan to address a release of ammonia at the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SECURITY\n\nGKN believes that safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Improvements to the program will be made as necessary or as the opportunity arises.  GKN became ISO 14000 certified in 2002 and plans to voluntarily certify to ISO 18000 in 2005."
