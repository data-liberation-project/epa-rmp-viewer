              "Description": "The primary activity at this facility is the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia into nurse trailers for our farmer customers. Because we are located in the midst of a small community and are within close proximity of a state highway, accident prevention is of the utmost importance.                                                                                Employee training and preventative maintenance are the two key aspects of our accident prevention program. This is enhanced by our contractual agreement with Regulatory Consultants Inc. RCI provides us with regulatory information and safety training usually achieved only by much larger companies.                                              Anhydrous ammonia is transferred only by employees that have undergone our ongoing training and safety instruction. Our primary employee involved with NH3 transfer (and also our accident prevention program administrator) has over 20 years of experience handling anhydrous ammonia.                                                                    Anhydrous ammonia equipment is maintained under published guidelines. Hoses and relief valves are replaced within dated periods. RCI also provides an annual inspection to backup our own periodic inspections.",

The primary activity at this facility is the storage and loading of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers for direct application. The maximum quantity stored would be 56,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.                             The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.6 miles.                                                The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:                                 - have caused any injuries, deaths, or property damage; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shel"
