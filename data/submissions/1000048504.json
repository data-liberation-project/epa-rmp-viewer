As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Dresick Cooling has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\r\n \r\n1.1 Dresick Cooling, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Dresick Cooling has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name         |     Process Chemical     |     Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration      Anhydrous Ammonia          40,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\r\n\r\n1.2 Process Description\r\n\r\nDresick Cooling is a commercial packinghouse and cold storage for lettuce, cherries, melons, and citrus products.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to five (5) cold storage rooms, one (1) cherry hydrocooler, and up-to four (4) vacuum coolers. The ammonia system has two (2) high pressure receivers, four (4) BAC evaporative condensers, (1) plate and frame heat recovery unit, one (1) main suction accumulator, one (1) liquid transfer vessel, one (1) thermosyphon vessel, and six (6) screw compressors. A PLC has substantial control of the system.\r\n\r\nThe system operates as follows:  High pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms. Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to a main suction accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into liquid transfer vessels. Operation of a float switch activated"

Lastly, emergency dump boxes contain switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at Dresick Cooling consists of equipment, vessels, valves and piping which are interconnected.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nDresick Cooling has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process.
