A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained an Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \r\n1.2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 900 E. Blanco Road in Salinas, California.  The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\r\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 53,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Two (2) transportable (skid mounted) ammonia refrigeration systems are often located on the site, but are not interconnected to the fixed system and are not considered part of the A\u00bfprocessA\u00bf for this RMP.\r\n1.3.\tRelease Scenarios\r\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the dual High Pressure Receivers (a maximum of (32,000 lbs) .  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.1 miles.\r\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia from a ruptured liquid line caused by thermal expansion due to doubl"

This event did not meet the criteria for a reportable accident.\r\nA\u00b7\tIn 2008 A\u00bf Ammonia release at the roof level. The investigation determined that approximately 50 lbs of ammonia vapor was released to the air from a pin-hole leak from a failed weld (due to corrosion) in Ammonia Zone 3 Evaporator 10 piping. Entire piping was replaced. Adjacent facilities were notified and the incident was reported to Monterey County Health Department.\r\nA\u00b7\tIn 2009  - On February 24 and 25, 2009 multiple reports of ammonia odors were received within specific areas of the facility. A detailed investigation eventually determined that the cause of the odors were minute cracks that had developed in the plates of a A\u00bfPlate and FrameA\u00bf chiller. These were allowing small amounts of ammonia to be dissolved in the chilled water A\u00bf eventually giving rise to the odors.

The facility receives lettuce, fruit and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad/fruit mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\r\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating product at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 32,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Two (2) transportable (skid mounted) ammonia refrigeration systems are often located on the site, but are not interconnected to the fixed system and are not considered part of the \"process\" for this RMP.\r\nRelease Scenarios\r\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the entire ammonia system charge (32,000 lbs) from the High Pressure Receivers1.  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.1 miles.\r\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia from a ruptured liquid line caused by thermal expansion due to double blocking of the line2.  The largest-volume outdoor liquid line was assumed, and the entire length of this 2-inch nominal inside diameter line between blocking valves was included (394 feet).  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario even though line lockout/tagout (an administrative control) exists.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 mile.\r\nAccide"

      "SummaryText": "ntal Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.  \r\nThis includes:\r\n* Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification;\r\n* Performance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information; \r\n* Implementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA; \r\n* Appropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel;  \r\n* Performance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot work permit programs;\r\n* Application of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols; and\r\n* Use of qualified contractors for work on the system.\r\nThe detailed Ammonia System Release Prevention Program is contained in a supporting document (current revision is Rev 0, June, 1999), which is maintained at the site's Safety and Risk Management Office.\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nBetween June 21, 1994 (five years prior to the filing of the original facility Risk Management Plan) and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  However, two ammonia-related incidents that have occurred at the facility include the following:\r\n* On May 24, 2001 a combination of equipment faults and procedural errors caused an overpressure condition on one of the portable skid mounted ammonia systems.   When the overpressure relief valve actuated, 79.8 pounds of ammonia were released ove"

The employee declined to see the physician and, after a brief rest, returned to work.\r\n* On July 9, 2001 an odor was detected, and upon investigation, a defective relief valve and loose union on the pumper drum for a low-pressure receiver was found(LPR #3, pumper drum #2).  It is estimated that less than 5 pounds of ammonia were released.  Two employees reported to the nurse, complaining of irritation (eye, nose, throat) and nausea.  No follow-up treatment was required.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nFresh Express has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies.  The plan (current document Rev 1, dated June 2004) is maintained at the site's Safety and Risk Management Office.  The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of ammonia releases. \r\nThe site has an Ammonia Emergency Response Team trained to use the Incident Command System organizational framework.  This is also described in detail in the planning document.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nBased on the studies conducted during preparation of this RMP, the following adjustments are planned to ensure continued safe operations:\r\nActions Related to the Low-Pressure Receivers (Node 2A)\r\nAction Owner\r\nDue Date\r\nOther Persons Affected\r\n2A-1.
