      "SummaryText": "Springfield Pipeline, LLC (Springfield) owns and operates the Catarina South CPF-A. The Catarina South CPF-A is located in a remote area and is not normally occupied. The facility is newly constructed and will receive production from area oil and gas wells. The facility consists of an inlet-separator (scrubber), multiple natural gas fired compressor engines with blowcase, produced water storage tanks, glycol dehydration unit, and piping and valves.\r\n\r\nProduced gas from off-site production wells is sent to the facility. Approximately 15 MMscfd of natural gas enters the facility and passes through an inlet separator. Gas entering the facility is sweet with less than 10 ppmv H2S. The facility has a Sulfa Treat Package (no emission) to ensure pipeline quality spec of < 4 ppmv.  Small amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL) from the natural gas are physically separated within a separator and NGL are sent off site via pipeline. Produced water from the glycol dehydrator, inlet scrubber and various atmospheric blowpots is stored in two atmospheric tanks and is transported offsite via truck.\r\n\r\nThe water containing a very small concentration of hydrocarbon from the reboiler still column vent is condensed through a fin-fan condenser. The remaining non-condensable gas is used as fuel in the reboiler burner or routed to an igniter on the burner discharge. Flash tank gas from the dehydration unit is sent to the reboiler. Dry gas exiting the dehydration unit, not used onsite as fuel, is sent to sales. The NGL product is temporarily stored in a pressurized bullet tank with a volume of 30,000 gallons and operating pressure at approximately 200 psi.\r\n\r\nA total rupture of the 30,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Catarina South CPF-A. The 30,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.5 miles. Because no public receptors"

If an emergency involving the Catarina South CPF-A NGL product tank occurs, the Springfield policy is to notify the Dimmit County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the fire department."
