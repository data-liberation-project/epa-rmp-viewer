Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at La Porte Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all chemicals including regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur primary activities encompass The Dow Chemical Company facility in La Porte, Texas, which is in the chemical manufacturing business.  The basic products manufactured at the site include Methylene Diphenyldiisocyanate based (MDI based) polymeric isocyanates, polyol systems, related polyurethane elastomers and foams, and phosgene.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility, which are involved in several uses. These substances include Chlorine, Formaldehyde (solution), and Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride].  Chlorine is used for phosgene production.  Formaldehyde (solution) is used for polymeric amine production.  Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is used for polymeric isocyanate production.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 20000 lb. while Formaldehyde (solution), and Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] are present at our facility in quantities of 184000 lb.,and 17346.00 lb. respectively.  \n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "itigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed Phast version 5.1.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Polymeric MDI Production.  In this scenario 17346 lb. of liquid Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 20 % of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.00081 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Phosgene Production Plant of 20000 lb. of liquid Chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s), firewater monitor(s), and emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the release to a 10-minute duration.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 6.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] involves a release from Polymeric MDI Production of 1635 lb. of phosgene gas. The release is also assumed to be controlled by deluge system(s), scrubber(s), emergency shutdown system(s) and steam curtain.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of stopping the release in ten minutes a"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.00081 mg/L of Phosgene  [Carbonic dichloride] is 4.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (solution) involves a release from Polymeric MDI Production.  The scenario involves the release of 11440 lb. of 50% Formaldehyde solution from a broken transfer hose.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) and sumps(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of reducing the surface area of the liquid pool.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of stopping the release after ten minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of Formaldehyde (solution) is 1.1 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe La Porte Site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the La Porte site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe La Porte Site maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.
