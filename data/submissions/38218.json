To prevent a chlorine gas release, the Commission has implemented stringent cylinder loading and unloading, chlorine system operation and preventive maintenance procedures to prevent cylinder damage, equipment failure or human error that could result in the accidental release of chlorine gas.  In addition, the DRUC has installed an active mitigation system (chlorine gas scrubber system) as well as leak prevention and detection equipment to protect employee and environmental safety.\nAll DRUC employees have been fully trained in the safe and proper procedures for handling chlorine cylinders.  Cylinders are never loaded, unloaded or moved unless a trained team of employees is present to ensure safety procedures are followed.  All maintenance is also performed by teams of trained DRUC personnel to protect both worker safety and to prevent accidental release or equipment damage.  All equipment is mechanical integrity checked and leak tested before being placed into operation.\nThe DRUC Prevention Program includes extensive process safety information, process hazard analysis information, operating procedures, training programs, mechanical integrity verification, management of change procedures, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and a contractor management program.",

The DRUC is committed to providing pure and plentiful potable water to the Manchester and Tullahoma communities as well as protecting the safety of its employees, the community and the environment.  The Commission takes great pride in observing standard industrial safety precautions in preventing hazards in the workplace, and implementing fail-safe contingency plans in the unlikely event of a mishap.  This two-pronged approach includes the following:\n1.  The latest technology in process controls, monitoring and detection systems. \n2.  Active and passive mitigation systems designed to eliminate and/or defuse the impact of leakage, fire, or explosion and other hazards.\nThe DRUC stores and utilizes one-ton cylinders of liquefied chlorine gas for the disinfection processes at the water treatment plant.  There are normally four to six full and two to four empty cylinders stored at the facility inside a secure brick and block building.  These containers of liquefied chlorine are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Plan program. \nThe DRUC has an excellent accident and chemical release prevention program.  The reportable spill or release history of the Commission includes zero spillage, zero deaths, and zero worker injuries.  The DRUC has implemented stringent loading, operation and maintenance procedures to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas.\nThe DRUC Emergency Response Program has been evaluated to produce the maximum impact in the least amount of time.  The DRUC has coordinated with all local governments and fire departments to provide effective communications and rapid response in an emergency situation.  The DRUC staff will respond immediately to a release event by taking the following basic actions: \n1.Remotely engage active m"
