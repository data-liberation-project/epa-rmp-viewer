Facility Accidental Release Policy\n     The owners, management, and employees of United Agri Products West facility at 4502 East Mt. Whitney, Laton California 93242 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,  the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to migrate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people ant the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n2.  Facility Information\n      a.  The primary activity at the United Agri Products West facility is the storage, blending, and sales of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of prepackaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n      b.  The regulated substance Anhydrous Ammonia is received by trucks stored in 60,000 gallon tanks then loaded into field tanks for crop production nutrients.\n      c.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck.  The Maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at United Agri Products West is 60,000 pounds.\n3.  The Worst-Case release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n     The Worst-Case release Scenario.  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 60,000  pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.83 miles\n     Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario,  based on the five-year accident history is a release from United Agri Products West.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.25 miles.\n4.  Five Year Accident History\n     There have been no accidental release or near misses of Anhydrous Ammonia or Regulated Pesticides  in the past five years that:\n      a.  have caused any deaths, injuries, or signif"

The Emergency Responce  Program\n      The facility's emergency responce program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n      - OSHA 29 CFR 1910.35;\n      - OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n      - Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Healty and Saftey Code.\n6.   Planned Changes to Improve Saftey\n      Saftey improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the Anhydrous Ammonia Processes at the  facility or the handeling of Regulated Pesticides."
