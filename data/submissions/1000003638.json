In this capacity, the SHE Manager coordinates preplanning of emergency services with the LEPC, local health care facilities, police department, various fire departments and contracted spill response teams.  \n\nFor large scale releases of regulated substances this facility would rely upon 911 emergency response services provided by the local and regional fire departments.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe have a multi-year phased approach for continuously improving the safety of our operations.  Examples of this include:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe systematic replacement of carbon steel process equipment with stainless steel.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tUpgrading early warning systems to increase the sites abilities to respond even more quickly.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tUpgrading fire protection and other mitigation systems."
