              "Description": "The process consists of and ethylene oxide (EO) rail car, a propylene oxide (PO) tankwagon, two centrifugal pumps (one for EO and one for PO) for transferring to and from an EO bulk storage tank (T22), a PO bulk storage tank (T-19), three intermediate receivers (day tanks), two positive displacement pumps for transferring EO/PO between the intermediate receivers and from the intermediate receivers to the reactors, three reactors and the piping connecting the above-mentioned components.\n\nCommon to all components of the system is a twenty point organic vapor monitoring device that alarms at 7.5 ppm.  Three water cannons and sprinkler system are present to supress fire and vapor release.  \n\nThe temperature of the EO railcar is monitored twice a day.  A catch plate is postioned under the EO railcar contain small leaks.  \n\nThe centifugal pumps have double mechanical seals with a low barrier fluid shutoff, a high and low amperage shutoff, and a high temperture shutoff. \n\nBulk EO storage tank (T-22) and Bulk storage tank (T-19) have high and low level alarms, high and low pressure alarms, and a high temperature alarm.  T-22 is positioned in a concrete bunker and is also equipped with its own water deluge system.  T-19 is positoned within a concrete diked area.  \n\nIntermediate storage vessels are equipped with high and low pressure alarms and high temperature alarms.  These vessels are also protected with a water sprinkler system.  \n\nPumps to the reactors are equipped with bypasses that operate automatically should the pumps experience high pressure.  \n\nReactors are positioned on load cells and are equipped with high temperature and high pressure alarms.  \n\nPiping used for EO and PO is schedule 80 pipe capable of withstanding corrosion.  The piping is painted and in open areas insultated as well to protect the piping from the heat of the sun.",
