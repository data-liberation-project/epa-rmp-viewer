This program outlines results of the Township?s hazard assessment and off-site consequence analyses for the Program 2 toxic substance chlorine stored on site in amounts greater than 2,500 pounds.  The program was put in place to identify the consequences of an accident or spill which could be hazardous to nearby populations.  It outlines the steps to follow should an incident occur and identifies the off-site consequences of the worst and alternate case incidents.\n \nThe document is intended for use by plant personnel to provide written documentation on procedures, training and management of possible chlorine releases.  Training occurs yearly and for new employees.  The Program is an integral part of on-going safety programs and as such is incorporated into any programs already in existence.\n\nThe operating procedures, safety checklists and report forms can be supplied individually or in total to new employees or used in refresher courses for updating current employees on the safe handling and response for chlorine use.\n\nSpringettsbury Township has assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation and integration of the Risk Management Program to the Emergency Coordinators.  Additional individuals have been assigned responsibility for implementing individual requirements and will report to an Emergency Coordinator on these matters.  Responsible individuals will communicate information to other employees involved in operation and maintenance of the regulated process as required.\n\nTwo two scenarios were evaluated:a ?Worst Case Release Scenario? and an ?Alternate Release Scenario.? to determine the consequences of an accidental chlorine release at the Springettsbury Township WWTF.\n\nThere have been incident reports regarding the Srpingettsbury To"
