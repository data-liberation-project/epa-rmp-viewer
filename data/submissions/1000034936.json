The DSC Plant is located in Conroe, Texas and is situated on approximately 44 acres. The DSC Plant began production of Soltex Additive in batch operations in 1978, and was then owned by Chromalloy. The facility was sold in 1983, to Drilling Specialties Co. LLC, a subsidiary of Phillips Petroleum Company.  In 1987 the DSC Plant converted to continuous operations.  The facility is currently a division of the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP as the result of a joint venture in 2001.\n\n\n\nThe DSC Plant is required to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) because the facility stores and uses Sulfur Trioxide in excess of the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR Part 68. The DSC Plant uses Sulfur Trioxide (SO3) to manufacture Soltex Additive, a drilling mud additive. The DSC Plant is subject to the RMP Program 3 reporting requirements as defined in 40 CFR Part 68 because the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard set forth  in 29 CFR Subpart 1910.119.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management at the DSC Plant complies with the requirements of both the OSHA PSM Standard and EPA RMP regulation.

The site was originally certified as a STAR worksite in 2008. This voluntary program is a partnership between OSHA and industry to recognize and encourage excellence and continuous improvement in safety programs. STAR certification represents the highest form of recognition OSHA can give a company for outstanding safety performance.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTIONS:\n\n\n\nThe Chemical specific preventions for SO3 unloading include using two operators to start the unloading process, clear the line, connect and disconnect lines and purging.  At least one operator is in attendance during the entire SO3 unloading process, which allows for isolation of the system remotely if needed.  An automatic shut-off valve is mounted at the unloading station to quickly shutoff the unloading process if needed. The unloading hoses are stainless steel braided hoses with additional support to prevent unnecessary binding or crimping. The transfer hoses are replaced every year to ensure hose integrity.  Video camera monitoring by the control room allows for an additional set of eyes to monitor system integrity during unloading operation.   The DSC Plant also consults with external subject matter experts on the safe handling and storage of SO3 to ensure the facility's equipment and practices are up-to-date with the manufacturers recommended best practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAlarm Systems \n\nThe DSC Plant has an internal plant wide alarm system for fires and emergencies.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Responders\n\nThe DSC Plant has an Emergency Response Plan for handling releases of hazardous substances.
