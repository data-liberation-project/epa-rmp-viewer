      "SummaryText": "    Executive Summary\n    1. Description of Stationary Source\n    John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is the major NASA installation for launch operations and related programs in support of manned space missions.  The KSC core business is to provide space system processes, test, and launch techniques and to develop associated technologies.  The day-to-day operation of KSC is managed by NASA KSC personnel with support provided by contractors.\n    KSC spans approximately 220 square miles on the east central coast of Florida.  Only a very small part of the total acreage of KSC has been developed or designated for NASA operational and industrial use.  Because Merritt Island was found to include prime habitat for unique and endangered wildlife, NASA entered into an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to establish a wildlife preserve, known as the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR), within the boundaries of KSC.  In addition, an agreement with the Department of Interior (USDI) caused most of the Canaveral National Seashore (CNS) to fall within KSC when the CNS was created by Public Law 93-626.\n    2. NASA Prevention Programs\n    Two of KSC?s four guiding principles are ?Safety and Health First? and ?Environmental Leadership?.  KSC is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program has been developed throughout KSC to minimize the potential for fires, explosions, and accidental releases of highly hazardous, toxic, flammable, reactive, or explosive chemicals and receives full support of management and involvement of employees at all levels.  The PSM program prevents chemical accidents from occurring and ensures that facility operations remain safe to work team members and the general public.  The program achieves this goal by taking a comprehensive approach, which involves integrating technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The program is based on the principle that facilities will remain s"

The first priority of USA is the safe operation of the Space Shuttle while maintaining the safety of the people.  USA?s Safety and Health plan (SFOC-PA0001) identifies the organizational structure and methodology to ensure the preservation of human and material resources through an orderly, coordinated, and comprehensive institutional safety program.  USA has documented plans in place to manage the risks involved in the day-to-day activities of shuttle processing.  These plans include:  The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) Risk Management Plan which describes the polices, concepts, and approach related to the management of risks in the Space Shuttle Program, the Associate Program Manager (APM) Implementation Plan Blank Book, which provides the structure and direction for the SFOC organizational elements to develop their detailed implementation plans and the Ground Operations Implementation Plan, which documents the implementation of the Risk Management Program into Ground Operations.  This implementation plan defines the processes and procedures for the identification, assessment, handling and communication of risks associated with the Ground Operations function. \n    \n    There are many procedures/mechanisms that are established for the prevention of accidental releases of various hazardous/toxic/regulated chemicals, some of which include:\n    \n?

Emergency Response Approach\n\nKSC has developed a Comprehensive Emergency Preparedness Plan (CEMP) that is coordinated with all response elements, both on Center and Brevard County Emergency Management. This includes the State Emergency Response Commissions, District VI, Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This plan is the guideline for KSC?s dynamic emergency preparedness program and is designed to be supplemented by other emergency plans and standard operating procedures required by all internal emergency response elements at KSC.  KSC employs full-time fire, law enforcement, medical, emergency management, and hazardous materials emergency response capability with all required support elements.  KSC?s policy is to provide \"minimum essential\" capabilities for responding to the full spectrum of emergencies.  Baseline capabilities are maintained during normal duty circumstances that can be rapidly expanded in the event of an emergency.  \n\nTo validate the CEMP, tabletop, functional, and full-scale exercises are conducted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.  The emergency preparedness program is managed by a Certified Emergency Manager with a staff of 6 personnel.  Drills and exercises are developed and conducted by an exercise evaluation team.  Drills and exercises are conducted to validate the Kennedy Documented Procedures (KDPs) listed in the CEMP.  Our KDPs are compliant with ISO 9001 Certification.  \n\nIn addition to the KSC area-wide alert system, KSC has also developed a Standard Operating Procedure with the State of Florida, State Warning P"

Regulated Substances Handled\nKSC stores Monomethyl Hydrazine (MMH) over the threshold amount.  MMH is used as a propellant in the Orbital Maneuvering System/Reaction Control System (OMS/RCS).  It is delivered to KSC by tankers and stored and processed at the Fuel Storage Area No. 1 (FSA-1) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS).  The tankers hold a maximum capacity of 2,500 gallons (18,335 lbs).  FSA-1 has modified the tanker staging facility to receive and stage regulated quantities of MMH above the threshold value of 2,066 gallons within a containment of 1,083-square feet that drains into a covered sump.  Two storage tank bays of the Facility 77800 were modified to accept the parking of 2500-gallon DOT MC-338 (exempted tankers) that has an access ramp to provide controlled drainage into the facility sump.  MMH processing of 2,500 gallon (18,335 lbs) tankers at FSA-1 is performed at facility 77800, processing area, and remains a covered process of the RMP rule.  These tankers are typically in route to another facility at CCAFS or KSC and require weigh-in or processing at FSA-1 prior to delivery.  Processing of a tanker is not considered storage.\nAt Launch Complex A and B, MMH is stored at the Hypergol fuel facility and the maximum intended inventory is 55,845 lbs. MMH is delivered to the launch pads in 2,500 gallon tankers (18,335 lbs) which are off-loaded to the larger storage tank at each pad. \nDescription of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nFSA-1 Monomethyl Hydrazine Process:\nThe worst-case release scenario is rupture of a 2,500-gallon tanker during storage, releasing 18,335 lbs of monomethyl hydrazine.

Under worst-case weather conditions, taking into consideration the passive mitigation and using the EPA?s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (published May 24, 1996), the monomethyl hydrazine fumes could travel 2.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or the environment.  At this distance the radius of impact remains inside the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) property, and public receptors that will be affected include:  the Banana River and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Visitor?s Center.  No residential areas are located in the area of concern.\nThe MMH tankers are a MC-338 type jacketed pressure vessel.  Although there may be several tankers onsite, stored near each other, each tanker is designed to be an independent facility.  They are designed to DOT classification DOT-E-10631, for the transportation of hypergolic Fuels.  They have an inner and outer vessel made of SA 240 Grade 304L stainless steel.  The tankers are designed with a relief system and can withstand front and side impacts of 55 miles per hour and a fall of 50 feet without any puncture of the inner vessel.  The tankers are also designed to withstand immersion into a fire of 681 to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit without danger of a BLEVE, or Boiling Liquid Expansion Vapor Explosion.  The worst-case scenario, therefore, is highly unlikely.\nThe alternative release scenario for the MMH tanker was derived from experience, estimations and input from various groups including Safety.  Due to active and passive controls in place, the credible spill can be limited to 8 ounces.  Engineering controls are used to minimize any release.  Generally, the processes are considered ?closed systems?, i.e. connections are made with valves closed and there is no free flow of liquid through the atmosphere.

Planned changes to improve safety\nKSC is in the process of making a major cultural change on how safety is implemented at this center. Historically, we have relied on a large safety organization to provide hands-on safety support to major hazardous operations. This has served the center well but reviews with outside industry indicate that additional improvements can only be made by empowering the line organizations with the responsibility to conduct their operations safely. This cultural change is being implemented through classroom training such as the DuPont STOP Program, Policy Statements released by the Center Director, and with progress monitored by a Cultural Shift Steering Committee composed of the first line Directors. \nWithin the past year the Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate established a KSC Human Factors Office chartered with establishing a center wide Integrated Process Team to embed human factors concepts and methodologies into all organizations. This is being accomplished through training, providing root cause analysis and lessons learned for close calls and incidents as well as incorporation of human factor elements into the IRIS mishap reporting system.\nThe KSC Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate is in the process of implementing a major reorganization that will consolidate functions therefore allowing for increased efficiencies with the existing manpower resources."
