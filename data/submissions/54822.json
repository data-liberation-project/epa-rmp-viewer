La Porte, Texas Plant (?Noltex?) is a manufacturer of ethylene vinyl alcohol co-polymers (EVOH).  EVOH is used in packaging food and other products requiring preservation through the use of an oxygen barrier.  Noltex uses vinyl acetate (a listed RMP toxic chemical) and ethylene (a listed RMP flammable chemical), along with other non-RMP-regulated chemicals in the manufacture of EVOH.  Noltex is located on approximately 20 acres, employs approximately 100 company personnel, approximately 40 contract maintenance personnel.  Access to the facility is controlled and limited to employees, contractors, consultants, and escorted visitors.  Noltex complies with all applicable safety, process safety, environmental, and transportation regulations related to the manufacture and distribution of EVOH.\n\n\n\nNoltex has expressed the desire and commitment to safe operation of the facility in the Noltex Vision and Mission Statements and the Noltex Quality Policy.  The porocess safety systems at Noltex are managed as comprehensive and integrated unit.  Because Noltex is quality driven, the plant maintains living documents and audits all aspects of our operations on a very frequent basis.  Noltex applies the principles of continuous improvement to all its management practices.  The Noltex release prevention program applies to all processes and chemicals used at Noltex and includes such diverse elements as: employee selection criteria; technical specifications which meet or exceed codes, standards, regulations, and common industry practices; fabrication and construction quality control; employee training programs in safety, environmental, process safety, process operations, and emergency response; standard operating procedures in operating and maintaining the facility; maintenance of process and mechanical integrity; employee involvement in safety and emerge"

Along with the release prevention elements listed above, the EVOH process is highly controlled via the computer-based distributed control system.  Many process vessels have redundant alarms and interlocks (i.e., temperature as well as pressure, level as well as temperature, etc.). \n\n\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analyzes for toxic and flammable chemicals were performed using commercially available software models and the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.  The values for endpoint radii for our worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios were taken as the greater of the values determined from the two methods. At this plant, Vinyl Acetate is the potential toxic release chemical, and ethylene is the potential flammable release chemical.  These are the two (2) chemicals that required under the RMP Regulations. These analysis were performed in 1998 and reviewed in 2014 for the RMP re-submittal.  The worst release scenario was updated slightly.  The facility has two processes that contain vinyl acetate monomer. In previous submittals the two processes were mixed in Section 3.  The report was updated to reflect only the worst case scenario regarding the release of pure vinyl acetate monomer.  \n\n \n\nThe worst case scenario for vinyl acetate involves the instantaneous release of the 26,329 gallons (210,000 pounds) from a tank which is contained within a dike capable of holding the released material.  This results in a release rate of 200.0 pounds of vinyl acetate per minute for sixty minutes.  This scenario would cause a vapor cloud to go offsite, which could affect the surrounding community.  No administrative controls related to tank level management and no passive mitigation other than the dike were considered in the development of the scenario although the release prevention pr"

No passive mitigation is considered, but active mitigation through the efforts of the process operators and emergency response team are expected to control the release within ten minutes although evaporation will continue for approximately one-half hour.  This could produce a vapor cloud, which could travel offsite, but would be expected to have minimal impact on our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for ethylene is the loss of 9,000 pounds of ethylene from the process, forming a flammable vapor cloud, which detonates with a ten per cent (10%) efficiency.  The endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (?psi?) overpressure stays predominantly within the Noltex property boundary.  No administrative or passive mitigation was considered, although the release prevention program is fully implemented for the process.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ethylene involves the release of 9,000 pounds of ethylene from the process in fifteen (15) minutes, producing a flammable vapor cloud, which reaches to a distance of approximately 100 feet.  Thus, the flammable range of the cloud stays entirely on Noltex property.\n\n\n\nNoltex maintains an emergency response team comprised of approximately 32 employees.  The various members receive training in incident command, fire-fighting, hazardous material emergency response, and medical emergency treatment.  Written safety, environmental, process safety management, and emergency response procedures are always available for review by all employees.
