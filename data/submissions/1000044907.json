The furan liquid is assumed to be immediately released from which evaporation takes place.  \r\n\r\nTwo alternative release scenarioa are also included for furan as part of the Program 3 processes. The alternative release scenario allows use of active and passive mitigation. The alternative release scenario evaluates the five-year accident history (see section 5 below) to evaluate potential scenarios. In the previous 5 years, the facility had one release, and we have added this incident to our alternative release scenarios.\r\n\r\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State Building codes.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 including the one containing furan.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nPennakem, LLC Memphis Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is either HAZOP or What-if Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in enginee"

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary for Pennakem, LLC Memphis, Tennessee Facility\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Pennakem LLC Memphis Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is evidenced by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, the Memphis site utilizes the highly trained Shelby County Emergency Response Team to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are completely coordinated with Memphis-Shelby County LEPC on all incidents that may impact the community. \r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Organic chemical synthesis.  We have 1 RMP substance regulated at our facility.  The substance is Furan, which is involved in several uses.  Furan is used for chemical synthesis and is then converted into other organic compounds or sold as a commercial chemical product.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. In order to perform the required off-site consequence analysis the Pennakem Memphis facility used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance, as well as RMP*Comp.  While Pennakem Memphis has excellent programs to respond to a release of furan, this worst case scenario does not allow any active mitigation to be considered, and further requires the release to occur under conditions that are not indicative of any conditions which have been encountered.
