An emergency operation support team includes site safety officers, safety coordinators, fire and rescue teams, and medical personnel. This team is responsible for enforcing safety and precautionary policies. In addition to active prevention, the emergency operation teams also prepare plans and response procedures in the case of an emergency.  White Sands Missile Range maintains four fire stations, each staffed with HAZMAT-trained personnel.  Station 1 is located at the White Sands Post Headquarters and services main post and lower range areas.  Station 1 would respond in the event of a Lance Missile Motor accident located at the munitions storage area.  A total of 21 HAZMAT-trained personnel are stationed at Station 1 on Main Post.  Station 2 is located at Launch Complex 37 and provides emergency response to the missile launch complex areas in the vicinity of Nike Road, east of Main Post.  A total of 8 HAZMAT-trained personnel are stationed at Station 2.  Station 3, located at Stallion Range Center, maintains 8 HAZMAT-trained personnel and services the upper range areas, north of Main Post.  Station 4 is located at the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility located along Hwy 70, northeast of Main Post, and maintains 4 HAZMAT-trained personnel.   A total of 61 (57 HAZMAT-trained) fire fighters are stationed at WSMR.\n\nA description of the facility and regulated substances handled.\nWhite Sands Missile range is an installation of the US Army and conducts testing and evaluation of military and commercial systems.  The operation at White Sands that is covered by the Risk Management Program regulation (40 CFR, Part 68) is the storage of Lance Missiles Motors that contain inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA).

      "SummaryText": " but does not exist in quantities that will exceed the threshold.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\nWhite Sands complies with the U.S. Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) when handling and storing munitions of any type. The DDESB standards are designed to minimize the potential for harm to human health and the environment.  In addition to this protective and stringent regulation, the White Sands Fire Department is equipped with a First Responders Chemical and Hazardous Materials Response Vehicle. This vehicle is equipped with state of the art communications and response equipment. The Lance Missile Motors are inspected monthly by onsite personnel for leaks or malfunctions. Also, a written Environmental Spill and Disaster Control Plan, updated 29 September 1997 and field-tested 1 March 1999, is in place and ready for implementation in case of an accidental release.\n\nFive-year accident history.\nWithin the past five years, White Sands has had no accidental releases from the Lance Missiles Motors.  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.\n\nThe emergency response program.\nIn the event of fire, explosion, or release of a regulated substance from the Lance Missile Motors, the White Sands Fire Department is fully trained and prepared to respond. The White Sands Fire Department would be the first responders in the event of an accidental release (fire, explosion, spill, etc.) at the Lance Missile Motor storage facility. They have planned and prepared for all possible release scenarios of the Lance Missile Motors.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\nWhite Sands Missile Range emergency response personnel will continue to undergo regular training. All personnel will also continue to be informed of emergency response procedures and there personal responsibilities. "
