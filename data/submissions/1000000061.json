KNC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  Periodically, ammonium polyphosphate is produced at the facility through the use of a portable unit that is brought into the plant.  Carbon dioxide, a by-product of the ammonia manufacturing process, is sold to a co-located third party (EPCO) as a gas, liquefied in the facility's CO2 plant and sold, used in the UAN plant, or vented to the atmosphere.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that"

An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 Prevention Program requirements.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\nA?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\nA?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\nA?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\nA?    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped minimize the severity of chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nA?    Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\nA?    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) in place.\nA?    Providing a low-amp trip system to shut down ammonia loading pumps during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia.\nA?    In"

Manning the facility 24 hours a day to monitor all loading operations.\nA?    Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\nA?    Equipping the rail loading scale with an automatic shutdown that will prohibit further product movement upon reaching the weight of a full railcar.  \nA?    Requiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnected.\nA?    Providing level indications on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\nA?    Providing a fire water system to help with vapor control in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release.\n\n    \n    Five-Year Accident History\n    \n    Within the last five years, the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant has experienced four incidents that may be reportable in the five-year accident history of the RMP regulation.  The first incident occurred on June 27, 2006 and resulted in an informal shelter-in-place for individuals nearby the plant who could smell ammonia vapor or may have experienced eye irritation.  The second occurred on January 9, 2008 and resulted in injuries that required medical treatment.  The third incident occurred on October 1, 2008 and resulted in the evacuation of employees from a nearby industrial facility.  The fourth incident occurred on August 22, 2010 and resulted in injuries that required medical treatment as well as significant onsite property damage.\n    \n    It is not clear that the June 2006 incident is reportable under the RMP regulation, as KNC does not have information that qualifies the incident for report"

Nevertheless, KNC is reporting this incident in the RMP.  \n    \n    \n    Emergency Response Program\n    \n    The facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any necessary emergency response actions with the Beatrice Rural Fire Department and the Gage County Sheriff Department.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Beatrice Hazardous Materials Team, Beatrice Community Hospital, the Nebraska State Patrol, Norris Public Power, Kinder Morgan and Black Hills Energy (natural gas suppliers).  The Beatrice Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.
