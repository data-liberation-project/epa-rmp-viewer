The safe management of chemical products is considered priority to minimize the risk to our community, environment, and personnel.\r\nAdditionally, Chemsolv(R), Inc. manages the facility in compliance with all Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (DEQ) and the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) regulations.\r\nTo ensure the facility continues to operate in a safe and responsible manner in compliance with all regulations, an extensive risk management system has been developed and integrated into our operating procedures.\r\nSignificant components of the system include training, operating procedures for chemical handling, inspection, maintenance, emergency response, and incident management. These procedures provided to responsible personnel and management's continual compliance oversight ensures safe chemical management.\r\nThe President, Regulatory Affairs Manager, and the Plant Manager are designated as having the primary responsibility and accountability to ensure the plan and all components are in compliance and implemented.\r\n\r\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility is used for receipt, storage, package, and distribution of chemical products.  There is no reactive chemistry conducted at the site.\r\nBoth liquid and dry chemicals are received, relabeled, repackaged, bulked, blended, and placed in storage for shipment to industrial, agricultural, government, food, and cosmetic customers."

The aqua ammonia is no longer bulked into an above ground storage tank.  The drums are palletized and single or double stacked in an area with limited access away from traffic. \r\nIsopropylamine arrives at the facility by tanker and is repackaged into 55-gal drums or bulked into a single above ground storage tank. Only senior, experienced operators can work with the isopropylamine. The drums are palletized, single or double stacked in an area with limited access away from traffic, and made to order, no drum storage for stock.\r\nFormaldehyde was removed from the Chemsolv RMP during this update due to it having a vapor pressure less than 10 mm Hg. Formaldehyde does not have a concentration cutoff but is listed with the qualifier solution.  According to 40 CFR 68.115, the amount of any listed toxic substance present in a mixture at a concentration greater than 1% does not need to be included in a threshold quantity determination if it can be shown that the partial vapor pressure is < 10 mm Hg (https://emergencymanagement.zendesk.com).\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon employee training, chemical safety awareness, equipment and facility management.\r\nTraining includes both the classroom environment and observation by management to verify competency. Classes are designed to achieve maximum results within the time period on an annual basis. Knowledge is evaluated by both verbal questioni"

The PRA is required for all non-routine work, requires two people to issue and release, and allows us to systematically identify and control hazards in the workplace. This system does not change the original prohibition of No hot work near any covered process but emphasizes and enforces this safeguard to include ALL flammable processes.\r\nPlan updates are the result of coordination with local responders, inspections by regulatory agencies, training sessions, process changes, and new risk management programs and regulations enacted by the government.\r\nPresently all areas are being studied to identify technically, procedurally and economically feasible passive and active risk management strategies to further enhance the safe operation of the facility."

The program provides training for hazardous incident recognition, personnel protection equipment selection and use, characteristics of hazardous chemicals and the methods for response, cleanup and decontamination.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPlans are continually updated to improve management of chemicals and reduce the risks associated with handling chemical products.\r\nChemsolv(R), Inc. just initiated a major improvement to its risk management through the implementation of a Chemsolv Safe Work Permits & Preliminary Risk Analysis (PRA) on 9/28/2018 that utilizes a checklist format and consolidates all work permits under one system. It asks the same questions that a thorough job briefing would ask, but in a systematic way by guiding through the major hazards in a checklist form. We review the checklist at the work site and mark which hazards are present. Yellow hazards must be addressed during the completion of the step by step job plan, Red hazards require the completion of the appropriate work permit. The permits are basically additional checklists for the special hazards that are identified. The step by step plan analyzes the work for the hazards of each step. The hazards are identified and what will be done to control them. These are assigned to an individual a"
