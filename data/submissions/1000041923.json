We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation\n\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n\n *  An overview of improvements made at the facility to minimize the potential for accidental chemical releases that could adversely affect our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n *  Certifications in accordance with RMP rule \n\n *  Relevant details about risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\nOur facility produces polypropylene using multiple chemicals and unit operations.  The process utilizes the regulated flammable substance propylene along with catalysts, hydrogen and ethylene as feedstocks.  The process contains the RMP-regulated substance propylene above the threshold quantity in storage vessels and reactors, columns, tanks and piping within the unit.  The process also utilizes titanium tetrachloride and triethyl aluminum in quantities well below the RMP threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards  to our employees, the public, and the environment otherwise posed by our use of these chemi"

This is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n *  Process safety information\n\n *  Process hazard analysis\n\n *  Operating procedures\n\n *  Training\n\n *  Mechanical integrity\n\n *  Management of change\n\n *  Pre-startup safety review\n\n *  Compliance audits\n\n *  Incident investigation\n\n *  Employee participation\n\n *  Hot work permit\n\n *  Contractors\n\n\n\nWe actively encourage participation by all employees in process safety management.  Relevant process safety information  is readily available to employees.  Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies consistent with Management of Change Program.  Procedures are set up to provide knowledge to ensure employees perform their jobs safely and correctly.  Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged.  Experienced employees are involved in training.  Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\n\n\n\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change policy, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews ensure that new installations or modifications are safe for startup and continued operation.  Our Mechanical Integrity Program includes written procedures to assure that affected process equipment is properly and safely maintained.  The La Porte Plant's Hot Work Permit policy is consistently enforced to prevent hot work in potentially dangerous areas.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to minimize the potential for accidental chemical releases.  Our comp"

      "SummaryText": "any and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have established specific accountabilities and controls in support of our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  In the past five years, there have been no releases of propylene or other chemicals at the La Porte Plant that have had an adverse impact on employees, the community, or the environment.  If an incident were to occur, we would conduct formal incident investigations designed to identify and address the root cause of the events.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nWe have developed and maintain an emergency response plan which includes planning and training elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and community emergency response plans (LEPC).  \n\n\n\nRECENT CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we have implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n\n\n- VPP STAR site, completed 3 year re-certification in 2013 \n\n- Extended muster system electronic headcount system\n\n- Structured Safety program rollout 2009\n\n- New Fire pumps 2009\n\n- Use of LOPA methodology for site PHA revalidations\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBraskem believe in a philosophy of continuous improvement.  A number of programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and continually seek opportunities to improve.  The facility maintains employee safety teams that meet regularly and a structured safety process.\n\n\n\n- Restructure the behavior-based Structured Safety Program (SMP) using TIPS 2 Software\n\n- Revise and standardize the LOTO Energy Isolation Program to include equipment specific checklis"

The WCS considers the same storage vessel but is now based on 100% propylene and does not consider any administrative control to restrict maximum volume.  The result 1 psi circle remains significantly short of the nearest residents.\n\n\n\nREVISION OF SITE MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\n\n\nThe maximum intended on-site inventory of propylene has been reduced from 2.9 mmlbs to 2.5 mmlbs due to the shutdown of B-Line polypropylene production.  The maximum on-site inventory of propane remains at 170,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n"
