Although the company takes pride in that record, we place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to reduce the risk of accidents and ensure this record continues.  \n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN INFORMATION\nThe Facility maintains a written EAP, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the LPG or NGL handling and storage operations, the EAP will be followed.  Activation of this EAP sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies.  Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly.  All agencies and personnel respond to pre-determined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the central Command Post (CP).

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation \nThe Facility promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Facility periodically conducts audits to determine whether procedures and practices required by the Accident Prevention Program are being implemented.

Scheduled preventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or facility management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nThe Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nThe Facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one (1) additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Facility has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in Facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced o"

The Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The Facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  The Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensu"

Because the processes at the plant are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\nEmployee Participation\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program are important steps toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  The Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.).  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  Process safety information is useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, an"
