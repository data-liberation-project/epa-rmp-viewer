      "SummaryText": "Milliken Chemical, a Division of Milliken and Company owns and operates the Dewey Plant.  The Dewey Plant is a specialty chemical batch operation located in Inman, which is approximately 7 miles north of Spartanburg in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe first priority of the Dewey Plant is the health and safety of its associates and the surrounding community.  OSHA recognized the Dewey Plant as a Star site in 1994 and has re-certified this classification since then, in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2008, and 2011.  Of equal importance is protection of the environment.  To this end significant resources are committed to ensuring complete compliance with all regulations and that the plant is operated in a manner that protects the quality of our environment.  \r\n\r\nThe U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulates Ethylene Oxide when it is stored in quantities in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The Dewey Plant is subject to the regulation due to the fact that Ethylene Oxide is stored on site in excess of this threshold quantity.  Ethylene Oxide is received by rail car and is stored in a storage tank.  Ethylene Oxide is a building block chemical used to manufacture a wide variety of industrial chemicals including, lubricants, surfactants, industrial intermediates used in coatings, colorant manufacture, and a variety of other applications.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Dewey Plant stores Propylene Oxide and Phosphorous Oxychloride in excess of the regulatory thresholds, 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds respectively.   Propylene Oxide is received by rail car or tank truck and is stored in a storage tank and Phosphorous Oxychloride is received and stored in drums.\r\n\r\nPropylene Oxide is also a building block chemical used in the manufacture of products similar to those of Ethylene Oxide.  Phosphorous Oxychloride is also a building block chemical, which is used in the manufacture of flame-retardants, pharmaceutical ingredients, agricultural products, and colorants which are used in urethane foams.\r\n\r\nThe Dewey Pl"

      "SummaryText": "ant is committed to the education and training of all associates in the area of safety and emergency response.  For this reason, plant associates are ready to respond in the event of an emergency.  Plant associates are trained to respond to both fire and hazardous material emergencies.  In addition, the plant has worked closely with the North Spartanburg Fire Department to ensure that they are prepared to respond in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Dewey Plant is committed to minimizing the potential for safety incidents, which would affect the plant associates and / or neighbors.  To this end, monitoring systems have been installed for early detection of leaks in order that preventive action may be taken.  In addition, leak detection is conducted quarterly in specific areas to check all potential fugitive leak points.  An extensive maintenance program allows for regular inspection and detection of recurring problems.  The training provided to our associates on procedures, regulations, and processes helps to minimize the potential for safety incidents.\r\n\r\nWhile the possibility of an accident at the Dewey Plant exists, the potential is low and Milliken Chemical takes preventative actions to minimize the possibility of an accident occurring.  There have been no reportable accidents in the last 5 years."
