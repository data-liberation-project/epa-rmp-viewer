      "SummaryText": "The Reading Area Water Authority's (RAWA) Off-Site Emergency Response Plan involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  This plan details the emergency response policy and is tailored to the facility and emergency response services available in Berks County, Pennsylvania.  This emergency response plan has been developed in accordance with the provisions of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1968/Title III and the Local Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning District of Berks County.\n\nRAWA's Maidencreek Filtration Plant was constructed in 1934 as a municipal water purification plant for the City of Reading and surrounding communities.  Raw water is conveyed from Lake Ontelaunee to the filtration plant via a 7 foot diameter concrete conduit.  Once the raw water enters the head of the plant, it is put through various phases of treatment, including screening, coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection prior to being pumped into a distribution system. \n\nChlorine and aqueous ammonia (24%) are used in combination to form chloramines which are used to disinfect the finished/filtered water.  Chlorine, an EPA-regulated substance, is stored on-site in amounts that exceed the regulatory threshold of 2,500 pounds.\n\nThe filtration plant has a separate chlorination room that contains chlorine scales, chlorine feed lines, a chlorine evaporator and various safety equipment.  The chlorine feeders are located in an adjacent isoloated room with access only from the outside.  The room is provided with positive floor level ventilation.  Various monitoring instruments and a computer system are located in the main control building along with additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine on-line at any given time is two one-ton cylinders.  The facility operates 24 hours per day and is always manned by at least two licensed water treatment plant operators.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorin"

The cylinders are stored in an outdoor, three-walled, covered enclosure and are moved in to the chlorine room via an overhead trolley/hoist assembly as needed.  In addition, twenty-five 150-lb cylinders are typically delivered to the facility for distribution to RAWA's four remote chlorine stations located in the distribution to RAWA's four remote chlorine stations located in the distribution system.  \n\nThe general RAWA emergency response program is based on the following key elements:\n(1)  High level of training of the operators\n(2)  Preventice maintenance program \n(3)  Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n(4)  Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n(5)  Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), which are worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply and the availability of chlorine detectors.  Two half face masks with ammonia canisters are also available to the operators whom are trained in the awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of both chlorine and aqueous ammonia and the proper PPE to be used.\n\nFrom a review of existing records and plant data, it appears that no accidental releases of chlorine gas have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated and approved by the Berks County Emergency Management Agency, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) of Berks County.  This program includes planning and prevention procedures, hazard analysis, internal response capabilities, resources, plan development, and maintenance activities and notification requirements.\n\nThe most recent Hazard Review for this facilit"
