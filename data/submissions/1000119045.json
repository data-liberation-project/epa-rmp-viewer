This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we have trained staff in emergency response and are coordinated with the Anchorage Middletown Fire Department and the Metro Louisville LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility primarily produces frozen bakery products (e.g., pancakes & biscuits).  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-looped ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nDue to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration onsite, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability (>10,000 lbs.), this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3.
