Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Air Products Polymers, L.P., facility in Langley, South Carolina contains a RMP covered process, which is an acrylic polymer emulsions manufacturing process.  The facility must maintain greater than 10,000 pounds of acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate monomer and 28% aqua ammonia to safely and efficiently manufacture acrylic polymer emulsions. There are currently no RMP flammable materials above the action threshold. \n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations as well as our own environmental, health, and safety standards.  Air Products manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing our operations. Our accident prevention program is based on OSHAs Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.\n\nAir Products is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  Air Products is a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association and subscribes to the Responsible Care Program.  The Langley facility is actively involved with local organizations concerned with the safety of our community and the environment such as the Aiken County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Aiken County HAZMAT and the Air Products, Langley Plant, Community Advisory Panel.\n\n2.  The facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Air Products Polymers, L.P. acrylic polymer emulsions manufacturing facility is located at 403 Carline Road, Langley, South Carolina.  To produce acrylic polymer emulsions, acrylate monomers and acrylonitrile liquids are polymerized in reactors to form acrylic polymer emulsions.  The acrylic emulsion is a non-hazardous, water based liquid.  The product is then"

Approximately 40,000 pounds of acrylonitrile, 120,000 pounds of liquid vinyl acetate monomer, and 75,000 pounds of 28% aqua ammonia is present on site in the storage tanks, piping and processing.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):\n\nThe worst case release scenario for an RMP listed toxic liquid at the Langley, SC facility, as defined by the EPA, involves the release of acrylonitrile from the failure of an acrylonitrile tank truck while unloading. The spill pool from a bulk tank truck failure is larger than that from the failure of our bulk storage tank; this event would have off-site impact.  The EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide was used to determine what off-site impact would result in the event of this release, which would be approximately 20,000 pounds.  The worst case release scenario is highly unlikely due to several factors which include regular mechanical integrity inspections of the tank and associated hardware, operator presence in the field to watch for leaks or spills while unloading the material, and passive mitigation, which limits the vaporization of the release.\n\nThe alternate case scenario for acrylonitrile at our facility is the failure of a hose while unloading acrylonitrile to a storage vessel in the manufacturing facility.  This scenario could result in the release of 5,400 pounds of acrylonitrile.  Although there have been no instances of a release of this magnitude at the Langley site, we have experienced small leaks around hose flanges which indicate that this scenario might be possible and would be reasonable for emergency planning purposes.  This release has been estimated to barely reach off-site of our facility.\n \n4.
