This is a structured approach to managing the safety, health, and environmental risks, which are inherent in our business.  While OIMS was not designed to meet a specific regulation, each section of the Process Safety Management (PSM)/Risk Management Program (RMP) standard can be mapped directly to an OIMS system.  The OIMS system is the overall guidance, while specific operating, mechanical, technical and / or SHE procedures support the system by providing more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     BRPP was constructed in 1968 and manufactures low-density polyethylene (LDPE) via a high-pressure process using six production lines (A-F-Lines).  Products produced from the LDPE include plastic films, molding, adhesives, compounding and oil additives.  An additional line (G-Line) was built in 2004 which produces ethylene-propylene rubber.  Ethylene, propylene, and vinyl acetate are received by pipeline while other raw materials are received by truck or railcar.  BRPP has several small storage tanks for raw materials.  All power is generated offsite and supplied through ENTERGY.  Four small package boilers provide for the site steam needs.  Two flares are used to control continuous and intermittent vent streams from the units.  The site utilizes three cooling towers and refrigeration units to supply cooling/chilled water throughout the site.  BRPP's Purge Gas Purification Unit is used to recycle ethylene from offgases of the units.\n\n\n\n     BRPP uses seven regulated substances above threshold quantity in six separate processes.  These substances are acetaldehyde, n-butane, 1-butene, ethylene, propane, propylene, and vinyl acetate.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCI"

Assurance of operations integrity requires management leadership and commitment visible to the organization and accountability at all levels. Operations Integrity addresses all aspects of operations that can impact safety, security, health and environmental performance (SSH&E).\n\n-- OIMS 5.1 - Personnel Safety:  This system is in place to ensure that safety is a core value and will be considered in every decision that is made.  No business objective is so important that it will be pursued at the sacrifice of safety.  Each employee has a personal responsibility for our safety and the safety of others. Accidents, injuries, and occupational illnesses are preventable through the application of effective systems, procedures, and practices to ensure the safety of personnel.\n\n\n\nPSM/RMP Element - Process Safety Information [29 CFR 1910.119(d), 40 CFR 68.65]\n\n-- OIMS 2.1 - Risk Analysis, Assessment, and Management:  This system is in place to ensure that risk assessments reduce risks to safety, security, health and the environment and mitigate the consequences of incidents by providing essential information for decision-making.  This process involves hazard identification, assessment of probabilities and consequences, and evaluation of risk prevention and mitigation measures.

      "SummaryText": "SAFETY\n\n     As previously discussed, OIMS 11.1 (Assessment and Improvement) is in place to improve Operations Integrity by measuring performance relative to requirements.  Since OIMS supports PSM / RMP elements as discussed above, the assessment and improvement process under OIMS 11.1, by definition, improves overall process safety at the site.  This is accomplished through a process of internal and external OIMS assessments and follow-up.  Internal assessments are conducted annually utilizing personnel trained in the expectations OIMS.  External assessments are conducted periodically by personnel from outside the affected operation.  Team composition and frequency are consistent with the complexity of operations, regulations, and performance history.\n\n"
