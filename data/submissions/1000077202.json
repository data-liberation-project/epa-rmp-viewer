This is a structured approach to managing the safety, health, and environmental risks, which are inherent in our business.  While OIMS was not designed to meet a specific regulation, each section of the Process Safety Management (PSM)/Risk Management Program (RMP) standard can be mapped directly to an OIMS system.  The OIMS system is the overall guidance, while specific operating, mechanical, technical and / or SHE procedures support the system by providing more detailed information.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n     BRPP was constructed in 1968 and manufactures low-density polyethylene (LDPE) via a high-pressure process using six production lines (A-F-Lines).  Products produced from the LDPE include plastic films, molding, adhesives, compounding and oil additives.  An additional line (G-Line) was built in 2004 which produces ethylene-propylene rubber.  Ethylene, propylene, and vinyl acetate are received by pipeline while other raw materials are received by truck or railcar.  BRPP has several small storage tanks for raw materials.  All power is generated offsite and supplied through ENTERGY.  Four small package boilers provide for the site steam needs.  Two flares are used to control continuous and intermittent vent streams from the units.  The site utilizes three cooling towers and refrigeration units to supply cooling/chilled water throughout the site.  BRPP's Purge Gas Purification Unit is used to recycle ethylene from offgases of the units.\r\n\r\n     BRPP uses seven regulated substances above threshold quantity in six separate processes.  These substances are acetaldehyde, n-butane, 1-butene, ethylene, propane, propylene, and vinyl acetate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCI"
