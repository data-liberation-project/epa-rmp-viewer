If, despite our best \r\nattempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, \r\ncontrol, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Incident Response Plan.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program \r\n(RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on \r\nJune 20, 1996, and last revised on April 9, 2004.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Gillis Gas Plant, located in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, is owned and operated by Targa \r\nResources, Inc.  The Gillis Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant that receives raw natural \r\ngas and natural gas liquid streams by pipeline.  The site consists of inlet gas separation, \r\ndehydration, cryogenic gas processing (recovery of natural gas liquids), fractionation, product \r\nstorage and loading equipment.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline and truck.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), \r\nthe Gillis Gas Plant's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated \r\nflammable or toxic substances were on the plant site in quantities above the threshold quantities.  \r\n[Note:  The term threshold quantity is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the \r\nsubstance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that"
