(the Facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the Facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. It is stored in three (3) steel containers: two (2) of 8,000 gallons each and one (1) of 12,000 gallons. The maximum quantity stored would be 121,400 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:  A. The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of ten (10) minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, the contents of the largest storage tank (12,000 gallons), which represents the volume of that tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.8 miles. B. The Alternate Case Scenario, based on the 5-year accident history or the most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes until an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 26,600 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The Facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (O"

The standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), K-61.1, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", has been adopted by reference in Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200). The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form, Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the Facility, nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the Facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or use of anydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
