The Wallula mill handles one or more regulated substances listed in Appendix A of Part 68.\r\n \r\n2.0\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\r\n\r\nBoise owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located in Wallula Washington, which is an existing major stationary source per the requirements of Title V Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The regulated substance handled by this facility is chlorine dioxide, which is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\r\n\r\nThe Wallula mill uses Kraft and neutral sulfite semi-chemical (NSSC) pulping processes to produce pulp and paper from wood chips. Chlorine Dioxide is regulated under the Risk Management Program, and used at the mill to bleach the Kraft pulp.  Paper, the final product of the mill, is made from both bleached and unbleached pulp.\r\n\r\nChlorine Dioxide is generated at the mill using the R-8 generation process. Chlorine Dioxide is stored in an aqueous solution in two 272,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum amount of chlorine dioxide that is stored in the tanks is 52,220 pounds.\r\n\r\nBoise Cascade also stores the following listed chemicals on-site, in quantities below the RMP thresholds for each process: aqueous ammonia, propane, hydrochloric acid, acetylene, and chlorine for process water treatment.\r\n\r\n3.0\tAccidental Release Prevention\r\n\r\nBoise takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Wallula mill\u00bfs management systems, which cover the chlorine dioxide process, address each of the following key features of successful prevention programs.\r\n\r\n\t1.\tRMP"

This information was compiled from numerous sources for easy access by a reader seeking data on these substances.\r\n\r\nProcess safety information was carefully assembled for the chlorine dioxide processes. Process specifications on each process are collected in one area for easy reference.  Detailed specifications on such items as maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, and codes and standards used to design, build and operate the processes are on file at the mill.\r\n\r\n\t3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nA hazard analysis was conducted for each of the covered processes.  The hazard analysis team was made up of representatives from plant management, maintenance experts, process and project engineers, and process operating personnel.  The hazard review utilized the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) approach, which was supplemented by the completion of design checklists.\r\n\r\n\t4.\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nA rigorous detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) program has been developed, and is stringently review"

The Wallula training program for the covered processes includes both initial and refresher training courses, a general overview of the process, the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and a thorough review of the standard process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are given to ascertain if the employee understands the materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t6.\tMechanical Integrity Program\r\n\r\nAn experienced and well-trained maintenance staff maintain the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize and prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, and/or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program covers inspections and testing to identify equipment deterioration or damage before equipment failure.  The elements of this program include:\r\na)\tSpecifications for inspection and testing of process equipment.\r\nb)\tSpecifications for replacement parts and equipment.\r\nc)\tProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment.\r\nd)\tProcedures for safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, hot work permits and confined space entry.\r\ne)\tMaintenance personnel training procedures\r\nf)\tDocumentation of maintenance activities\r\n\r\n\r\n\t7.\tManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Wallula mill\u00bfs management of change program requires approval by the management team for all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for the chlorine dioxide process to ensure that the change does not affect safe operations.

Boise assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.
