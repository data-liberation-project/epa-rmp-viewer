      "SummaryText": "This is a faclity in a town of 225 people.  The accidental release prevention that we have in place are relief valves and automatic shut-offs if a certain quantity is released.The regulated substance that we have is anhydrous ammonia. The worst case scenario is if one of the anhydrous ammonia bulk tanks release 76,320 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia. The alternative release scenario is if a transfer hose leaks.  This release wouldn't be very large due to the safety valves we have  in place on the bulk anhydrouse ammonia tank.  The facility has no 5 year accident history. There has been no acccidents involving anhydrous ammonia in the last 5+ years. The 2 employees are on the local volunteer fire department. Our safety procedures have been to give the employees a hands-on walk throught of the anhydrous ammonia facility pointing  out proper prodedures and safety items. These informal safety sessions have been documented.  Due to the RMP program, we have a policy to documentall safety procedure reviews and meetings. The emergency response plans include shutting off the manual valves and contacting the fire department, if needed."
