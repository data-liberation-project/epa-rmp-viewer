This facility is subject to U.S. EPA regulations governing Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Section 112\u00ae of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G. The RMP report certifies that Colorite Specialty Resins has instituted a Risk Management Program at the Burlington Facility that is in compliance with U.S. EPA ARP requirements. \n\nThe RMP includes an Executive Summary and Data Elements following the format published by U.S. EPA.  In addition to identifying the applicable corporate policies and risk management systems, this RMP identifies a set of worst case and alternative release scenarios, the potential off-site consequences of those releases, and the facility's five-year accidental release history.  (This facility has had no accidental release events that would require reporting under these new federal rules).  This RMP also certifies that prevention and emergency response programs are in place so as to minimize risks to both workers and the potentially affected public.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of Colorite Specialty Resins management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material; but if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to facility employees, the public and the environment.\n\nThis objective is being accomplished by utilizing good operating practices and procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.

      "SummaryText": "ite's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.  Further, the Colorite Burlington Facility recognizes that it has a duty to protect its employees and neighbors from the effects of all dangerous chemicals.  \n\nColorite Specialty Resins has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the ARP Program, which is coordinated with its already-established OSHA Process Safety Management and plant emergency response programs.  At the Colorite's Burlington Facility, the Plant General Manager has primary responsibility for ensuring overall implementation and compliance with these programs. Other individual employees such as the Technical Director, Safety and Training Manager are responsible for the Technical implementation of individual sections of these programs.\n\nFacility Description\n\n\nThis facility is a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing facility in the Colorite Specialty Resins Division of Tekni-Plex.  The facility began operation in 1962 as Cary Chemical.  Tenneco acquired it in 1966 and by OxyChem in 1986.  In 1995 Colorite Specialty Resins (Pure Tec Inc., parent company), bought the facility.  In 1998 Tekni-Plex took ownership through a merger.   In its manufacturing of plastics and resins Colorite utilizes two chemicals which are subject the U.S. EPA 's RMP Rules, and, by extension, to the TCPA Rules of the NJDEP.  These are vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and vinyl acetate monomer (VAM).\n\nThe plant is located at 35 Beverly Road in the township and county of Burlington.  Of the total plant property of 139 acres, approximately 40 acres are used for industrial activities and are fenced.  The Delaware River is north of the facility.  Public Service Electric property is north and east of the facility.  Residential area is to the east, south and west, with the closest residents about 500 feet north and 1,000 feet south.  The distance to the closest industrial neighbor property fenceline is approximately"

      "SummaryText": "1000 feet to the west of the single VAM storage tank, and about 140 ft from the western-most VCM storage tank. \nThere are 125 site personnel at Colorite.  Production operations are conducted on a seven-day week, 24-hour day basis. Plant security is provided by a 24-hour contract guard service.   The site has supporting offices, laboratory, maintenance, warehouse and utilities.\n\nPVC resins are manufactured by two interconnected process systems.  They both rely on the same permanent connections to the storage facilities that contain the raw materials for both of the processes.  In addition, supplemental storage of VCM is provided by several railcars occupy a spur located on the northern side of Colorite's property.  Therefore for the purposes of the RMP program, Colorite considers the entire storage area and each of the main manufacturing systems as subparts of the same overall PVC manufacturing process.  Operations subject to the EPA RMP Rule include the storage of raw materials, weighing tanks, process reactors, batch mixing tanks, VCM stripping and recovery from PVC.\nManufacturing PVC involves both the dispersion process (rated capacity 50 mm #/yr.) and the suspension process (rated capacity 70 mm #/yr.).  The dispersion process uses licensed Wacker technology in fourteen 3,000 to 3,800 gallon column reactors.  The suspension process uses eight 5,000-gallon tank reactors.  The primary raw material, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), is received in railcars and subsequently unloaded into four 80,000-gallon 'bullet' tanks for storage.  The co-polymerizing material is exclusively vinyl acetate monomer (VAM), which is received by truck and stored in one 30,000-gallon vertical fixed-roof tank.  Both raw materials contain traces of inhibitor to prevent premature polymerization.  Product resin is shipped by bulk in railcars and trucks and in bags.\nProgram Level Identification\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as programs."

Program 1 is applicable to any process for which it can be demonstrated that the public would not be adversely affected by a release. Thus, to qualify for Program 1, a facility with a regulated toxic chemical needs to meet two criteria.  \n* no release over the most recent 5-year period has resulted in off-site injury or environmental damage; and \n* Dispersion modeling demonstrates that a worst-case release (as defined by the regulation) will not result in concentrations at public receptors that exceed the toxic or thermal or overpressure endpoints specified by the U.S. EPA.\n\nThe Colorite Plant has not had an accident or release involving either of its regulated substances, vinyl chloride monomer, or vinyl acetate monomer, over the last 5 years. However, modeling calculations of the possible consequences of the worst-case release, as defined by the regulation, predict the possibility of thermal effects of VCM or airborne concentrations of VAM at public receptors that could exceed the toxic endpoint identified in the rule. Therefore, neither of these two materials is eligible for Program 1.\n\nProgram 2 and 3 are applicable to processes that do not qualify for Program 1. Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3. Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those for VCM at Colorite, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). Much of the basic foundation of the Colorite Accident Prevention Program is adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard for VCM.  These OSHA requirements are directly consistent with the Program Level 3 RMP Program requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.

Therefore, VAM is now classified as qualifying at the Program 3 level under 40 CFR part 68, and the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan related to VAM are being addressed in a manner that is consistent with this classification.  That is, this RMP has been updated to describe both chemicals as elements of the same overall process, even though they are thought of as individual processes on the operational level.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Colorite facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\nThe VCM portion of the storage suspension and dispersion processes are subject to the Risk Management Regulation as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.

Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are thoroughly documented so that information about the safe handling of chemicals present at the facility is available to all employees, and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Incident Commander. This is especially important when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community. \n\nColorite\u00bfs safety program incorporates continuous improvement through use of audits, inspections, and on-going evaluations of in-plant safety and program effectiveness. The information gathered is evaluated and improvements that are identified are incorporated into the program. All of these features of the RMP and the PSM program at the Colorite Plant lead to operations that are safe today, but will be even safer tomorrow."
