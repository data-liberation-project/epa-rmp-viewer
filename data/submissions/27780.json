This facility conforms to the laws and regulations of the state of Missouri.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a capacity of 18,000 gallons water capacity.  One storage tank, rail car risers, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility operates with normal business hours during the spring and fall season.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank releasing the entire 160,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The off site consequences were calculated using TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers/DEGADIS.  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an F atmospheric stability class.  A urban topography was selected as typical.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e distance to the endpoint was 1.22 miles. It is estimated that 310 people would be affected by this release.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a hose breaks and leaks 7,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a D atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using urbanl topography and TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers/DEGADIS  the toxic endpoint is ..46 mile.  The population with in that area is estimated to be 140 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.  \n\nRay-Carroll County Grain Growers, Inc. has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years.  Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nRay-Carroll County Grain Growers, Inc. has several key elements their accident prevention plan:\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Missouri.\n2. Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5. Annual inspections include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n6. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
