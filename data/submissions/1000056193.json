Enel believes that no monetary value can be placed above a human life and therefore will provide procedures for the primary purpose of preserving life and secondly to preserve its assets at this location. \r\n\r\nEnel expects its employees to respond only to incidental releases of hazardous substances and not to major, uncontrollable releases where employees are expected to immediately evacuate the site. Therefore, an Emergency Action Plan, which is an element of the Emergency Response Plan, has been developed to detail the evacuation procedures. \r\n\r\nThe Salt Wells Geothermal Power Plant is a binary geothermal power generation facility built entirely on Bureau of Land Management leases within the Salt Wells Known Geothermal Resources Area. (KGRA). The project is a binary design utilizing two closed loop systems that exchange heat energy. The first loop is geothermal fluid that is pumped from production wells to the plant. The hot geothermal brine passes through a heat exchanger where a portion of its heat energy is given up and then flows to injection wells where it is returned to the underground resource. The second loop is the working fluid, in this case isobutane, which is pumped from the accumulator vessel, as a liquid, to the heat exchangers where heat from the geothermal fluid vaporizes the isobutane to a superheated vapor. In the vapor state it passes through a turbine which in turn drives a generator that produces electrical energy. Having passed through the turbine, the vapor, at reduced temperature and pressure, flows through air cooled condensers where additional heat is removed resulting in isobutane returning to a liquid state. The liquid isobutane gravity drains back to the accu"

During normal operation the isobutane and geothermal fluid are never in direct contact and there are no losses to the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nEnel complies with all requirements of Nevada's Department of Environmental Protection Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP). Additionally the CAPP program contains all of the elements of OSHA's PSM Standard 29 CFR, Part 1910.199(c) and EPA RMP Standard 40 CFR, Part 68.83. Program elements of CAPP are administered by Enel's HSEQ Specialist with the site Operations Manager being responsible for the day to day implementation. Employee's are aware of, have access to and are included in the development and implementation of all of the following program elements: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Pre Startup Safety Review, Incident Investigation, Emergency Action/Response Plan, Contractor Safety Training, Preventative Maintenance/Mechanical Integrity, Employee Participation and Verification of Compliance Audit programs."
