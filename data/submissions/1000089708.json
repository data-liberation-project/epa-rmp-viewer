Note that the RMP definition of a potential worst-case scenario results in a scenario that is not generally considered credible.  The alternative release scenarios represent more credible events; however, they are not as likely to occur with ChampionX mitigation measures implemented.  ChampionX's RMP does include both worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the toxic chemicals present on the site.\n\n\n\n1.4    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nChampionX maintains several programs to help prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals and to ensure safe operations.   The accident prevention programs in place at the facility include the following:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nChampionX has a program in place to ensure that information is available regarding the hazards of the regulated chemicals, the processes that handle these chemicals, and the equipment in the process.  This information is used to identify and understand hazards posed by these chemicals and processes. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nUnder ChampionX procedure for process hazard analyses (PHA), ChampionX performs detailed PHAs to identify hazards, to assess the likelihood of those hazards (including accidental releases), and to evaluate the consequence of these hazards.  Analyses are performed on both new and existing processes.  PHAs for regulated chemical storage include a review of material unloading, storage, and transfer operations. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nChampionX has developed written procedures for the operation of all ChampionX processes.  These procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activiti"

ChampionX also has written procedures for safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening of process piping (line-opening), and control over the entrance into the plant by support personnel. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEvery employee involved in operating a covered process is trained in the written operating procedures.  The training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operating procedures, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nChampionX has an extensive mechanical integrity program with written procedures to help ensure that process equipment is inspected and maintained.  Employees with mechanical integrity responsibilities are trained to ensure that they can safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nChampionX has a written Management of Change program to ensure that changes to a covered process are adequately reviewed for identification of safety, health and environmental issues before they are implemented. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nLike the Management of Change procedures, ChampionX has a written procedure for the review of new or modified equipment before that equipment is started up. The review is conducted to confirm that the equipment is properly designed and installed and that the associated procedures are in place and are adequate.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWhen an incident or near-miss occurs, ChampionX has a written procedure for reporting incidents and investigating them appropriately.  The purpose of these investigations is to determine the root cause of the incident or near-miss and to identify corrective actions, which can help prevent a recurrence of that event.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nChampionX has a written procedure and permit for hot work operations conducted on or near "

      "SummaryText": "nt History\n\nIn the last 5 years, the facility has experienced one accidental release as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.42 that met the criteria to be defined as an RMP-covered accident. The accidental release met the 40 CFR Part 68.42 definition because it resulted in injury to personnel as detailed in Table 2 (see Section 6.0, Five-Year Accident History in the table).\n\n \n\nThe RMP-covered incident occurred on 27th August 2016 when an operator was transferring Tri-ACTTM  1820 (containing 30wt% cyclohexylamine) from a storage tank to a micro-container. The flow meter that was normally used to package micro-containers from the storage tank was not functional, so the operator chose to use the nearby tank truck scale.  The operator began filling the first micro-container using a 2 inch drum-out hose. The first micro-container was missing product, so the operator leaned over the micro-container to see the liquid level around the hose.  The operator opened the valve on the charge lance and material splashed from the micro-container onto the operator's face and neck.  The operator was then transported to the hospital for treatment of burns. \n\n    \n\n1.7    Emergency Response Program\n\nChampionX maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  ChampionX's program provides the essential planning and training for more effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, ChampionX coordinates its plan with the community emergency response plan. \n\n    \n\nChampionX has an on-site emergency response team.  Team members are trained and properly equipped to respond to a variety of emergency situations, including fires and chemical releases.  ChampionX also coordinates emergency response with the local police/fire departments, Local Emergency Planning Commissions (LEPC), and other county emergency responders.  ChampionX's emergency respo"
