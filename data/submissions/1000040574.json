Main operations at the Hillshire Brands - Zeeland Facility include processing/packaging of turkey, chicken, beef, and pork products. In addition to processing meats, the Hillshire Brands - Zeeland Facility operates an automated breakfast bowls assembly and packaging line. Hillshire Brands has been in operation at this location since 1936 providing quality meat products and over 850 jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. It is Hillshire Brands' policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products. Hillshire Brands also operates freezers and coolers for product storage. Hillshire Brands uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 575,000 sq.ft. facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers. Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing"

Hillshire Brands' refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping.  \n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Hillshire Brands has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel over a 10-minute period.  Based on Hillshire Brands' refrigeration system, the worst-case release scenario is the rupture of one of the receivers (6,900-gallon vessel) when filled to 80% capacity.  Using EPA's RMP*Comp, it was determined that the ammonia release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public / environmental receptors. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered by Hillshire Brands to be a likely release scenario for the facility. During normal operations, Hillshire Brands maintains the receivers at no more than 60% capacity. Only during pump-down operations do the receivers have the potential to be filled to 80% of capacity. The receivers are operated in pump-down mode less than 1% of the time during the year.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Hillshire Brands taking into consideration the 5-year history of operation's experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses conducted to ensure that Hillshire Brands' hazards are identified and minimized. These analyses were conducted in accordance to Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119). In accordance with 40 CFR 68.28, alternative release scenarios were considered, that would be more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenarios.  \n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the process hazard ana"

In developing the release parameters of this alternative scenario, Hillshire Brands considered the area of highest Hi-Lo traffic, rupture of the largest pipe connected to the evaporator, the average response time of the facility's Hazmat team, and the mitigation provided by the building structure.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Hillshire Brands has implemented certain precautionary measures, including process / equipment controls, procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and auditing.  In addition, Hillshire Brands' ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted industry standards and good engineering practices. \n\n\n\nHillshire Brands has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Hillshire Brands has trained approximately 45 team members to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat team).\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed periodically by the operators during PSM training sessions.  Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed during these meetings "

Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Hillshire Brands, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Hillshire Brands has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using a computer maintenance management software system to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components, regular inspections and testing is conducted.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that Hillshire Brands' control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\n\n\n?    In accordance with the PSM program, Hillshire Brands conducts detailed PSM compliance audits at least every three years that incorporate review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\n    \n\n?

Included in the SOP are measures to be taken internally by Hillshire Brands as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n\n    \n\n    Hillshire Brands has trained approximately 45 on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.

The simulations are conducted with the entire emergency response system and involves coordination between Hillshire Brands' Hazmat team and offsite local fire, ambulance and police departments; as well as two local hospitals (with Air-Med units).
