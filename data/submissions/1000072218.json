All included information was reviewed and approved by Cardinal management prior to submittal of this RMP.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nCardinal is committed to worker and public safety and has invested significant resources to prevent accidents.  These resources include personnel training as well as considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nIt is Cardinal's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responders, as necessary. The facility also maintains: a Health & Safety Plan and a Spill Prevention, Control & Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\n\n\nThe Cardinal ethanol plant is located in Union City, Randolph County, Indiana. The facility utilizes corn/milo to produce ethanol via natural fermentation to produce fuel grade ethanol for blending with gasoline and other motor fuels. Co-products produced as a result of ethanol manufacturing include Dried Distiller's Grains with Solubles (DDGS), corn oil and carbon dioxide. The substance regulated under the RMP program is Natural Gasoline (Flammable Mixture), also known as Denaturant. Denaturant (Natural Gasoline) is used at the facility for blending with ethanol to comply with Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulations to allow final sale of the product.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nAn OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been implemented for Denaturant at the Cardinal facility.\n\n\n\nThe Denaturant tanks are visually inspected daily. All associated equipment, including piping, connections, pumps and secondar"

      "SummaryText": "y containment structures are included in the inspection. Some of the checks performed during the daily inspection include: check for signs of leakage, corrosion, staining, and odor around all tank bases, valves, test ports, connections, flanges and manways. If an integrity issue is observed or a possible release is determined, it is immediately reported to the facility Supervisor and EH&S Manager.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nCardinal has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health & Safety Plan and an SPCC Plan.\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts employee training as part of facility activities. The importance of worker, public, and environmental safety is reflected in Cardinal's plans and training activities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe Cardinal facility has been designed and constructed to meet existing construction and process safety requirements. Cardinal will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety at the facility."
