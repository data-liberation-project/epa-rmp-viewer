INTRODUCTION\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan as it pertains to Cordova - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health, and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 80 percent, and releases to water 75 percent. \n\n\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cordova Fire Department and/or other emergency response organizations arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \n \n\n3.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE and THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nWe use two regulated substances at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance. \n\nThe following regulated substances are used at Cordova - 3M Company:\n               -Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), a non-flammable corrosive acid, which is a key raw material used to make such products as replacements f"

The look-up tables indicate the worst case scenario from Cordova - 3M Company is a release of hydrogen fluoride in a gaseous form over a ten minute period.   The worst-case scenario requirement for pentane is a complete release of the contents as a gas vapor cloud that ignites.\n\nTo evaluate the alternative case scenario Cordova - 3M Company used an air-modeling program called Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) for hydrogen fluoride.  The alternative release scenario for hydrogen fluoride is a release for 10 minutes in a gaseous form from a reactor.\n\nThe evaluation of the pentane alternative cas scenario Cordova - 3M Company used the look-up tables and equations provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The alternative release scenario for pentane is a release that creates a gas vapor cloud that ignites.\n\n5. PROGRAM TO  PREVENT ACCIDENTAL RELEASES\n\nAt Cordova - 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nWe have programs in place to address accidental releases as required by EPA, Process Safety Management requirements from OSHA, and all notification requirements of EPA's Emer"
