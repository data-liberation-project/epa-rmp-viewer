      "SummaryText": "The Facility maintains two separate ammonia refrigeration systems which contain a total of approximately 26,000 pounds of ammonia: 18, 500 pounds in the South System and 7,500 pounds in the North System.  The systems are closed loops, and little or no ammonia is needed annually to replenish minor losses due to routine maintenance or to sustain a milk and nut cooler, a -10 degree F freezer unit, plant process water coolers, and Facility air conditioners.\n\nThe receiver tanks for both systems are equipped with both sight glasses and pressure gauges. The pressure relief valve setting on the tanks is 250 psig, and the vent is to the roof with an appropriate diffuser. The mechanical rooms where the receivers are located are equipped with ammonia sensors set at 50 ppm. The sensors trigger an audio alarm throughout the Plant. The sensors are replaced annually. The sensors are calibrated every 30 days and the span is adjusted every 90 days.  At sounding the alarm, the system compressors are automatically shut down and the room exhaust fans are initiated. Ammonia within the room is exhausted to and through the roof. Shutdown allows the ammonia in the system to migrate to the cold spots within the system.  \n\nAlarm lights and/or sirens are located outside the north and south compressor rooms. At 30 parts per million (ppm) these alarms lights will activate to identify ammonia is present at or above 30 ppm. At 50 ppm, the general evacuation alarm sounds. Upon activation of the general evacuation alarm, employees are to evacuate through exits located on all sides of the production building. Personnel have  been instructed to move upwind of the Plant once outside.  \n\nBoth refrigeration systems are visually inspected daily by the operators. In addition to the ammonia sensors, there are either equipment electric panel lights or computer monitoring readings for temperature, pressure and/or liquid level on all pressurized elements of the systems. Vessels are equipped with pressure reli"

A fire hose can be affixed to the panel, and the ammonia charge can be dumped and mixed with water on discharge.  \n\nAn emergency action plan has been developed and has been coordinated with the Iola Fire Department. The Facility has an arrangement with the Iola Fire Department to provide response in emergencies.  The Fire Department has been made familiar with the Facility and the ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nThis system and its safeguards, along with Russell Stover employees' professional approach to prevent accidents with this and other chemicals used at their facility, has proven to be very effective at attaining a record of very few releases and minimal amounts of chemical lost during an emergency event. In the past five years, Russell Stover has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  It is the focus of Russell Stover to maintain that record and look into ways to improve the engineering, operations, and training of employees whenever possible."
