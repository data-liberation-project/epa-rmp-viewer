This document has been prepared in order to address\nthe following issues:\n\n     - Repeal of the State RMPP Program as delineated in HSC 25531-25543.3.\n     - Promulgation of the Federal RMP program per 40 CFR 68.\n     - Adoption of the Federal program requirements by the State of California.\n     - Acknowledge the facility change of ownership.\n     - Acknowledge the addition of processes at the facility which are subject to RMPP\n       requirements.\n\n     The RMP represents a revision of the previously required state document to incorporate\nthe federal requirements as outlined in 40 CFR 68. Federal RMP requirements give facilities until\nJune 21, 1999 to file the RMP, but the General Duty clause of the 40 CFR 68 regulations requires\nall facilities to properly:\n\n     - identify hazards\n     - design and maintain a safe facility\n     - prevent releases\n     - minimize consequences of releases.\n\n     The accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented risk\nmanagement and prevention program which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will\ntake to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. Ripon Cogeneration, Inc. (RCI) has chosen to\nprepare and implement its RMP in advance of the federal program due date in order to fulfill its\nobligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the\nsurrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\n\n     Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 the following summary is given:\n\n     \u0007    The RMP applies to the Ripon Cogeneration, Inc. facility located at\n          944 South Stockton St., Ripon, CA. 95366.\n\n     \u0007    The Ripon Cogeneration Facility is a gas turbine based cogeneration facility rated\n          at 49.9 Mw (nominal rating)."

      "SummaryText": "The facility consists of a LM5000 gas turbine, heat\n          recovery steam generator, and auxiliary boiler. The gas turbine is equipped with\n          a Selective Catalytic Reduction system for the control of Oxides of Nitrogen. The\n          SCR system utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the reactant in the catalyst. Ammonia\n          is stored in a stationary storage tank rated at 18000 gals., but state law and site\n          operating procedures limit the tank capacity to no more than 9000 gals.\n\n     \u0007    The facility utilizes five (5) ambient ammonia sensors and alarms in the tank area\n          as well as a single sensor for ammonia in the machinery room.\n     \n          Leak detection is confirmed by the cogen operator console and the water\nsuppression system is automatically initiated. The water suppression system is designed to mitigate\na major portion of any tank related release.\n\n     \u0007    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary\n          source are delineated in Sections 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.1.\n\n     \u0007    Worst Case release scenario is the failure or the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.\n          This scenario results in the release of approximately 55500 lbs. of ammonia. The\n          distance to the toxic endpoint is 5.0 miles and affects approximately 16000\n          individuals.\n     \n     \u0007    Alternative release scenario is the rupture of the main section of ammonia\n          distribution piping. This scenario results in the release of approximately 9257 lbs.\n          of ammonia. The distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 1.0 mile and\n          affects approximately 9300 individuals.\n\n     Piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic \n     valves which effectively limit the amount of any accidental release. System pressures are \n     monitored at the cogen console. The inlet air cooling portion of the ammonia system has \n     two monitors as well"

See section 2.3.\n          The Ripon Fire Department (RFD) will be the first responder in an ammonia\n          emergency. RCI personnel will perform \"awareness\" duties only, which simply\n          means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, RCI personnel will\n          make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. RFD\n          will handle leak containment. In the event of a major release, RCI will join forces\n          with RFD and State/County OES personnel in a \"unified command effort\" until the\n          emergency has been contained.\n\n     \u0007    The facility is constantly striving for improved performance and reliability from\n          all its   processes. As specific process and safety improvements are identified, they\n          will be evaluated by site and management staff for appropriateness and\n          implementation."
