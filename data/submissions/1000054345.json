This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of modified starches for industrial use. We have one regulated substance at our facility. This substance is Propylene Oxide [oxirane, methyl-]. Propylene Oxide is used for starch production substitution.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Propylene Oxide at our facility is 245,000lb. A railcar containing a maximum of 175,000 lb is staged into the facility when the Propylene Oxide tank is at or under 70,000 lb.\r\n\r\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nWe used EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, RMP Comp* and RMP Submit* to evaluate the Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios for Propylene Oxide. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nour facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 Standard, 1957 edition, applicable ANSI and ASME standards and per chemical supplier recommendations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION- Tate & Lyle, Houlton maintains a record of safety information that descrbes the chemica"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If Scenario\". The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA review for the Propylene Oxide system was performed in June 2009.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES- For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tate & Lyle, Houlton maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a maintenance shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTRAINING- Tate & Lyle, Houlton has acomprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as needed. \r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY-  Tate & Lyle, Houlton carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE- W"
