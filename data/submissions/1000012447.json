This RMP also includes \nall the elements of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by the Occupational Health \nand Safety Administration (OSHA).  The FCP facility which is owned by Fresno Cogeneration \nPartners, L.P., and operated by WSI Services, Inc. (WSI), is in the business of power \nproduction and uses anhydrous ammonia (Chemical Abstract Service [CAS] #7664-41-7) a \nregulated substance, and aqueous ammonia (CAS #1336-21-6) also a regulated substance.  This \nRMP document has been prepared in accordance with the California Accidental Release \nPrevention (CalARP) Program Guidance Document dated June 8, 2004 (California Code of \nRegulations [CCR], Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5).  The PSM section has been prepared \nin accordance with Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations Section 5189.  \n\nThe FCP plant processes and stores ammonia in quantities above the Federal and State \nregulatory threshold quantities and therefore, is submitting this RMP.  A Program 3 RMP is \nbeing submitted due to the proximity of the facility to off site receptors.\n\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWSI has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is used to respond to emergency situations.  \nThe plan consists of reporting and notification, mitigation, evacuation, emergency response \nassistance, and medical assistance procedures.  These procedures are discussed in detail in \nSection 7 of this report.\n\n1.2\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activity at the FCP facility is to generate electricity for sale.  The facility \nis located in a rural part of Fresno County and includes a 55 megawatt (MW) cogeneration \nunit (Cogeneration Unit) and a 2"

The Peaking Unit is driven by a 23 MW Pratt and Whitney FT4A9 gas turbine.  \nThe Cogeneration Unit is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to control \nemissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) by injecting anhydrous ammonia (NH3) into the exhaust gas \nstream upstream of a catalyst.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in a 12,000 gallon \naboveground pressure vessel.  The maximum operating capacity of the vessel is 9,984 liquid \ngallons (56,800 pounds) with a heel volume of 216 gallons and a vapor space of 1,800 gallons. \nFrom the vessel, ammonia vapor is injected into an air stream for injection into the SCR grid.\nThe Peaking Unit is in simple-cycle configuration exhausting through an oxidation catalyst \nand a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to control emissions of NOX by injecting a \n19% solution of aqueous ammonia (NH4OH).  The aqueous ammonia is stored onsite in a 7000 \ngallon aboveground vertical tank at atmospheric pressure. \n\n1.3\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWSI is dedicated to operating a safe facility.  WSI employees are trained in every aspect \nof hazardous materials management, from using personal protective equipment (PPE) to \nperforming maintenance on facility equipment.  All employees are trained in emergency \nevacuation procedures.  A written program for maintaining and inspecting the ongoing \nintegrity of all regulated substance process equipment ensures that equipment receives \nappropriate, regularly scheduled maintenance.  Regular inspections document and identify \nthe condition and reliability of each piece of equipment.  Maintenance on all tanks containing \nammonia is performed weekly (unless otherwise stated) and consists of visual inspection and \npreventive maintenance activities.  General tan"

Changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and \nprocedures will be implemented when necessary.  Before a process change occurs, management \nof change protocol will be implemented to ensure a safe and smooth transition.\n\nWSI performs a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for the ammonia tanks and for any modification \nsignificant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup \nsafety review shall confirm that, prior to the introduction of regulated substances, the \nprocess conforms to all specified regulations and safety requirements.\n\nWSI shall also report any events that may lead to impacts onsite or offsite, regardless of \nwhether or not an actual impact does occur, according to the incident investigation program \ncontained herein.\n\n1.4\tFive-year Accident History\n\nWSI has an excellent safety record.  There have not been any accidental releases of anhydrous \nammonia nor aqueous ammonia within the last five years that resulted in death, injury, or \nsignificant property damage on site, or known offsite death, injury, evacuation, sheltering \nin place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n1.5\tWorst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nCogeneration Unit\n\nFor the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, the worst-case release scenario assumes a rupture of \nthe tank, resulting in a constant release of the entire contents into the air for duration of \n10 minutes.  This scenario results in the toxic endpoint distance of 4.4 miles from the tank.  \nThe alternative release scenario, which is considered a plausible event, assumes a release of \nabout 200 gallons into the air for a duration of 1 minute.
