      "SummaryText": "1.0     Introduction\nSolvay Polymers, Inc. is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Solvay Polymers, Inc. has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Solvay Polymers, Inc. and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40CFR68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Solvay Polymers, Inc.  This plan is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP Rule (40CFR68.150 though 40CFR68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management plan at Solvay Polymers, Inc.\n\n2.0     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Repsonse Policies\nSolvay Polymers, Inc. is committed to  the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Solvay Polymers, Inc. implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, Solvay Polymers, Inc. emergency response actions are in place to help prevent or minimize injury to the public or the environment.\n\n3.0     Facility Process and Regulated Substances\nSolvay Polymers, Inc. manufactures polyethylene and polypropylene resins for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications such as milk bottles, carpet backing, and children's toys.  \nThe polyethylene manufacturing process uses ethylene as the basic building block for producing polyethylene.  Isobutane is used as a carrier solvent for the polyethylene process.  Likewise, propylene is used as the basic building block for the polypropylene pr"

Propane is inherent to both the polyethylene and polypropylene processes.  \n\n4.0      Offsite Consequence Analysis\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on the Solvay Polymers, Inc.  facility.  The subject analysis consisted of  Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario analyses. \nTwo Worst Case Scenarios were completed for flammable RMP compounds since each  Worst Case Scenario shows RMP impacts to different offsite receptors.  The first is a release of 330,000 pounds of isobutane from an isobutane storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The second is a release of 8,400 pounds of ethylene from the ethylene header, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Based on the RMP analysis, the  pressure effects  formed by the Worst Case Scenarios for these flammable compounds would reach offsite industrial endpoints but would not reach residential populations at the RMP endpoint.\nOne Worst Case Scenario was completed for toxic RMP compounds.  This scenario is an instantaneous release of 3,000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride liquid from a storage vessel, resulting in a toxic gas cloud.   Based on the RMP analysis, the resulting toxic cloud would reach offsite industrial endpoints but would not reach residential populations at the RMP endpoint concentration.\nWorst case weather conditions are considered (stable, low wind speed) for all Worst Case Scenarios.  In addition, the Worst Case Scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation actiivities.    No environmental receptors are within the RPM Worst Case Scenario impact areas.\nTwo Alternative Release Scenarios were completed for flammable RMP compounds since each Alternative Release Scenario shows RMP impacts to different offsite receptors.  The first is a BLEVE of a polyethylene reactor containing 58,000 pounds of isobutane.  The second flammable ARS is a release of 25,000 pounds of isobu"

This scenario is a release of 3,000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride liquid from a punctured storage vessel, resulting in a toxic gas cloud.   Based on the RMP analysis, the resulting toxic cloud would reach offsite industrial endpoints but would not reach residential populations at the RMP endpoint concentration.\nMost common weather conditions are considered for all Alternative Release Scenarios.  In addition, the Alternative Release Scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation actiivities.   No environmental receptors are within the RPM Altenative Release Scenario impact areas.\n \n 5.0    Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention steps\nThe polyethylene and polypropylene processes are currently covered by the PSM standard.  As such, a Program Level 3 prevention program is in place.  The following paragraphs describe the prevention program elements at Solvay Polymers, Inc.\n5.1    Safety Information -\nSolvay Polymers, Inc. maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the polyethylene and polypropylene processes.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of  all hazardous substances handled at Solvay Polymers, Inc.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n5.2    Hazard Review -\nSolvay Polymers, Inc. performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the our processes to help identify and control process hazards.
