Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Deardorff's Management of Change Procedure.  \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Deardorff has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Deardorff Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possible of a fire. \r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\r\n7. Verification of Deardorff's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Deardorff personnel.  Deardorff has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \r\n8.

The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.   The plan addresses training requirements for employees including general employees, supervisors, managers, and refrigeration employees.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \r\nUnder Deardorff's Emergency Response policy, Deardorff employees who have been trained as First Responders may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  Deardorff will evacuate affected area, begin notification process and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department and/or refrigeration contractor).\r\n\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety and to reduce the possibility of a release.\r\nKey recommendations identified during study included:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tDefine written PM Schedule, including fail test of safety components.\r\n\u00b7\tEstablish more written procedures, including safe work practices and maintenance procedures\r\n\u00b7\tRequest review and letter from project Structural Engineers to confirm seismic design of building and ammonia equipment supports/anchorage.

Deardorff has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Deardorff policies addressing the implementation of these regulations.  The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance and others.

Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Refrigeration System (System). This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system with equipment located inside and outside.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT \r\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design"

The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by Deardorff is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\r\nKey objectives of Deardorff Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\r\n2. Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Deardorff.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\r\n3. Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.) \r\n4. Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Deardorff certifies operators following completion of operator training and Deardorff's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training chapter.)\r\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).
