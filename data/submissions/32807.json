The County's proactive approach to implementing new policies for emergency management and accidental release prevention has been a keystone to their success over the years.  The gaseous chlorine system (Process) at the Dixie Park WWTP has not had an accidental release since the plant has been operated by the County in 1986.  The current prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Dixie Park WWTP is located in Hobe Sound, FL and utilizes chlorine gas process via vacuum injection for the disinfection wastewater.  The equipment in the Process is maintained per the maintenance procedures.  The gaseous chlorine is stored at the Process area in one-ton cylinders (2,000 pounds per cylinder).  The gaseous chlorine is liquefied under pressure when full.  The Process can have a maximum of 6 full cylinders on-site at one time.\n\n\n\nThe County and its employees have an impeccable performance history regarding the handling, storing, maintenance and operation of gaseous chlorine.  The Dixie Park WWTP is staffed by 4 full time employees.  The operational staff is state certified and is trained to safely handle, maintain, and operate the Process so that they comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The Process is designed by making use of the most recent technologies and Process specific design codes and standards.  The emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the community emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The operational staff has "

The County has continued to support this regulatory effort to inform the public in the general vicinity of the Dixie Park WWTP of the risks associated with accidental gaseous chlorine releases.  \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the information presented in this summary, please contact the offices of Martin County Utilities & Solid Waste Department, 2378 S.E.
