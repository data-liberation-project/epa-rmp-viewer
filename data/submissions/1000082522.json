Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules, regulations, and requirements.  Safety depends upon the manner which we handle these products combined with the safety devices, policies, and procedures and good engineering design and practices in the operation of the process.  These include proactive safety programs such as our behavioral based Basic Safety Process (BSP) and implementation of American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Codes of Management Practices during plant design.  \n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance:\n\n\n\nThe stationary source contains the following regulated substances above the EPA RMP TQ:  Arsine, Phosphorus Oxychloride, Titanium Tetrachloride, and Tetramethylsilane.  Arsine is manufactured under vacuum using a chemical reaction to generate the gas.  The aggregate storage of this product makes RMP applicable.  Phosphorus Oxychloride is purified using distillation technology.   The aggregate storage quantity of material makes this product RMP applicable.  Titanium Tetrachloride is purified using distillation technology.  The aggregate storage quantity makes this product RMP applicable.  Tetramethylsilane is received in an ISO module or tonner (tote size container) and then repackaged into smaller containers.  When an ISO module is on-site, the on-site storage quantity makes this product RMP applicable.\n\n\n\n3. This update is to lower the program level of Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4) from a Program Level 3 to a Program Level 2. This change in program level was identified during an annual audit. This change is required because PSM does not apply and NAICS 325120/325998 is not listed in the regulation.\n\n\n\n4. The general accident release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan and the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard "

In addition, the company has voluntarily invested in emission scrubbing technology that is not mandated by regulatory requirements or permits to operate.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nNo EPA reportable accidents have occurred at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\n \n\n6. The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a trained emergency response team in compliance with OSHA HAZWOPER.  There are emergency programs and plans specific to the facility and surrounding industry.  Local emergency responders have visited the facility and are familiar with site operations response capabilities. \n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nThe facility strives toward continuous improvement with regards to EH&S and good engineering practices and design.  In addition, the corporation has implemented EH&S Global standards and best management practices that often exceed regulatory standards.\n\n"
