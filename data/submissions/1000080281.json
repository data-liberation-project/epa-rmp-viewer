Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\n    The management and employees of Conserv FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of\n\n    any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,\n\n    the facility is prepared to work with the Kansasville Fire Department, Racine County Local Emergency \n\n    Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release                   \n\n    to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \n\n    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop\n\n    production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of two storage tanks, \n\n    nurse tanks, loading risers and associated plumbing.  Access to the site is                \n\n    restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized \n\n    contractors. \n\n\n\n3. The worst-case and alternate release scenario.\n\n\n\n   This facility has developed a worst-case and alternate-case scenario, however, since this is\n\n   security sensitive information it has been withheld from the Executive Summary as required by\n\n   EPA regulations. \n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n   This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable\n\n   state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the Compressed \n\n   Gas Association(CGA's)\"American National Standard Safety Requirements for The Storage and\n\n   Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"(6th edition),commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA-2.1 2014\n\n   as adopted by state regulation and standards provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and\n\n   Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  \n\n   Compliance with these regulations and on-going train"

Five year accident history.\n\n\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\n     -   have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n\n\n     -   to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in\n\n          place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n\n\n    The facility is a non-responding facility. The facility has:\n\n\n\n    -  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\n    -  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n\n          information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\n\n    - In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Kansasville\n\n      Fire Department and Racine County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n      Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to \n\n     assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for  \n\n     implementation at this time."
