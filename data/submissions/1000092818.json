The purpose of the Process Hazard Analysis and the methods to be used were discussed. \n\n\n\nMembers of the PHA Team were selected on the basis of those who might offer the most experience and resources to conduct accurate analyses of the covered process.  Specific job experience was considered when assembling the Team so that Management, Operations and Safety were adequately represented.  The PHA was conducted on March 8, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe Team used the records and documents listed in Section 5 of this document during the Process Hazard Analysis.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that there are potential accidents that will not be considered during the performance of PHA's based on the report; and even if the team's recommendations are followed, accidents may still occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
