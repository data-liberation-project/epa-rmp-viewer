This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our in-house First Responders are trained to take defensive action in correcting, minimizing and mitigating emergency situations. For emergency situations, we are also coordinated with the Orlando Fire Department which provides emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around fluid milk processing. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nOur facility houses two separate refrigeration processes that both utilize anhydrous ammonia. Although System 2 is not subject to the OSHA PSM Standard or 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA due to the system's inventory being below the threshold quantity, we have chosen to incorporate it into the PSM/ RMP program due to the safety programs for each being administered the same. \r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\r\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA RMP*COMP as well as the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prev"

Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source:\r\n\r\n - Process Safety Information\r\nT.G. Lee Dairy maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\r\n\r\n - Process Hazard Analysis\r\nThe methodology used to carry out the analysis is What If-Checklist.  The analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, T.G. Lee Dairy maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\r\n\r\n- Training\r\nT.G. Lee Dairy has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\nT.G. Lee Dairy carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified pers"

Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\n- Management of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at T.G. Lee Dairy to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\r\n\r\n- Pre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established process are conducted as a regular practice at T.G. Lee Dairy.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\nT.G. Lee Dairy conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\nT.G. Lee Dairy promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n- Employee Participation\r\nT.G. Lee Dairy truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  T.G. Lee Dairy has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nT.G. Lee Dairy has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nT.G. Lee Dairy has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes aspects of emergency response such as evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The Orlando Fire Department is the agency with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner."
