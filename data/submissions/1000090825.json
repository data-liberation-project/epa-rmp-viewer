(Symrise GmbH & Co., KG, MAA?hlenfeldstrasse 1,D-37603, Holzminden, Germany)  The Symrise, Bushy Park Site manufactures various forms of menthol, sunscreens, cooling agents, and fragrance specialties.  Symrise, Bushy Park was formerly a subsidiary of Bayer Corporation who established the Bushy Park site in 1970.  Haarmann & Reimer (now Symrise) was acquired by EQT Partners on October 1, 2002.  Prior to this date, H&R was included in the RMP considerations of Bayer Corporation who filed their RMP by the statutory deadline.  Bayer Corporation divested its Bushy Park holdings to Lanxess Corporation on 7/1/2004, who renamed the site to the Bushy Park Industrial Complex (BPIC) in 2006. Cooper River Partners (CRP) purchased the BPIC on November 13, 2009. \n\n\n\nSymrise is located within the BPIC 1650 acre site which is operated as an Industrial Park wherein Cooper River Partners currently own the land and the various tenants own and operate the assets on the land.  The site is on the Cooper River just a few miles east of Goose Creek, S C. Symrise has contracted with Cooper River Partners for the purchase of various services on site and with Lanxess Corporation for various materials.\n\n\n\nII.

Symrise has participated in disaster drills held by the LEPC.\n\n\n\nCompliance and Commitment to Safety\n\n\n\nProtection of our employees and neighbors is our highest priority, and that is why we have installed multiple safeguards to ensure that all chemicals are handled safely.  We also work closely with our suppliers, other companies, local officials and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks.  \n\n\n\nIn keeping with our commitment, Symrise has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\n\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  The Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \n\n\n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nFinal construction and startup has been completed on the new process subsequent to our initial RMP submission in November 2002. The new process is in compliance with PSM requirements for the Risk Management Program listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  The new process includes pentane storage and handling system.  Pentane is a liquid stored at ambient temperature and is regulated as a flammable material. \n\n\n\nSymrise uses pentane in the CHDD process area as a solvent in the manufacturing of a fragrance product.
