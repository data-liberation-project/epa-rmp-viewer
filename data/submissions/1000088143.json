The plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release and a release prevention and emergency response program.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nBurgmaier Fertilizer has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials. Emergency response procedures including evacuating procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Burgmaier Fertilizer. In addition, Burgmaier Fertilizer has developed operation procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThe Plan and emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety and emergency policies in place at Burgmaier Fertilizer.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nBurgmaier Fertilizer is located at 1720 Commerce Road in Creston, Iowa (the facility). Burgmaier Fertilizer is a farmer owned user of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure and aqueous ammonia. There are two anhydrous ammonia tanks located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 60,000 gallons. The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the two storage tanks into 1000 gallon tanks on their own running gears (nurse tanks). There are 4 sets of nurse tanks with 2 -1000 gallon tanks on each running gear.The contents of the tanks are used within Burgmaier Farms in the local community within their own farming operation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nBurgmaier Fertilizer has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Pro"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facilities existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and environment. The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nBurgmaier Fertilizer ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use. Burgmaier Fertilizer implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility. Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access and ammonia training for personnel.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\n(None) Recently Purchased (June 2020)\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Creston Fire Department regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release. The facility's  emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures. The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\r\n\r\n1: Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\r\n2: Information on emergency health care.\r\n3: Emergency response training for employees."
