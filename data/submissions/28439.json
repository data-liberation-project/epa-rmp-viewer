The RM plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia at Portion Pac. The facility Risk Management Plan provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the Portion Pac design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with the requirements.  In most instances, Portion Pac has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  \n\n1.1.    Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\nPortion Pac is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n1.1.1.    It is the policy of Portion Pac to:\n\n1.1.1.1    Provide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n1.1.1.2    Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.\n\n1.1.1.3    Provide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\n1.1.1.4    Ensure, through training, and when necessary disciplinary action, that all employees work in a safe manner.\n\n1.1.1.5    Educate and/or train all employees in safe work practices, and ensure that each employee fully understands his or her job, equipment, techniques, and methods to reduce the risk to himself or herself and their co-workers.\n\n1.1.2.    Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety\","

      "SummaryText": " so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n1.1.3.    This facilities aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials whereever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n1.1.4.    Portion Pac has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established regarding the ammonia process process.  It is the responsibility of designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5.    The first duty of Portion Pac employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2.    Facility Description Portion Pac is a dryblend, mixes, sauces and dressing processing facility where food ingredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, packaged and boxed for shipment to end users. A total of 209 employees work at the facility in a three shift schedule.  There is a minimum of 16 operators on duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n1.2.1.    The substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.2.2.    Anhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Process System\". Approximately 13,250 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  The ammonia is "

      "SummaryText": "contained in various vessels, cooling units, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the Process System.  The facility compressor room houses the compressors.  The high pressure receiver, glycol chillers and condensers are located in an area outside the building behind the maintenance department on the west side of the facility. \n\n1.3.    Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n1.3.1.    As required by EPA guidelines, the worst-case release scenario involves a failure within the process system, a vessel rupture that results in the total of 4,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia being released in a 10-minute period.  This release amount is based on the high pressure receivers normal operating level of 50%. Although the high pressure receiver is capable of holding a higher capacity of ammonia, this would exceed administrative procedures which limits the liquid level in the receiver to a maximum of 50% at any time. Considering the \"catastrophic\" possibility does exist for this vessel to release the entire contents, engineering controls incorporated into the system would normally prevent such a release. No mitigation systems were considered for this scenario due to the physical location of the receiver outside of the machine room. The  accidental release of the ammonia would vent into the open atmosphere.  Using ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) the distance to the endpoint for such a release is 1.3 miles.  There are potential public and environmental receptor impacts for this scenario.\n\n1.3.2.    The alternative release scenario involves the loss of anhydrous ammonia through a safety relief valve that is installed on one of the process system's vessels containing liquid ammonia. Such a release would be vented through the relief valve collection header located on the roof of the facility. The distance to the toxic endpoint for such a release, based on ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) is 0.25 miles.  There are no residential "

Alarms are placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n1.4.2.    Plant personnel have received emergency response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 and other various rules and regulations. \n\n1.4.3.    The Local Emergency Planning Committee and local Fire Department has visited the facility to review the process operations, safety systems and discuss emergency response coordination."
