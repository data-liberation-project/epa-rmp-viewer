      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n1. THE FACILITY POLICY:  The owners, management, and employees of Federated Co-op Transport are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equiptment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 226,007 pounds in the facility's 2 tanks.  The capacities of these tanks are 1-30,000 gallon tank and 1-18,000 gallon tank.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENERIO would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,200 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.6 miles.\n\nTHE ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO is assumed to be a release from rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose with 26,638 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.78 miles.\n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammmonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions,equiptment,containers and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistant with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  T"

      "SummaryText": "here have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site;  nor to our knowledge have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or enviromental damage.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III of EPRCA. Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response plan.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFTEY:  Saftey improvements is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia saftey recomendations for implementation at this time."
