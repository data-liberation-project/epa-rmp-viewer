Standard expansion valves act as the barrier between the high and low pressure parts of the refrigeration cycle. \n\nd) High Pressure Receivers\nThese receive and store ammonia in its liquid form.  These pressure rated vessels are designed, built, and inspected according to ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) standards.  The receivers have the capacity to temporarily store a majority of the ammonia used in the system.  Periodically, the receivers are used to store ammonia to allow maintenance or inspection of other system components.  After passing through the ammonia receivers, ammonia liquid flows to the expansion control valves for each chiller.\n\nE) Recirculators\nThese vessels, with ammonia pumps, supply liquid ammonia to the air handlers and receive the return suction for passage to the screw compressors.\n\nF)Oil Pot Draining\nOil pots on the large recirculators are used to collect any oil accumulation.  This excess oil is drained as part of the routine periodic maintenance of the system.\n\nG) Ammonia Charging\nAmmonia is charged into the system through a charging valve located on the receiver vessel.\n\nH) Air Handlers\nThese fan units operate in the cool rooms and freezer.  They are mounted near the ceiling and provide cooling by blowing air across cold, low pressure ammonia lines from the recirculators.\n\nI) Auto-Purger\nThis device separates air and non-condensable gases from the ammonia, dilutes them with water, and disposes of them\n\n2.  Detection, Monitoring, Automatic Control Systems, and Procedures\nExel, Inc. ammonia refrigeration facility is a state-of-the-art design with highly sophisticated monitoring and control capabilities.

These walkdowns are performed at least once every 24 hours.   \n\nBecause of the fully automatic nature of the system, the elaborate alarm system, and the limited need for operator involvement in the normal operation of an ammonia refrigeration system, there is no need for an operator to be present continuously in the ammonia refrigeration building.  For this reason, Exel, Inc.' standardized design for its ammonia refrigeration facilities includes a computer-based system that continuously monitors important system parameters and checks the status of the ammonia sensing system.  In the event that a critical process parameter deviates from normal range or a leak detector reaches an alarm setpoint, personnel at the remote monitoring location are alerted to take necessary corrective action.  The remote monitoring station for Stockton's refrigeration facility is installed in a central monitoring area in the Maintenance Department.  Security personnel can provide a secondary level of notification to contact appropriate Exel, Inc. individuals to respond to an incident.  \n \n\nExel, Inc. Preliminary Safety Review\n\nOnce the project scope has been defined, a Preliminary Safety Review is performed in order to obtain corporate approval.  The review may take several sessions.  The Preliminary Review examines the technical concept of the project, establishes the written process safety information that must be compiled, and assembles as much of this information as is available.

There also is a written emergency evacuation procedure and equipment lockout/tagout procedure. \nMechanisms are in place to ensure operating procedures, Piping and Instrumentation Drawings (P&IDs), and equipment, instrumentation and piping inspection lists are kept up to date. \nOperating personnel have trained in system startup, shut down, troubleshooting and emergencies. \nA control room walkdown has been performed to verify operating procedures are accessible to operators for reference. \nProvisions are in place to have supervisory personnel check on operators on a regular basis. \nDelivery of ammonia will be required to initially charge the addition to the refrigeration system.  Also, in the future, it will be necessary to recharge (replacing only a portion of the charge) the refrigeration system with ammonia, similar to the recharging of an automobile air conditioner.  It is estimated from past experience that the system may need to be done every 2-3 years. \nFor the initial charge, or when a recharge is necessary, ammonia will be delivered to the facility by a certified vendor using a bulk storage tank truck.

Maintenance Procedures and Schedules\nDuring operation, inspections and monitoring of critical system parameters are performed routinely.  Preventive maintenance procedures are carried out by maintenance staff and supervisors on a regular schedule to ensure that all components are in their best possible condition.  Any deviations from normal operating parameters are observed and corrected. \n\nExel, Inc.' maintenance programs for ammonia refrigeration facilities in use at its other sites have been adopted for the Stockton ammonia refrigeration.  These maintenance programs ensure that ammonia equipment is maintained in optimum working condition and that the facility is operated in a safe manner.

In addition to not having any ammonia accidents as defined by the California Health and Safety Code, there were also no releases of ammonia in the past three years which exceeded the 100 pounds/24 hour release repeatability threshold required by federal reporting guidelines (SARA Title lll).\n\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION (Anhydrous Ammonia System)\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the chemical used in the refrigeration system in this facility.  Refrigeration systems of this type are the most widely used in the world, primarily due to their reliability, safety and cost.  These systems are inherently safe and are designed and installed with automatic, computer-controlled monitoring systems to both indicate necessary maintenance procedures and sound the alarm in case of accident.  Ammonia is a lighter-than-air gas at atmospheric pressure and temperature and would rise quickly and disperse if released into the environment.  The primary hazard associated with ammonia is acute toxicity when inhaled or ingested. Ammonia also poses a hazard when coming into contact with the skin.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF AMMONIA REFRIGERATION\nRefrigeration is a general term used to describe the cooling of a space or substance to a temperature below the ambient temperature.  Mechanical refrigeration is an application of thermodynamics wherein a cooling medium, or refrigerant, goes through a sequence of phase changes, the net effect of which is to absorb heat from one location and transfer it to another.  This process occurs in a closed cycle so that the refrigerant is recycled.  In the Exel, Inc. facility at the Stockton site, ammonia is the refrigerant.  In the ammonia refrigeration cycle, liquid ammonia expands, absorbs heat from the surroundings, ammonia vapor is compressed, condensed to a liquid, and then expanded.  As it expands, ammonia liquid changes back to vapor and absorbs heat from its surroundings, thereby providing refrigeration.  After absorbing heat, the vapor is compressed ag"

Until the early 1980s, CFCs and HCFCs were the most commonly used refrigerants.  These substances, however, have been demonstrated to have ozone-depleting properties and high global warming potential, thus posing a long-term danger to the environment and possible health risks.  Substances such as propane, butane, ethane, and ethylene can also be used as refrigerants, but when mixed with air, these substances are highly flammable and explosive. Therefore, they pose a significant risk to workers and the community. \n\nAmmonia is one of several available refrigerants not in either of these problematic groups, and has been used in refrigeration applications for more than 100 years. \n\nMost larger industrial systems rely on ammonia as a refrigerant.  Ammonia was chosen as the at the Exel, Inc. Stockton site for many of the same reasons it has been selected by other manufacturers:\n\n     1. Ammonia is a highly efficient refrigerant.\n     2. Ammonia does not have any ozone depletion potential.\n     3. Ammonia does not have any global warming potential. \n     4. Although ammonia, like several other refrigerants, has toxic properties, it\n          has many advantages over other refrigerants in terms of worker and \n          community safety:\n \nAmmonia is easily detected by smell in concentrations well below levels that could be harmful. \nAmmonia gas is lighter than air and will rise and disperse into the atmosphere if released.  \nAmmonia has a high affinity for absorption in water.  This increases the effectiveness of emergency response actions.\n\nExel, Inc. has extensive operating experience with ammonia and a proven safety record.

The systems also meet the proposed revisions to the UMC and UFC.  These revisions to codes are supported by all the Northern and Southern Fire Prevention Officers (FPO) Code Committees of the California Fire Chiefs Association (CFCA).  All equipment, including piping, vessels, valves, instrumentation, and controls  are state-of the-art engineering design and construction.  The equipment is subject to inspections during construction and installation to ensure compliance with design and construction standards. \n\n Wherever possible, ammonia piping connections are of welded construction. Welded construction provides the strongest, most leak-proof type of piping connection.  Flanged and possibly screwed connections are used for specialty equipment that cannot be welded, such as system relief valves.\n\nThe equipment for the refrigeration system is located in one of three areas; the Engine Room, the facility cool rooms and freezer room, or mounted on the building roof-top.\n\na)Screw Compressors\nThese transform cold, low pressure ammonia gas into hot, high pressure gas.

The refrigeration process involves recirculation of ammonia and, other than periodic system monitoring, there is virtually no need for operator involvement in the normal operation of the system, thus reducing potential risk of human error. \n\nIn the unlikely event that a problem occurs that results in release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, a sophisticated ammonia detection system located throughout the ammonia refrigeration facility will sense the presence of ammonia, provide an audible alarm, and initiate safety systems and system shutdown if required.\n\nAMMONIA LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM AND REFRIGERATION SYSTEM AUTOMATIC CONTROLS \n\nOne of the single most important properties of ammonia from a safety perspective is its strong, pungent odor. Ammonia can be sensed by the human nose in concentrations as low 50 parts per million (ppm) in air. This odor threshold concentration of ammonia is well below the levels that pose a health hazard. Therefore, the odor of ammonia provides an early warning signal that allows people to evacuate contaminated areas and take protective actions long before significant hazards exist. \n\nAdditionally, Exel, Inc.' ammonia refrigeration facility includes a sophisticated ammonia leak detection system that automatically initiates safety systems as well as local and site alarms.  The sensing system will be capable of detecting ammonia at concentrations as low as 250 parts per million.  It is important, however, to assure that the alarms and the responses to them are commensurate with the severity of the problem."

Likewise, large leaks would require a greater level of response and initiation of precautionary actions.  For this reason, the ammonia detection system will have different responses for varying levels of detected ammonia concentration.  These responses will initiate a local alarm at 250 ppm.\n\nIn addition to the automatic controls associated with the ammonia leak sensing system, there will also be automatic controls associated with operation of the refrigeration compressors.  Each of the compressor units is controlled by a microprocessor.  Among its other functions, the microprocessor operates a series of interlocks which, in the event that pre-established critical parameters are exceeded, shut down the compressor.  As an additional safeguard, auxiliary system controls also exist to shut off the compressors if certain critical parameters for auxiliary equipment are exceeded. \n\nAMMONIA REFRIGERATION FACILITY OPERATING PARAMETER MONITORING.\n\nAmmonia Leak Detection System Automatic Controls\nAMMONIA CONCENTRATION (Parts per million - ppm).

At both the corporate and local levels, Exel, Inc. has taken significant steps to ensure safety both for its workers at the site and for the community at large.\n\nIt should be noted that the choice and introduction of ammonia as a refrigerant responds to current federal, state, and local regulations, as well as corporate commitments of  both Kraft Foods and Exel, Inc. to reduce the use of chloro-fluoro-carbon (CFC) and hydro-chloro-fluoro-carbon (HCFC) refrigerants that have been shown to cause ozone depletion and to have a higher global warming potential than ammonia. The City of Stockton restricts the use of CFCs, and the EPA has recently cited ammonia as a recommended refrigerant (EPA Short List of Alternative Refrigerants, EPA-430-F-93 004, February 1993). \n\nConstruction of the addition to the ammonia refrigeration facility in Stockton is complete, with system operation that began in February, 1996.  Exel, Inc. has implemented strict standards in the development and design of the process and both the building itself and the addition, and has overlaid administrative controls for operating, testing, inspecting, and maintaining the facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\nThe facility is located at 3735 Imperial Way, Stockton CA.  It is within the Arch Road Industrial Park, just Northeast of the intersection of Arch Road and California Highway 99.\n\nThe Arch Road Industrial Park contains many other facilities of equal and larger size.\n\nIt is a modern, well-equipped, 160,"

      "SummaryText": "000 square foot distribution center for the receipt, storage and shipping of Oscar Mayer and Kraft refrigerated products throughout northern California.\n\nThe overall facility site is an expanding industrial area, with no schools, hospitals or nursing homes within a one mile radius.  \n\nExel, Inc. refrigerated facility has been in operation since May of 1990. Since that time, the facility has not experienced an accident involving ammonia or any AHM outlined in the RMP. \n\nThis facility has not had an accident involving AHM chemicals since we began operation in May 1990.  \n\nAccident prevention is a high priority with Exel, Inc..  Exel, Inc. has corporate-wide goals, and procedures in place, to correct conditions that could lead to an accident.  The company takes numerous steps to prevent accidents and injuries, including the following: \n\nDevelops programs to provide and maintain safe work environments\n\nProvides employee training emphasizing safe work practices and potential on-the-job hazards\n\nPerforms periodic reviews of accident prevention programs and accident data to ensure that safe work practices are being followed\n\nProvides incentive programs to promote safety awareness and interest among employees\n\nAll of these programs and provisions foster employee safety and awareness of potential hazards at each site.  Provisions are also in place for employees to report accidents or conditions that could lead to an accident. Any personnel injury accidents that do occur are reported in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements. \n\nThe California Health and Safety Code requires that an RMP include a description of each accident involving the acutely hazardous material for which the RMP is being prepared that has occurred at the business or facility within the last three years of operation.  The description is to include identification of underlying causes of the accident and the measures taken, if any, to avoid a recurrence of a simila"

The Health and Safety Code uses the term accident risk to broaden the definition of accidents to include potential accidents or near misses.  The definition for accident is as follows: \n\n... a potential for the release of an AHM into the environment which could produce a significant likelihood that persons exposed may suffer acute health effects resulting in significant injury or death.\n\nSince the ammonia refrigeration facility at the Stockton site was constructed in 1990, there have been no accidents involving AHM.  As a corporation, Exel, Inc. owns and operates other ammonia refrigeration facilities.  Although not required by the RMP, accident data at these other facilities was reviewed.  This review determined that there were no ammonia-related accidents at any of Exel, Inc. currently owned or operated ammonia refrigeration facilities. \n\nDepending on the specific type of industry or process being evaluated, the definition of accident can vary significantly.  For instance, while the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) refers to accidents as incidents that involve worker injury, and does not specifically relate to release of hazardous material, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title lll defines specific federal reporting requirements for releases of hazardous material.  The SARA standards establish chemical-specific criteria for reporting releases based on the quantity of material released over a specified duration.  For example, any release of ammonia that exceeds 100 pounds in 24 hours must be reported under SARA Title lll requirements.  Unlike the OSHA standard, the SARA reporting requirements are independent of worker injury. \n\nThere have been no such accidents at any of the Exel, Inc. currently owned or operated ammoni"
