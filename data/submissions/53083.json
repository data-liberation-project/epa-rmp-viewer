VersaCold's cold storage facility in Modesto, California employs approximately 196 employees.\n\nThe VersaCold facility uses anhydrous ammonia, which is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, for its refrigeration system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage.\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, VersaCold has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect its employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis for ammonia using the IIAR what-if?/checklist methodology.  VersaCold's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia.  The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia system.  The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the ammonia system.  An audit of the PSM program was conducted in 2008, and findings are actively being addressed and resolved.\n\nThe PSM written program incorporates the site's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals, and coordination of emergency response"

      "SummaryText": "with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, VersaCold undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the system.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \n\nVersaCold stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in storage.  Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and flexibility, in addition to benefits to employee safety.  The VersaCold facility in Modesto has not experienced a release of ammonia that resulted in consequences that affected residents or environmental receptors.\n\nVersaCold is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Modesto facility.  Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system.  VersaCold employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community."
