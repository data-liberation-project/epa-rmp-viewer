      "SummaryText": "This document is the Executive Summary of the Star of the West Milling Co. - Risk Management Program - for the Ligonier Flour Mill.  The flour mill has chlorine gas on site in the form of one ton containers.  We work together with our chlorine supplier and local fire department to establish effective procedures for an immediate response and action in the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas.  We have written procedures for the handling of chlorine and conduct annual employee training on the hazards associated with chlorine and the safe handling of chlorine.  Our chlorine monitoring system monitors any potential leakage in the chlorine storage areas and the agitators.  We are committed to the safety of our employees and our community.  The flour mill provides top quality flour to a number of food companies in the midwest.  We use chlorine gas to bleach certain brands of flour and adjust their Ph.  We typically have eight one-ton containers on sight.  Four are connected at any given time; four are reserve tanks.  The containers are stored in a separate, isolated block building, which is adjacent ot the flour mill.  Preventative measures include training of our employees in safe handling of chlorine, training of our employees in the use of SCBA (Self-Contained Breating Apparatus), coordinated training with our local fire department, chlorine monitoring equipment in the chlorine room and at the agitator areas and training, monitoring and maintenance in coordination with our supplier, American Ingredients Company.  Our piping is designed for use with chlorine gas and is inspected regularly.  We have not had any reportable accidents in the past five years.  We continually strive to improve the safety of our imployees and community with safe handling and usage of chlorine at our mill."
