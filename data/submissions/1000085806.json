The facility stores formaldehyde at a stationary source in amounts greater than the RMP thresholds of 15,000 pounds.  A catastrophic release of this substance could impact public receptors; therefore, the facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving formaldehyde within the past 5 years.\n\nThe facility has performed a worse-case release scenario which estimates a potential loss of 136671 pounds of formaldehyde solution which could potentially travel up to 0.2 miles.  In the alternative, the facility has evaluated an 8,160 pound release of formaldehyde solution which could travel up to 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes is"

The facility stores isopropylamine in drums that are co-located in quantities that exceed the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving isopropylamine within the past 5 years.  The facility has performed a worst-case consequence analysis which estimates a vapor cloud explosion of 22,000 pounds of isopropylamine, which would have a radius of 0.2 miles.   In the alternative, the facility evaluated a 350 pound vapor cloud fire, which would have an impact radius of under 0.1 miles. \n\n\n\nLamberti's Emergency Response Program is compliant with RMP regulatory requirements cited in 40 CFR 68.90(b)(1)and(3), and the plant is a non-responding facility.\n\nThe facility's Emergency Action Plans/Response Program limits employees to actions to prevent small leaks or releases (e.g. shutting a valve), mitigating a release that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard, and other similar actions to minor incidents that are considered incidental responses.  Emergency actions for the facility have been coordinated with the local fire department.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program will be revised as necessary to ensure compliance with applicable RMP regulations and to improve safety.\n\n\n\nDue to recent acquisitions, there is now contiguous property ownership from Lamberti Conroe Plant 8910 to include Plant 8920 (14622 Exxon Rd, Conroe, TX 77302), and under that same industrial group.  Plant 8920 does not handle any chemical on the RMP list above threshold quantities.  However, if that changed, all processes would be reported jointly with Plant 8910 since they are a single EPA site as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.\n\n"
