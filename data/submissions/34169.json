      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Plastics Corporation operates a manufacturing plant in Auburn, Maine.  The principle products are Pionite, a decorative laminate used for counter tops and furniture, and amino resin coated paper used as a decorative surface for particle board, and other substrates.  Pioneer also manufactures specialty resins both for resale and use in the production of Pionite and low pressure laminates.  Formaldehyde is used as a monomer incorporated into Pioneer's amino resins synthesis.  Formaldehyde is delivered as a Formalin solution (50% Formaldehyde) by commercial trucks in quantities of average loads weighing 56,000 pounds four to five times per week.  The Formalin is transferred to a 20,000 gallon storage tank(approximately 140,000 pounds) and via a pipe bridge the Formalin is transferred to the production area.  Pioneer Plastics accidential release prevention program for RMP would be in conjunction with the current program regulated by the OSHA PSM requirements, Stormwater Pollution Prevention, and Wastewater regulations.  The PSM requirements have resulted in various projects by which high level alarms, vessel inspections, hazard analysis and improved operations by written procedures being implemented.  Pioneer Plastics has an Emergency Response Plan that involves the local fire departments, emergency medical personnel, and hospitals in the event of an accidential release at the facility.  The Pioneer Plastics Emergency Response Team consists of 20 to 25 members with 6 trained to the HAZMAT Technician level.  The local fire department is not trained to Technician level and will only provide support in decontamination operations and evacuation of affected residents.  SARA Title III and the Maine DEP require that the local fire department and LEPC be notified in the event of a release via telephone.  Pioneer Plastics conducts annual drills, table top excersises and meetings with the local agencies to address any public concerns.  Pioneer Plastics continuely evaluate"
