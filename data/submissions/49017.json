It is the policy of Atlanta Dairy that each employee has a safe healthful place in which to work. It is also the policy of the company to expect each employee to live up to the responsibility of following all safety rules and committing to safety. It is Atlanta Dairy's policy to coordinate adequate emergency response capabilities to handle an on site emergency regarding RMP-covered chemicals. Atlanta Dairy executes this policy through employee training, education, coordination and drills with local emergency response agencies.\n\nFacility Description \n\nThe Atlanta Dairy facility is located on 777 Memorial Drive, in eastern Atlanta, Georgia. The facility is situated just off Interstate Highway 20 in Fulton County. Atlanta Dairy produces various dairy products at this facility. Raw milk is delivered via tank trucks, and is processed to make milk, chocolate milk, buttermilk and egg nog. Additionally, various fruit juices are manufactured at this facility. The finished products are packaged for retail distribution.  Atlanta Dairy's products require constant refrigeration. The refrigeration system utilizes anhydrous ammonia in a single stage closed loop system. In general, ammonia gas is compressed and the high pressure ammonia gas then moves on to condensers located on the roof of the production facility. The ammonia is condensed to a liquid and is routed to the high pressure receiver. The receiver is located outside the compressor room. From the receiver the ammonia travels to the various coolers and process tanks where it passes through an expansion valve. The rapid expansion of the liquid ammonia returns it to the gaseous state as it removes heat from the product/room. The low pressure ammonia gas then passes through an accumulator where any remaining liquid is separated out, and then the ammonia gas feeds back to the ammonia compressors.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is purchas"

The largest quantity of ammonia is typically stored in the high pressure receiver, located outside the facility's compressor room. The high pressure receiver has a maximum capacity of 5000 pounds. However, normal operating conditions are for the high pressure receiver to maintain an inventory of 4000 pounds. The entire ammonia refrigeration system typically contains approximately 13000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nAtlanta Dairy is also covered under the Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) of highly hazardous chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119. Therefore the facility is subject to Program 3 requirements as identified in the RMP.\n\nSummary of Hazards\n\nAmmonia (NH3) at normal temperatures and pressures is a colorless gas. Each molecule of ammonia contains one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen. It is lighter than air and has a pungent odor that serves as a warning of its presence. While ammonia is a relatively toxic substance, it is not a cumulative poison. It is highly soluble in water and forms a solution known as ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or aqua ammonia (commonly used as a household cleaner).\n\nAnhydrous ammonia as the liquid form of pure ammonia gas, technically water free, and the substance used universally as an industrial refrigerant. Ammonia has a higher refrigeration effect, per unit liquid volume, than any other type of commonly used refrigerant. Other advantages are low initial cost and low pipe friction pressure losses.\n\nFor transport purposes, anhydrous ammonia is classified as a non flammable gas by the U.S. Department Of Transport (DOT).\n\nExposure to ammonia causes intense irritation to the surface tissues of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Atlanta Dairy facility involves a leak in the ammonia high pressure receiver tank that results in a"

This population size of the affected area is 500 based on the Landview 6 database data and a physical survey.\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario for the Atlanta Dairy facility was chosen to be a failure in a pressure relief valvue in a liquid ammonia line after a screw compressor. This does have the potential to impact public receptors in the area including commercial buildings. The population size of the affected area is zero based on the Landview 6 database data and a physical survey of the area..\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) relating to the covered processes resides in several forms. PSI relating to chemical hazards is included in the MSDSs that are kept in readily accessible locations for all employees. PSI relating to the process technology is generally indicated on process drawings, and is referenced in applicable operating procedures and engineering files. PSI relating to process equipment is located in the Maintenance Manager's office.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses are conducted on each covered process every five years, or when the process changes. A PHA of the ammonia refrigeration process was conducted in March 2003 and re-validated in June 2006. The PHAs are conducted as necessary to meet PSM and RMP requirements.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration process are current and accurate. The last revision/review of the operating procedures was conducted in January 2007. \n\nTraining\n\nAtlanta Dairy provides on the job training and classroom training to employees responsible for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.

Tests and inspections follow applicable and acceptable codes and standards at a frequency called for by the applicable and acceptable codes and standards, or more frequently if needed. Maintenance employees are trained on the acceptable work practices relating to the inspection and testing requirements.\nRefresher training is provided to maintenance employees on acceptable work practices relating to the inspection, testing and maintenance requirements.\n\nManagement Of Change\n\nAtlanta Dairy has a written Management Of Change (MOC) procedure that ensures that proposed changes to the ammonia refrigeration system address: the technical basis of the proposed change; the impact on environment, health and safety; modifications to operating procedures; the time period of the change and the authorization requirements for the proposed change.
