      "SummaryText": "The Shoal Creek Wastewater Treatment Facility has been treating municipal wastewater for over 55 years while remaining committed to the safety of the community and the environment. This facility takes pride in observing safety precautions in preventing hazards in the workplace, and possessing a structured contingency plan in the unlikely event of a mishap.  This treatment process includes the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the wastewater disinfection process. The quantities handled and stored typically do not exceed 5,000 pounds of chlorine, and 5,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. Worst-case and alternatave release scenarios were conducted for both chemicals. Worst case scenarios. Scenario #1: A rupture of a 2000 lb cylinder containing chlorine would be limited to 10 minutes in duration, and would release at a rate of 200 lbs per minute.The distance to the endpoint under winds of 3.4 mph would be 2.2 miles. Scenario #2: A rupture of a 2000 lb cylinder containing sulphur dioxide would be limited to 10 minutes in duration, and would release at a rate of 200 lbs per minute.The distance to the endpoint under winds of 3.4 mph would be 2.2 miles.Enclosures would serve as passive mitigation to limit the distance each chemical travels. Alternative Release scenarios. Scenario #1: A rupture of pipe connected to a 2000 lb cylinder containing chlorine would be limited to 10 minutes in duration, and would release at a rate of 50 lbs per minute.The distance to the endpoint under winds of 3.4 mph would be 0.6 miles. Scenario #2: A rupture of a pipe connected to a 2000 lb cylinder containing sulphur dioxide would be limited to 10 minutes in duration, and would release at a rate of 50 lbs per minute.The distance to the endpoint under winds of 3.4 mph would be 0.6 miles.

      "SummaryText": "ention program includes periodic review of safety information and training. Written procedures are used for hazard review, operating procedures and maintenance. Incident investigation procedures are included in our emergency action plan. The plan coordinates activities with plant personnel, emergency response personnel and Local Emergency Planning Committees to produce a maximum effective impact in the least amount of time. The plan includes a reverse 911 notification system which contacts the nearest residences fiirst and than works out  toward the endpoint. Emergency health care utilizes a 2-county EMS system.Our 5-year accident history contains no releases whatsoever."
