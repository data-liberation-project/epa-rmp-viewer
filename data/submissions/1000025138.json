This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  Regency's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOUCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nRegency operates the Dubberly Gas Plant located in Webster Parish, Louisiana.  This facility is a natural gs processing plant which uses mechanical refrigeration to remove liquids from the gas stream.  Glycol dehydration is used to remove water from the stream.  Mixed liquids from the refrigeration plant are stored in atmospheric tanks prior to being shipped off-site in tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, the Dubberly Gas Plant is a Program 3 process. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility that has not had any accidental releases.\n\n\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\n\n\nThe Dubberly Gas Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Dubberly Plant.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA?s RMP regulations and to OSHA?s PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nRegency actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.

Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nThe Dubberly Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as for key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information  provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Dubberly Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

This technique provides a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  Regency assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Dubberly Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, Regency has implemented a comprehensive tr"

Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nRegency issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  Regency provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees. Copies of issued work permits are maintained in Operations and Maintenance for a period of 1 year following completion of work.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nRegency periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, (2) follow the safety rules of the location including the safe work practices, (3) advise the plant of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and (4) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in the process areas.  \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nRegency conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed.
