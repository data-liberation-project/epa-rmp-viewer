      "SummaryText": "Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nFirst United Ethanol, LLC or FUEL will be a new 110 MGY corn-based denatured ethanol manufacturing facility in Pelham, GA. In addition to producing ethanol for fuel, the facility will produce a local source of distiller grains for use as poultry, cattle, and dairy feed.  The facility will provide a new source of carbon dioxide to the region which can be used in other manufacturing facilities.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is fed into the slurry tanks and fermentation tanks as needed to pre-treat the corn prior to fermentation.  The ammonia supplies the nitrogen source required for fermentation. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at a given time at FUEL exceeds the EPA RMP and PSM threshold quantities; thus, the facility is subject to federal EPA RMP and PSM regulations.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program\nFUEL is committed to being a responsible member of the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  FUEL has worked with the City of Camilla Fire Department in coordinating responses to any incidents involving an ammonia release.  In addition, the facility has developed its own Emergency Response Plan that documents emergency contact numbers as well as outlines steps employees should take in the event of an emergency.  It is FUEL?s policy that the Fire Department shall be contacted to respond to any emergencies involving an ammonia release.   \nThe anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with standard safety features that include emergency shut off valves, manual shutoffs, and relief valves.  \nThe anhydrous ammonia process is not part of the NAICS codes listed by EPA in 68.10(d). However, FUEL is subject to federal OSHA PSM requirements. Since there are public receptors located within the toxic endpoint zone of the worst-case release scenario, and the facility is subject to PSM regulations, FUEL?s anhydrous ammonia process qualifies for Program "

A summary of these elements follows:\n?    Management System - FUEL has assigned the RMP Coordinator as the qualified person who will have the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP.  The RMP Coordinator will be assisted by the Operations Supervisor and the Maintenance Manager in the implementation of the RMP.  \n?    Process Hazard Analysis ? A process hazard analysis was conducted in September 2008 and no major hazards were identified.\n?    Training ? Initial operator training was conducted and refresher training will be conducted at least every 3 years, more often if necessary\n?    Incident Investigation ? all incidents and accidents are investigated in order to develop methods to prevent future incidents.  An incident team is formed and the investigation results are documented.\n?    Hot Work Permits ? Hot work permits are required in classified areas.  A permitting process is in place to ensure ?hot work? is performed in a safe manner. \n?    Pre Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity ? a pre startup review was conducted in September 2008 before beginning operations.  \n?    Process Safety Information ? the MSDS for ammonia and specific hazards of ammonia are documented in the PSM plan.\n?    Contractor Safety ? contractors are required to follow the facility?s safety and environmental standards.  Contractor briefings will be conducted prior to contractors starting work at the facility.\n?    Operating procedures ? O&M manuals and SOPs are on file for all equipment and processes at FUEL. A procedure is also in place to manage changes to any equipment, processes, chemicals, or procedures.\n?    Employee Participation ? a program exists to include emplo"

This includes general orientation of the hazards, development of a safety committee, and annual training.\n?    Compliance Audits ? a compliance audit will be conducted every three years by staff familiar with the process.  All findings will be investigated, addressed, and documented. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nA process hazard analysis was conducted in September 2008.  During the review, the system was considered to be well protected with the equipment specified for the installation, such as the excess flow check valves, break away fittings, and relief valves, present.  The major concern was the consequence of the failure of the specified equipment. A recommendation from the PHA was to schedule periodic preventive maintenance on all of the specified\nequipment to keep its operation intact.  FUEL has a maintenance program that includes the ammonia system."
