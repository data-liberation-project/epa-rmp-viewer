During the review, the system was considered to be well protected with the equipment specified for the installation, such as the excess flow check valves, break away fittings, and relief valves, present.  The major concern was the consequence of the failure of the specified equipment. A recommendation from the PHA was to schedule periodic preventive maintenance on all of the specified\nequipment to keep its operation intact.

In addition to producing ethanol for fuel, the facility will produce a local source of distiller grains for use as poultry, cattle, and dairy feed.  The facility will provide a new source of carbon dioxide to the region which can be used in other manufacturing facilities.  \nAnhydrous ammonia is fed into the slurry tanks and fermentation tanks as needed to pre-treat the corn prior to fermentation.  The ammonia supplies the nitrogen source required for fermentation. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at a given time at FUEL exceeds the EPA RMP and PSM threshold quantities; thus, the facility is subject to federal EPA RMP and PSM regulations.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program\nFUEL is committed to being a responsible member of the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  FUEL has worked with the City of Camilla Fire Department in coordinating responses to any incidents involving an ammonia release.  In addition, the facility has developed its own Emergency Response Plan that documents emergency contact numbers as well as outlines steps employees should take in the event of an emergency.  It is FUEL\u00bfs policy that the Fire Department shall be contacted to respond to any emergencies involving an ammonia release.   \nThe anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with standard safety features that include emergency shut off valves, manual shutoffs, and relief valves.  \nThe anhydrous ammonia process is not part of the NAICS codes listed by EPA in 68.10(d). However, FUEL is subject to federal OSHA PSM requirements. Since there are public receptors located within the toxic endpoint zone of the worst-case release scenario, and the facility is subject to PSM regulations, FUEL\u00bfs anhydrous ammonia process qualifies for Program"
