      "SummaryText": "1) It is the policy of Zeon Chemicals L.P. to prevent the accidental release of all hazardous chemicals used or stored on this site to protect our employees, people in our community, and the environment.  The facility will maintain a current Emergency Action Plan and work closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and emergency response agencies (police, fire department, etc.) in planning for and coordinating response to emergencies involving releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Risk Management Plan submitted for this facility represents programs, policies and procedures for managing risk that have been developed and used by Zeon Chemicals since the company purchased the facility.  Most of the elements of risk management under OSHA's Process Safety Management standard were in place long before 29 CFR 1910.119 was promulgated.  Zeon Chemicals is committed to minimizing risk from the operation of this facility as part of the community.\n\n\n\n2) This facility manufactures synthetic rubber.  Synthetic rubber is made as a polymer from chemicals known as monomers.  Two of the monomers used at this plant, ethylene oxide and epichlorohydrin, are regulated substances.  A third regulated substance, ethyl ether, is used in the formulation of catalyst.  Catalyst is used to facilitate the polymerization process.\n\n\n\n  a) Ethylene oxide is received by railcar and stored in three pressurized storage tanks.  The largest ethylene oxide storage tank has a capacity of 30,000 gallons.  Company policy limits the maximum filling of this tank to 90% of its full capacity.  The maximum amount of ethylene oxide that would be stored in the largest tank is 196,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n  b) Epichlorohydrin is received by railcar and stored in two atmospheric storage tank.  The argeststorage tank has a capacity of 66,000 gallons.  Company policy limits the maximum filling of this tank to 90% of its full capacity.  The maximum amount of epichlorohydrin that would be stored in this facility is 584,000"

      "SummaryText": " pounds.\n\n\n\n  c) Ethyl ether is received by tank truck and stored in two pressurized storage tank with a capacity of the largest tank 15,000 gallons. The maximum amount of ethyl ether that would be stored in one tank is 15000 gallons.Company policy limits the maximum filling of this tank to 90% of its full capacity.  The maximum amount of ether that would be stored in the largest tank is 89,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3) Release scenarios that predict potential off-site effects have been reviewed.  Both worst case, as well as alternative, scenarios were developed.  Alternative scenarios are generally more likely with respect to the highly unlikely worst case scenarios.  However, it should be noted that even the alternative scenarios have a low probability of occurring.  The lack of an incident in the twenty five year plus history of Zeon's operation of this facility even remotely approaching the scale of the alternative scenarios coupled with Zeon's ongoing prevention program and emergency preparedness supports this view.\n\n\n\n4) This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management  Standard.  New equipment is purchased and installed per applicable codes (NFPA, etc).  A Hazard and Operability  review and Pre-startup Safety review are performed prior to operating any new equipment.  The facility's Mechanical Integrity program ensures equipment remains in good condition.  Operators and maintenance personnel use operating, maintenance and safety procedures that are constantly reviewed and updated.  Operators and maintenance personnel receive initial and periodic refresher training and must demonstrate competency before being certified or re-certified.  Accidents are investigated.  Investigation results are reviewed with employees and corrective action tracked to completion.  Process control is redundant with a distributed computer control system including alarms and interlocks.  Contractor safety is monitored and documented.\n\n\n\n5) "

      "SummaryText": "The facility incurred one reportable release in the last 5 years. A reportable release of aproximately 145 pounds of Ethylene Oxide was released when a pump failed.\n\n\n\n6) The emergency response program for the facility includes an emergency action plan, employee training, drills, and coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and local emergency response agencies.  The emergency action plan includes elements outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER standard and EPA regulations (RCRA, Storm Water, etc.).  The latest revision has been provided to emergency response agencies.  Employees responsible for emergency response are trained at the local fire and police training academy for responding to fires and chemical releases.  About two-thirds of all employees are trained to the HAZMAT Tech level of the HAZWOPER standard.  All employees are trained regarding their roles during emergencies on site and participate in drills.  Fire department personnel participate with employees in fire demonstrations and plant walkthroughs for emergency response planning.\n\n\n\n7) Changes which have occurred over the last five years include:\n\n\n\n  a) Further upgrades to secondary containment at tank farm storage areas.\n\n  b) Continued intense emergency response training.\n\n  c) Plans to install Epichlorohydrin scrubber in 2012\n\n  d) Completed the installation of deluge system on Ether Storage area.\n\n  e) Upgraded deluge system on A-Line Process.\n\n  f) Made all process deluges accesible on DCS - can manually remote trip all process deluge systems now."
