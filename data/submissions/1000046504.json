Retraining is conducted annually.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Procedure Manual that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release. This information also contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  Emergency actions and response for flammable releases have been coordinated with Grant County Fire Department.  Annual drills are held in order to review these activities with the responsible responding units.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAA\u00bfs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."

The delivery vehicles are unloaded, the containers stored and then delivered to the final user. Hydrogen chloride is considered hazardous under both Oregon and Federal regulations. Versum Materials manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices(e.g. alarms, instrumentation, relief devices)inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidnetal releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility. \r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedrues for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazaardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidnetal releases. \r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\n1.2 The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and redelivery of a variety or compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The Hyrogen Chlorine is a regulated substance that is handled in quanties that exceed the EPA and Oregon State thresholds for regulated substances. The maximum intended inventory for anhydorus hydrogen chloide is 12000 pounds in 600lb pressurized cylinders. \r\n\r\n1.3 The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's"
