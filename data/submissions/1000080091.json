The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at CRC.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nCRC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the hazards of the chemicals\n\nused in the processes, information regarding the technology of the process, and detailed equipment\n\ninformation.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nCRC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are\n\nidentified and appropriately managed. The primary methodologies used to conduct these analyses\n\nare Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and What-If studies. The studies are undertaken by a team of\n\nqualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a\n\nregular interval of 5 years. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner\n\nbased on relative risk of potential hazards.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, CRC main"

These activities are conducted by the Mechanical Integrity\n\nand Maintenance groups. Only qualified personnel are permitted to carry out inspections, tests, and\n\nmaintenance activities on process equipment and systems such as pressure vessels, storage tanks,\n\npiping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, pumps, compressors and\n\nelectrical equipment.

Furthermore, the facility has submitted their Hazardous Materials inventories and Business Emergency Plan with the local Fire Department to provide notification to first responders.  The plan consists of procedures for notification of local emergency response agencies, evacuation plans for the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation.  Emergency shutdown procedures are included in the Operating Procedures for the plant that are located at the field office, as well as on the company's shared servers.
