Furthermore, the facility has submitted their Hazardous Materials inventories and Business Emergency Plan with the local Fire Department to provide notification to first responders.  The plan consists of procedures for notification of local emergency response agencies, evacuation plans for the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation.  Emergency shutdown procedures are included in the Operating Procedures for the plant that are located at the field office, as well as on the company's shared servers.  The procedures allow for safe shutdown or isolation of the covered process and containment of potential spills or leaks.\nApplication of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with the Cal/OSHA Emergency Action Plans Standard and the emergency response element of the CalARP Prevention Program 3 requirements. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nCalNRG evaluates, and as appropriate, implements changes to improve safety as opportunities are\nidentified in PHAs, compliance audits, or by operating, maintenance, or other personnel."
