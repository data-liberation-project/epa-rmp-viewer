BASF also believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and maintaining open, constructive dialogue with our neighbors.  These principles are an integral part of our corporate vision statement and values.  We believe that sharing this information with our neighbors makes good sense.  By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\n\n\nPolicies\n\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n7 We produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\n7 We assist our customers to use our products safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  We\n  provide them with information on correct handling of our products.\n7 We minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation, \n  marketing and use of our products.\n7 Economic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\n7 An important contribution to \"Sustainable Development\" is our involvement in the \"Responsible Care\" \n  initiative worldwide.  This applies to our products and services in all our businesses and affiliates.\n7 We are committed to making continuous improvements in safety, health and environmental protection.  We \n  do this acting on our own initiative and in consultation with recognized regulatory authorities.  We take \n  any action judged to be necessary, whether or not dictated by statutory obligation or official regulations.\n7 We encourage safety, environmental and health awareness among employees.\n7 We regard it as an important corporate duty to advance science and technology in order to improve \n  safety and environmental protection.\n7 We carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of new discoveries and technologies in "

Our goals are to promote and \n  strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Site 1 implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Site 1 uses 1,3 Butadiene and Anhydrous Ammonia. Ammonia is used for cooling purposes only. 1,3 Butadiene is used to manufacture a water based emulsion polymer or dispersion. This dispersion is used in a variety of products including foams for pillows and mattresses, shoe inserts, general purpose adhesives and for asphalt modification to improve resiliency and extend the service life of streets and highways. \n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n\n7 The toxic gas release of anhydrous ammonia with off-site impacts. \n7 Vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 1,3 butadiene with off-site impacts. Administrative \n   procedures limit the 1,3 butadiene storage capacity.   \n\nAlternative\n\n7 The pipe leak of anhydrous ammonia with off-site impacts. \n7 Jet fire resulting from the release of 1,3 butadiene with off-site impacts.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release(s) over the past five years, which meet the reporting criteria.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Hazmat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard "
