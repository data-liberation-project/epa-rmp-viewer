The City of Lauderhill Department of Environmental and Engineering Services accidental release prevention\nprogram involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All \napplicable procedures of the USEPA Prevention Program are followed. The City is included in the Emergency\nResponse Plan for District XI Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The emergency response\npolicy includes this plan, and procedures for evaluating and mitigating minor on-site releases. The response\npolicy is in compliance with USEPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB. The City of Lauderhill WTP includes a chlorination system, which serves to disinfect the City water supply.\nThe system delivers chlorine gas ffom one-ton liquid chlorine containers through gas feeders and vacuum\nchlorinators. Each vacuum-type chlorinator has a built-in automatic shutdown in the event of a pipe leak,\nthereby minimizing the amount of chlorine gas released to the atmosphere. There is no presuurized piping\nin the chlorination system. The chlorination system is housed in an enclosed building, including leak detection\nand alarms, as well as an emergency chlorine scrubber, designed for catastrophic failure of a chlorine\ncontainer.A total of twelve one-ton containers may be on-site at any one time, with four containers on-line.\nThe facilty is staffed by licensed operators 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nC. The off-site consequence analysis includes \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios. Both have been \nmodeled in accordance with USEPA RMP COMP.\n\nD. The general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n     -High level of operator training\n     -Preventative maintenance program\n     -State-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n     -Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, with operator input\n     -Performance of hazard review\n     -Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nE.
