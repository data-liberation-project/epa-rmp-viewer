The Prevention Program includes:\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (19 CCR ?2760.2)\n\nRipon Energy conducts Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) at least every five years to identify, evaluate, and control the risk associated with process hazards or chemical release scenarios involving the covered processes.  The most recent PHA utilized a \"what-if analysis\" and was completed in November 2012.  Action Items are tracked to completion in Program documents.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures (19 CCR ?2760.3)\n\nRipon Energy maintains written procedures to operate the covered processes that include operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems functionality.  Applicable Operating Procedures are reviewed, updated, and certified annually or when changes are made to the Ammonia System.  Revisions are documented in the revision history of the procedure.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices (19 CCR ?2760.3)\n\nRipon Energy maintains written procedures to ensure Safe Work that include:  Safety Man"
