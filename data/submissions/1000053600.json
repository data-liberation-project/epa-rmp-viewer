The Borger Plant is located in Borger, TX, and is situated on approximately 60 acres. The plant was initially built by Phillips Petroleum and began operating in 1944 as the Philtex Experiment Station. The Philtex Experiment Station became the Philtex Plant and underwent a major expansion in 1959. \r\n\r\nThe plant produces a variety of specialty chemicals such as organo-sulfur compounds, high purity hydrocarbons, solvents, diversified organic chemicals, and aromatic polymers. These products are primarily intermediates which customers use to produce finished consumer products such as plastics, solvents and odorants. Since the original RMP filing, the use of allyl alcohol and piperidine have been discontinued and removed from this report. Chemicals used at the facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity include flammable mixtures which may contain butane, 1,3-butadiene, ethyl chloride, propylene,1-butene, 2-butene, ethyl mercaptan, 2-methylpropene, isobutene, isopentane; and toxics such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and methyl mercaptan. Since the last filing, reference to the Ryton facility has been removed because it was sold to another company on 12/31/2014.  Ryton was not required to be covered under RMP process. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Management at the Borger Plant complies with the requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation. The Borger Plant manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization. Procedures for employee involvement are detailed in site procedure POL-6020 - Implementation Roles and Responsibilities for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.  Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory"
