The Apex Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Raleigh, NC. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\nGlobal Companies - Apex Terminal in Raleigh, NC is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Global Companies believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding EHS performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Apex Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community. Global Companies promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Global Companies has designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\nA.

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Global Companies - Apex Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Apex Terminal.\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel). The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid and Bartec-Benke Analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding devices. Access to the Apex Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by our regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineered and constructed in accordance with recognized industry and company standards\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.)\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators\n-Computerized monitoring and control of process operation\n-Redundant control systems\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety devices\n-Limited facility access\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation\n\n-Automatic and remotely operated shut-offs"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release does occur, a written emergency response program is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Apex Fire Department and Wake County Division of Emergency Management.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Apex Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the facility. There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Apex Fire Department. A written emergency response program is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\nGlobal Companies - Apex Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

Tours and drills with members of local emergency response organizations are held routinely. These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the terminal.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe continually evaluate operational hazards and associated standards to determine alternative or improvements to the system to mitigate risk.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Global Companies looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. The Apex Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additionally, Global Companies will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns.\n\nAs a result of the recent PHA, a number of improvements to the risk management program have either been completed or are planned. The improvements are intended to improve the safety of the process and minimize the potential for a release. Changes primarily include program changes (improved documentation), operating procedure or checklist updates, and employee training."
