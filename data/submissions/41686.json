      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Columbia Water Treatment Plant in McBaine, Missouri (Facility) is located approximately 10 miles south-southwest of Columbia, Missouri.  The Facility supplies potable water to Boone County.  The Facility stores and uses the following Clean Air Act Section 112 (CA-112) regulated substances in the following regulated processes:\n\nSubstance ? Chlorine\nProcess ? Wastewater treatment (chlorination)\n\nThe chlorine used at the Facility is stored in 1-ton cylinders and a maximum quantity of approximately 30,000 pounds is present at any one time.  There is one chlorine process at the Facility consisting of eight cylinders in use at all times.  There have been no chlorine releases or accidents at the Facility in the past five years.  There are public receptors immediately adjacent to the Facility.  \n\nDue to the hazardous nature of chlorine, the City of Columbia Water Treatment Plant has coordinated with the Columbia Fire Department to respond to emergencies.  The Facility has generated the Risk Management Plan (RMP) to minimize the potential risk to plant personnel and surrounding communities.  A complete Prevention Program is included that is consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements for Process Safety Management.  An Emergency Response Plan has also been prepared with detailed instructions for handling a chlorine release at the Facility.  Water plant employees undergo continuous safety training and the process line is inspected daily.  In addition, the Facility has installed an automated discharge detection system (including halogen valves) that significantly reduces the risk of chlorine release.  The valves are automated and close all eight on-line cylinders immediately following detection of chlorine in the cylinder room, feed room or in the basement below the cylinder room.\n\nAs required for the RMP, the Facility has evaluated the chlorination process line to identify possible sources of chlorine releases.

      "SummaryText": " In addition, the off-Site impact of both a worst case and an alternative release scenario has been evaluated using RMP*Comp.   Results of the off-Site impact analysis is presented in the submittal.\n\nIn addition to existing prevention and response efforts, the City of Columbia Water Treatment Plant personnel are also making modifications to further insure safe ope4ration.  Emergency lighting has been upgraded, the chlorine detectors are being integrated into the SCADA system, and training and maintenance procedures are being continuously improved."
