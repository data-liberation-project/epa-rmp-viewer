The \"no odor\" policy instructs employees that detect an ammonia odor to call the Refrigeration Maintenance staff and the staff must respond immediately to the call to address the situation.\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands - Traverse City, MI has implemented and is in compliance with OSHA's PSM regulations and as such, has evaluated and engineered for anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Hillshire Brands - Traverse City, MI has trained approximately 34 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat response team).\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands - Traverse City, MI has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis by means of a SOP review session.
