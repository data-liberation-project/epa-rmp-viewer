These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits - Regularly scheduled audits will be conducted to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and conducted at least once every three years. Audit findings will be documented in a report and corrective actions required from the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner and documented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - Any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance will be promptly investigated. An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible and will involve at least one person knowledgeable of the process involved. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. A report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and will include any resolutions and corrective action.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - XcL Midstream believes that PSM and accident prevention is a team effort.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\nIt is XCL Midstream's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations. The Channing CRP facility has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is XCL Midstream's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, XCL Midstream has coordinated response activities with the Marshall County EMA and local Fire and Rescue Departments.\r\n\r\nB. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\nThe Channing CRP facility is a central receiving point for the XcL Midstream \"rich\" and \"lean\" gathering pipeline systems located in rural Marshall County, West Virginia, near Proctor, West Virginia. The products handled are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nC. The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\r\na. Worst Case Scenario:\r\nSince the Channing CRP facility does not have any toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity, the worst-case scenario was only carried out for the uncontrolled release of the largest inventory of flammable mixtures, which was more than 10,000 pounds of a mixture of flammable substances that meet criteria for the NFPA-4 rating. To carry out this analysis, it was assumed that none of the protective barriers in the facility worked.\r\nEPA assumes the worst-case scenario to be a va"

For the Channing CRP facility, it was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (NGL Storage Tank V-360) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. RMP*Comp, an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint. As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on a release of propane, a component of the mixture in the tank. Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h). The scenario involved a catastrophic release of the total quantity of the flammable substance assumed to form a vapor cloud, which detonates. Ten percent (10%) of the material in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion, 22,039 lbs.\r\n\r\nb. Alternative Case scenarios:\r\nAn alternative case scenario considered a release from the NGL Storage Tank V-360 resulting in a vapor cloud fire. Methane was selected as the predominant regulated component of the mixture, as it resulted in a greater distance to the lower flammable limit (LFL) endpoint. RMP*Comp, was used to predict a distance of 0.2 miles to the LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77\u00b0F). The scenario involved a release of 5,010 lbs/min which continues until the NGL Storage Tank is empty.\r\n\r\nD. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. The Channing CRP facility is a PSM- covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers"

Complete and accurate information on the process technology, process equipment, and hazardous characteristics and physical properties of all chemicals and intermediates for all covered processes is maintained. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - The Channing CRP facility maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Chemical- specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP method is used to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of no more than 5 years. All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, the Channing CRP facility maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.
