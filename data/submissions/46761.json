EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nPer the requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 as codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner for National Casein of New Jersey (National Casein), Riverton New Jersey, which handles one or more regulated substances listed in Appendix A of Part 68.\n\n\n1.1 STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nNational Casein of New Jersey operates a chemical manufacturing plant located in Riverton, New Jersey, which is an existing minor stationary source per the requirements of Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (New Jersey ID 45073).  The regulated substance handled by this facility is vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) which is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce industrial adhesives.  Reactor 101 (R-101) and reactor 201 (R-201) are used to polymerize the VAM with various other minor monomers to form non-hazardous polyvinyl acetate copolymer water based emulsions.  VAM is received by tanker truck into a storage tank.  When required, it is delivered to reactors 101 and 201 via pipeline.  The polymer emulsions produced are used and sold as high performance woodworking adhesives.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of VAM that can be stored or handled at this facility is 78,000 pounds.\n\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nNational Casein has a policy to prevent accidental releases.  At the Riverton, New Jersey facility, National Casein handles VAM, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  Because of this reason, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling VAM to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to r"

      "SummaryText": "educe the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle VAM combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire authorities and various emergency agencies.  Special procedures are included on the handling of a VAM spill as well as specific procedures to be followed in the case of an emergency.\n\n\n1.3 WORST-CASE & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the outdoor VAM storage tank.  For this release scenario it is assumed that the contents of the tank are instantaneously spilled, and the spill is released into the atmosphere.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario. - Failure of the hose connecting a tanker truck and the VAM storage tank during material loading. \n\n\n1.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  All VAM process equipment undergoes scheduled inspection and preventative maintenance to assure that all equipment is in good working order and therefore the chances of an accidental VAM release is reduced.  The VAM tank is enclosed within a concrete barrier which is enclosed within a stainless steel shell.  The reactors are located within a building which will contain the entire contents of the tanks as well as enclose all of the contaminated air in the event of an accidental release.  Both of these methods of containment of an accidental release will reduce any impact to the surrounding communities.  Training of employees occurs on a regular basis as well as fire drill and safety"

The Riverton, Cinnaminson, and Palmyra Fire Department phone numbers have all been listed as well as the phone numbers for the Burlington County Health Department and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) HotLine.\n\n\n1.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis facility will undergo regular scheduled maintenance and inspections which will detect any problems at the facility.  Any mechanical or structural deficiencies found will be reported and fixed at once.  Hazard reviews and compliance audits will be completed on a regular basis to show any deficiencies present and/or find any ways of improving the safety of the VAM process.  These deficiencies and suggestions of improving safety will be corrected and implemented which will allow National Casein, Riverton to improve on their already safe operation of the VAM process."
