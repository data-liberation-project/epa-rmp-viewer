These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  The Ethane-Propane-Butane-Pentane Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of the entire inventory in the largest storage vessel.

The Sugarloaf Stabilizer completed a hypothetical scenario which was modeled based on a failure on a pump.   \r\n\r\nPassive mitigation systems such as leak detection, gas detection, and emergency shutdown systems would enable the facility to isolate and eliminate such a release within that timeframe.  The alternative release scenario has no off-site impact (i.e., residential populations) as determined by the use of RMP*Comp modeling.   \r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Sugarloaf Stabilizer adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Sugarloaf Stabilizer.  The Sugarloaf Stabilizer has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program regulations for consistency and effectiveness.  As a result, this overview describes the safety management system that is in place for each of the safety management program elements, which also make up the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nAll employees (and contractors) at the Sugarloaf Stabilizer are involved and participate in all facets of Process Safety Management (PSM) and"

As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator, as a mentor, to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through peer review and skills demonstration) the knowledge level needed to perform their duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, then and only then, will they be allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a high level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary and no less than every 3 years.  All this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Sugarloaf Stabilizer uses contractors to perform many project-specific activities and supplement the facility workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction periods. \r\n \r\nFor those contractors who work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place, that when followed, ensure that these contractors:\r\n\r\n* Will perform their work in a safe manner.\r\n* Have the appropriate knowledge and skills to work safely around the process.\r\n* Are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\r\n* Understand what they should do in the event of an incident.\r\n* Understand and follow site safety rules.\r\n* Will inform facility personnel of any hazards that their work brings and/or that they find during their work.\r\n\r\nThe Sugarloaf Stabilizer has developed and implemented safe work practices and procedures to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employers and employees in covered process areas.\r\n\r\nEach contract employee is provided with site-specific training on th"

ConocoPhillips personnel periodically monitor contractor safety programs and performance records.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThroughout the life of any operating facility, changes will often be necessary -- for example, to meet changing circumstances, to make needed improvements, or to alter the technology of the process.  The Sugarloaf Stabilizer has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the facilities processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by several people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  The MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.  A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary trainin"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSR's is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on the modification, including any revisions to the operating procedures or to the safety systems and controls.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly modified process or equipment.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention, Process Safety Management Program, and Risk Management Program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Sugarloaf Stabilizer has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment in a safe operating condition.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and underlying cause(s) of the incident to develop corrective actions and implement steps to prevent a recurrence of the incident and prevent similar incidents.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent similar incidents, and forwards these results to management for further action. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are fully implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected.
