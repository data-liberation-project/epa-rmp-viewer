In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local agencies by providing information and offering tours to ensure that they are familiar with and are properly prepared for an incident ar out facility.  This will help ensure that the community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies wiht the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nJohnston Grain has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for our facilities that include provisions for public notification, initial medical care, evacuations, and LEPC coordination.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.

This plan has been developed to prevent accidental release through responsible handling and proper storage of the product.  Johnston's will also ensure that employees receive the necessary training and that proper safety equipment is provided.  Johnston's will also make sure that the surrounding community is aware of our preparedness in the event of an accident.\n\nJohnston's Covington facility is a full service, country elevator, which sells feed, seed, fertilizer, as well as agricultural chemicals.  The only substance subject to regulation under RMP and above the threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed from our facility as a crop feritlizer only.  Our facility has one storage tank that has 12,000 gallons capacity and is filled to only 85%, this equals 56,000 pounds of ammonia.  We also have  fifteen (15) 1000 gallon Nurse tanks also filled to a maximum of 85% full at our location.  The combined capacity of all tanks at this location is 27,000 gallons or 126,050 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThis facility has a site safety coordinator, all Johnston coordinators are given training to monitor the day to day safe work"

      "SummaryText": "activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct safety meetings, conduct employee training, and act as the location's contact with the corporate office.  The site safety coordinator acts as the location's emergency contact.\n\nAs required by EPA guidelines the following worst-case release and alternative release scenarios have been devised.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nOur worse case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release(distance from point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impacts, and would travel .84 miles.  It should be noted that Johnston's has never had a release of an entire stationary anhydrous ammonia storage tank from any of its facilities.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would be in the failure of a 1-inch transfer hose and release of approximately 2901 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a two-minute period.  Under the worst weather conditions the contents would travel .22 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  It should be noted that Johnston's has not had a release of this type from any facility in the past.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standards, OSHA(29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, and manual shutoffs.
