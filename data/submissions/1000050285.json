The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Keota Gas & LNG Plant is located near Briggsdale in Weld County, Colorado. It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane). The only process in the plant that contains an above threshold quantity of a regulated substance is the Product Storage Tank. There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the Keota Gas & LNG Plant.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Keota Gas & LNG Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific PSM program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM. Since this facility is a Program Level 1 facility, a prevention program is not required under RMP.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Keota Gas & LNG Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Keota Gas & LNG Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/"

Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNoble Midstream believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Noble continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Noble also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is a high priority."
