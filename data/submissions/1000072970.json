This information along with updated Operation Manuals is available in assigned locations throughout the facility. Operation manuals are developed, updated, and reviewed by Operations personnel and the Training Department. These Operation Manuals assist employees in refresher training and Operator Recertification Programs.\r\n\r\nSafety meetings are held on a regular basis for Operations, Maintenance, Terminal, Administration, and Contract personnel. Topics chosen are relevant to respective personnel assigned duties, and general and specific information is provided as informational instruments to enhance employee participation in facility-wide safety performance.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nSE Tylose keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe process operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within SE Tylose are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets. For specific process areas, SE Tylose has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit. SE Tylose promotes maintaining process parameters within limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nSE Tylose also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, the existing covered process and potential future processes are systematically examined.\r\n\r\nSE Tylose primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of personnel who exhibit operating, maintenance, and process engineering experience and expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are warranted.\r\n\r\nSE Tylose periodically updates its PHAs of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nSE Tylose maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, SE Tylose has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in SE Tylose operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures in order to maintain skills and knowledge at an acceptable level.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\n\r\nSE Tylose uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, SE Tylose has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform SE Tylose personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work.

SE Tylose personnel monitor contractor performance to evaluate the level at which contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS\r\n\r\nSE Tylose conducts a pre-startup safety review for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. This review provides that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to corroborate that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\n\r\nSE Tylose uses established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include:\r\n\r\n*Conducting training\r\n*Developing written procedures\r\n*Performing and documenting inspections and tests\r\n*Correcting identified deficiencies\r\n*Applying quality assurance measures \r\n\r\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.

SE Tylose incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This practice assesses suitability of new equipment for its intended use and establishes that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\n\r\nSE Tylose has safe work practices in place to sustain worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to foster that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\nSE Tylose has a comprehensive system to manage process changes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

All affected employees are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.  \r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nSE Tylose will investigate incidents that result in, or could reasonably result in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which can include contractors, will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to SE Tylose's management for resolution. Corrective actions will be taken in response to the investigation team's findings, and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results will be reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\r\n\r\nSE Tylose will periodically conduct audits to confirm the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. The final resolution of each finding is documents and the audit reports are retained. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe process at the facility has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the facility. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of releases of RMP regulated chemicals caused by equipment failures or human errors.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURES\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, SE Tylose has many safety features to help prevent the accidental releases of regulated substances in"

These features include but are not limited to: \r\n\r\n*Operating parameter monitors with alarms\r\n*Process relief systems\r\n*Isolation valves (manual or automated)\r\n*Buried tanks to mitigate explosion impact\r\n*Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n*Process relief valves to prevent overpressure damage to equipment\r\n\r\nHOT WORK PERMIT\r\n\r\nThe facility's hot work procedure requires that detailed permitting activities take place before, during, and after any job that has the potential to provide a source of ignition. The permit is followed through to completion of the work and those permits are maintained on site. The facility implements other work permits as necessary to assure safe work conditions are communicated to maintenance and contract personnel.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nSE Tylose is committed to minimizing potential risks to the public, employees and environment. A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Within the past five years, there has not been a release of a regulated substance from a regulated process. In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, information relating to any accidental release that results in death, injury, significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage will be documented for the facility and provided in future RMP submittals. Any accidental release involving a reportable RMP chemical will be reported to the federal and state emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nSE Tylose maintains a comprehensive written emergency response plan (ERP) to protect employees, public health, and the environment. The plan includes procedures for responding to a release. The plan consists of procedures f"
