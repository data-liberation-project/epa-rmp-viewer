Audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The Hawkins Water Treatment Group - Starke Facility is a chemical distribution warehouse that stores and distributes a number of materials used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  The product covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility is chlorine.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping and storage.  This starts with DOT approved cylinders that are robustly designed to contain chemicals through all conditions expected during processing as well as mishandling that could cause a cylinder to fall or shift during transport.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures, and equipping them with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.  We also follow industry standards, such as those of the Chlorine Institute, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History:  There has not been an RMP accident at this facility since the facility has been owned and operated by Hawkins, Inc.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response:  In the event of a chlorine release, Hawkins Water Treatment Group employees are trained to investigate the situation and if needed:\r\n1. Call the local fire department for hazmat assistance.\r\n2. Evacuate to a safe distance.  \r\nThe local fire department has toured the facility and is aware of the chemicals on site.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than continued compliance to industry standards and government regulations and our"
