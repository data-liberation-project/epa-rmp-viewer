The facility has one refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance under the RMP regulations.  The system is used to chill water, maintain temperatures in processing areas, spiral freezing, and freezer storage.\n\n\n\nThe location has prepared worst case release scenario using the RMPComp air dispersion modeling software.  The alternative case release scenario was prepared using RMPComp air dispersion modeling software. \n\n\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nSince this is the initial start-up, this facility has not had any accidental releases of "
