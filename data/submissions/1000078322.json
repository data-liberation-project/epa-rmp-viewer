In the event of an inspection or compliance review, state and federal regulators will request to see documentation and record keeping associated with the Maintenance Program. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nAn Incident Investigation Program has also been developed. The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the chlorine system. The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently. Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learns from the incident and takes action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document.

This statement is based on a 2400 SCFM chlorine gas release rate and a 3000 SCFM \r\nscrubber exhaust rate that maintained the chlorine building under negative pressure during the entire period of the release.

The disinfection process is covered under this regulation at the Jefferson Parish West Bank Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  This document contains information on the chlorine systems at the West Jefferson Water \r\nTreatment Plant that may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the current mitigation systems, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.  An Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs have been incorporated into both initial and recurring training.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment\r\n\r\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario for the chlorine system, as well as a 5-Year Accident History for the same. Because the West Bank WTP is located in a residential neighborhood and is not subject to OSHA programs, the West Bank WTP is categorized in Risk Management Program Level II.  \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario \r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario is defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10-minute duration and includes the passive mitigation related to the chlorine building. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 0.9 miles at the 3 ppm toxic endpoint concentration specified by EPA using the RMP*Comp ver.1.07 software.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario of chlorine was based on a fusible plug release from an overfilled 1-ton cylinder containing 2350 lbs with a release rate of 43"
