      "SummaryText": "The City of Azusa water treatment facilities use the acutely hazardous material (AHM) chlorine in sufficient quantity to warrant the establishment of a RMP program.  Water is treated with chlorine at two sites in Azusa, employing the same basic chlorination process at each of the sites.  The Canyon Chlorination Facility located at the base of  San Gabriel Canyon in Azusa has been in operation since 1994. In this time the Canyon Chlorination Facility has  had no accidental releases of Chlorine.\n\nDuring normal operation the maximum chlorine supply is two 1 ton containers, with one empty container awaiting retrieval by the chlorine supplier.  The Canyon Chlorination Facility is equipped with a hoist for lifting and movement of the chlorine ton containers.  The chlorinator system is connected to a valve in the vapor space of the chlorine container.  Chlorine gas passes from the supply container through a vacuum (negative pressure) regulating valve.  Should the system vacuum be lost, due to either a shutdown of the water flow or a break in the chlorine supply line, the vacuum regulator at the tank outlet closes, isolating the chlorine supply container and preventing a gaseous release.  \n\nIn the event of a release of chlorine the Canyon Chlorination Facility employess a chlorine scrubber system  and automatic shutdown valves.  In addition, the Canyon Chlorination Facility has a chlorine detector that will notify the Operator on duty in the event of a release.  All Operators have been trained in the use of an SCBA.  All Operators have been trained and certified as a hazardous material first responder and will call 911, notify local emergency agencies ( City of Azusa EOC ) and also will notify the chlorine supplier.  The Canyon Chlorination Facility is located in a rural area.  In the event of a release,  the danger should be minimal unless all safety devices fail."
