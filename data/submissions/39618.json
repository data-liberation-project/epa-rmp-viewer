      "SummaryText": "Duron Paints and Wallcoverings (Duron) operates a latex paint mixing and packaging facility at 1415 Constitution Road in Atlanta, Dekalb County, Georgia.  Bulk raw materials at this facility are brought in by truck and railcar, mixed in industrial size vats, and dispensed into the finished product containers including primarily quart, one gallon, and five gallon sizes.  The containers are labeled, cased, and placed in warehouse for shipment.\n\nAerosol canisters containing propane, butane, and isobutane as propellants are stored in a designated warehouse at the Duron facility.  The maximum number of aerosol canisters stored in this warehouse at any given time is 20,000.  Each canister contains up to 14 ounces of material, of which approximately 20 to 30 percent is comprised of the propellants listed above.  These propellants are considered as regulated substances in a flammable mixture.  In accordance with 40 CFR \u00a768.115 (b) (2), for purposes of calculating the threshold quantity (TQ) of the regulated substance on-site, the entire flammable mixture (14 ounces of material in each canister) is regulated because the concentration of each flammable propellant in the mixture is greater than one (1) percent.  Therefore, Duron exceeds the TQ for flammable mixtures of 10,000 pounds.  The warehousing operation is therefore a regulated process covered under the RMP regulations.\n\n\tThere have been no reportable accidents at the facility within the past five years (June 1999 through June 2004, the 5-year period prior to the resubmittal of the RMP to USEPA) meeting the 40 CFR \u00a768.42 criteria.\n\nTo ensure that all components of accidental release management are covered in the RMP, a facility is also required to address emergency response planning.  RMP requires that a Program 1 facility coordinate with local responders to ensure they are prepared to respond to an incident at the facility and establish an appropriate mechanism for notification of the emergency responders when response"

      "SummaryText": "is needed. \n\nThe facility maintains and follows a continuously updated Emergency Response Contingency Plan.  The Dekalb County Fire Department has been identified as the local responder to emergencies at the facility.  Fire department personnel visit the Duron facility regularly to prepare for a response to emergency.  All the appropriate emergency contacts for any given situation are clearly identified in the Plan.  The Emergency Response Contingency Plan for the facility outlines a procedure for the event of an actual emergency.  \n\nBased on prior coordination with the local fire department and the facility\u00bfs associated response procedures, an effective response to potential flammable releases has been established, and the facility is in compliance with all RMP emergency-planning requirements."
