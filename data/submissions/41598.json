Also, the facility stores propane to refuel 40-pound forklift tanks on a demand basis, and in the event the facility loses their natural gas supply, stored propane plays a secondary role to provide emergency / backup fuel for three boilers.\n\nSenior management at Farmer John is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management as well as the Safety Director administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFarmer John has a emergency response team in place that has coordinated their emergency response efforts with the local fire department, the City of Vernon Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Farmer John to evacuate the employees and to allow the HazMat team / fire department respond to the emergency.\n\nThe majority of the ammonia equipment is located inside the engine rooms.  However process rooms and cold / freezer storage rooms do have small flooded accumulator / evaporator units and piping.  The propane system is located in the center of the facility, just east of the Hog Pens.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia or propane.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Farmer John facility is located at 3049 East Vernon Avenue in Vernon, California. The facility is situated directly south of the Los Angeles River / Channel and approximately"

The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban, comprised of a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia System\n\nRefrigeration at Farmer John is achieved via three anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems which are titled the North, Plant, and Soft Chill Systems.  The North and Plant Systems are interconnected via one normally closed liquid line which is opened only in the rare event that ammonia must be transferred quickly from the North to South Engine Room.  Also, occasionally the Soft Chill and Plant Systems are interconnected via the Pump-out Compressor.  The Pump-out Compressor is set to pull suction from either the Plant or Soft Chill System (only one system at a time).  Two bolted flanges keep the suction line `switch-over' pipe securely fastened to one of the two systems.  The compressor's discharge line is normally connected to the Plant System's Intermediate Pressure Accumulator / Intercooler but can be setup to send ammonia vapor to the Soft Chill System's compressor suction line or Water Diffusion Tank (again via a switch-over pipe).\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems that transform the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back to a liquid.  The systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, transform ammonia through various cyclical physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for processing areas and cold / freezer storage rooms.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature as portions of the liquid flash to vapor.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the a"

The system is started and shut down as required by facility operations.  Farmer John utilizes stored propane primarily to refill 40-pound forklift tanks.  However, in the event the facility loses their natural gas supply, the propane system plays a secondary role to provide emergency / backup fuel for three boilers.  The boilers create steam which is used to heat water and cook food products throughout the facility.\n\nPropane is stored inside two 126,000-pound (100% full capacity) storage tanks.  The tanks are interconnected via a equalizing line such that they share a common liquid level, usually 20 to 30% of individual tank capacity.  The system has two connection ports where forklift tanks can be filled.  One of the ports is equipped with a pump to increase the rate of liquid propane transfer.  To save time, the facility's normal operating procedure is to utilize the pump connection port.\n\nThe heat exchanger is a vaporizer / mixer / receiver package which converts liquid propane to a mixed gas which is interchangeable with natural gas.  The heat exchanger process is akin to the forklift tank filling process in that it begins by having operating engineers use the lever pulling device to open a different / distinct set of isolation valves.  When used, the levers open isolation valves at the storage tanks, which allows propane to flow directly to the heat exchanger.  Liquid propane from the large storage tanks enters the heat exchanger's shell where contact with hot condenser tubes (filled with steam) causes boiling of the liquid, which allows propane vapor to rise above the exchanger's liquid level.  Mixed gas is formed"

Propane vapor passes through a nozzle, which creates suction at an air inlet valve and also propels the newly formed mixture through a diffuser into the receiver.  The mixture stays inside the receiver until required by the boilers.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe Farmer John ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Operating Engineering, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, work at the facility to regularly maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the South Engine Room.  If ammonia is detected at a concentration of 250 ppm, audible and visual alarms are triggered  inside the room.  Upon detection of 25,000 ppm, the detectors will de-energize the south engine room and activate ventilation fans which move the air/ammonia mix through a scrubber located on the roof.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases.  The system must be manually restarted following a power outage.\n\nThe system also incorporates pressure relief valves.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to the atmosphere or water diffusion tank (depending on location) via relief lines.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.

The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately by the refrigeration contractor.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems is used as a general guide.\n\nPropane\n\nThe Farmer John propane system also has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  As an example, the facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  Operating Engineers, who are seasoned propane technicians, work at the facility to regularly maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nAdditional safety measures include relief valves and a water sprinkler system.  Each tank is equipped with three relief valves, which are installed inside galvanized vent pipes and set to actuate at 250 psig.  The heat exchanger's vaporizer and mixed gas receiver are also equipped with relief valves, which are both set to actuate at 250 psig.  Last, enclosing the propane system is a deluge-type sprinkler system, which is aimed directly at the storage tanks and heat exchanger.  The sprinkler system can be manually activated in the case of an emergency.  Last, access to the propane area is limited. The area is fenced and the gate is locked. Only the Superintendent, trained workers, and plant security have keys.\n\nThe facility operates in accordance NFPA-58, 1998, which is propane guidance standard used in California.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into Farm John's accident history reveale"
