      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n \r\n\r\n1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Hiland Roberts Ice Cream Company in Norfolk, Nebraska is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store ice cream and related dairy products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 26,800 pounds (i.e., 5,400 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 9,500 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 3,600 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  The Norfolk plant is located in a rural setting.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration at the Norfolk plant is a two-stage system consisting of a high (pressure) side and a low (pressure) side.\r\n\r\nThe ice cream processing units (barrel freezers) and storage freezers operate on the low side (low pressure and, therefore, low temperature).  Ammonia suction from the units, at about 0"

Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the liquid recirculator and pumped-out to the low side load units.  The booster discharge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors. \r\n\r\nThe high stage compressor suction draws from the intercooler (booster discharge) and two high side suction accumulators at about 25 psig.  These accumulators receive suction from the ice builder, air handlers, various cooler units, and the milk silos.  Ammonia liquid which collects in the high side accumulators is transferred by pumper drums to the control pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nDischarge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to three roof-mounted condensors.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrost, operation of the pumper drums, and for the control pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to either the control pressure receiver or to the low pressure liquid recirculator.  The liquid passes through a liquid cooler before entering the low pressure liquid recirculator. \r\n\r\nThe control pressure receiver is used to supply high pressure liquid to the high side load units.  The pressure of the liquid is maintained by feeding hot gas into the vessel.\r\n\r\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  These include pressure relief valves, engine room ventilation, and safety interlocks.  \r\n\r\nSafety relief valves (SRVs) protect the compressor discharge, condensors, pumper drums, suction accumulators, intercooler, and liquid recirculation system from overpressurization.  SRVs on the compressor discharge and condensers are set at 250 psig.  SRVs for the suction vessels are set at 150 psig.\r\n\r\nSafety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cut-outs for the compressors, as well as high level floats and/or sensors for the ve"

If a discharge pressure of 180 psig is reached in the system, an alarm sounds. if the pressure continues to rise to 210 psig, the compressors and boosters are shut down.  If the intermediate pressure increases to 30 psig, an alarm also sounds.  If the pressure continues to rise to 40 psig, the boosters are shut down.\r\n\r\nFloat switches on the suction vessels alarm when a high level is reached.  If the liquid level continues to rise, additional float switches and/or level control shut off the appropriate compressors or boosters to avoid slugging.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact.  Moreover, a release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\r\n\r\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\r\n\r\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\r\n\r\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\r\n\r\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system;\r\n\r\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\r\n\r\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing valves in the liquid lines.\r\n\r\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence o"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\r\n\r\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \"What-if/checklist\" technique.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.

The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\r\n\r\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \r\n\r\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\n* Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  \r\n\r\n* Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\r\n\r\n* Periodic formal walk-throughs occur to find unusual or increasing vibration, incipient leaks, or other indications of potential upsets or failures that could lead to a release.\r\n\r\n* Replacemen"
