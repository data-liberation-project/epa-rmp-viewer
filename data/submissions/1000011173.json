Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMulti-Chem is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  Multi-Chem personnel work continuously to identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is one of Multi-Chem's core values as documented in policy and compliance manuals, and in its mission statement, which are available to all employees.\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nAcrolein, also known as 2-propenal, is an aldehyde.  It is present between 92-96% pure in the product received in the Acrolein tanks.  It is inhibited by hydroquinone (0.35%) and covered with a nitrogen blanket to prevent hazardous polymerization.  Acrolein is acutely toxic, as well as an inhalation and fire hazard.  Some of the typical physical and chemical properties listed below.\nA? CAS # 107002-8\nA? Clear, colorless liquid\nA? Acrid and pungent odor, extremely irritating\nA? pH 7\nA? flashpoint of A? 13 F (TCC)\nA? heavier than air\nA? can produce exothermic hazardous polymerization reaction\nA? can be neutralized with soda ash or sodium bisulfite (increasing the pH results\nin decreased half-life)\nA? OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL), 0.1 ppm\nA? OSHA short term excursion limit (STEL), 0.3 ppm\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMulti-Chem, Denver City has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of Multi-ChemA?s release prevention program that are in place at the Denver City facility.\n\nProcess Information:\nAc"

      "SummaryText": "rolein is trucked onto the site in ISO tanks - each ISO tank containing 4,970 gallons (34,783 lbs) of acrolein. The ISO tanks are detached from motive transport prior to transfer into pressurized skids called \"field containers.\" Each field container can contain a maximum of 399 gallons (2,797 lbs.) of inhibited acrolein.  Inhibited acrolein indicates that the hydroquinone is added to slow oxygen catalyzed polymerization. Additionally, the head space at the top of the cylinder is filled with pure nitrogen.  The maximum expected inventory of acrolein at the Multi-Chem facility is 278,623 pounds (twenty-five 2,797 lb acrolein field containers plus six 34,783 lb ISO tanks).  There are no acrolein chemical processes involved at the Multi-Chem facility as no product is used at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nThe HAZOP method will be employed by Multi-Chem personnel to systematically identify, analyze and correct potential hazards associated with the storage, handling and movement of acrolein at the facility.     After completion of the initial process hazard analysis, the HAZOP will be reviewed and the finalized. The process hazard analysis findings worksheets will be used to document the findings, recommendations, corrective actions and completion dates. It will also be used to document that the affected employees have been informed of the recommendations or actions.  The EHS/DOT Director and Denver City Facility Manager are responsible for ensuring that any recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented.  The Denver City Facility Manager will ensure that the affected employees are informed of any changes.  The HAZOP analysis will be updated and revalidated every five (5) years to ensure that the process hazard analysis is consistent with the current process and handling procedures.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Multi-Chem Denver City will maintain wri"

The information will be regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators involved with the processes. \n\nTraining:\nEach employee presently involved in operating the process and new employees, will be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures for acrolein prior to handling acrolein.  The training will include emphasis on the health and safety hazards, emergency operations including shutdown and safe work practices.  Forklift training and certification is conducted as required by OSHA requirements.  Hazard awareness and container storage and handling training will be given to Materials Handlers who may have occasion to on or off load the containers.  Awareness training will be given to all employees to be aware of the hazards of the product, to recognize the containers and to avoid any possible exposure to the material.\n\nRefresher training will be provided at least every three years or more often if necessary.  The training will assure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  The Facility Manager or designated supervisor will discuss and determine with the employees the frequency of the refresher training.  Forklift drivers receive refresher training and recertification every three years as required by OSHA.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nIn accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119, a maintenance equipment program involving documented inspections and testing of equipment will be implemented.  The following equipment will be included in the maintenance program:\nA? Acrolein Tanks (including all valves attached to tank)\nA?

Routine checks, which will be performed on these containers, are as follows:\n\nA? Upon receipt of acrolein containers: Visually check containers for bulging, corrosion or significant cuts or gouges. Also check the container shut-off and safety valves for any visual defects.  Any containers showing any significant defect will be rejected and returned to the supplier.
