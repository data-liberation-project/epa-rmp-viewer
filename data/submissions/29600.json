This event was selected as a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  This ARS has no off site impact.\n\nAs stated in 68.28(b)ii, an alternative case scenario is required if it is more likely to occur than a worst-case scenario and if it will reach an endpoint offsite. Based on the EPA lookup tables, the more credible scenarios identified for the alternative case scenarios resulted in no release reaching the property line and therefore had no off site consequence.\n\nNo Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated flammable substances were identified at the refinery.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) Eagle Point Refinery.  The covered process at the refinery is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as NJDEP Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program N.J.A.C. 7:31 (1-6) and to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119.  The following summary addresses the combined elements of these three programs and describes the activities surrounding the implementation of each element. A separate detailed management system document is available for review at the site.\n\nEmployee Participation\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M) Eagle Point Refinery involves employees in the programs developed to support process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees are included in every element of the program, from development, to active participation, to program updates.  They are members of the process hazard analysis (PHA) team, the compliance audit team and make up the safety and emergency response teams. They implement the mechanical integrity, operator training and contractor safety programs.  \n\nEmployees have access to information created as part of thi"

      "SummaryText": "Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) Eagle Point Refinery\nRisk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M) has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the development of refinery programs that support accident prevention.  These programs include detailed operator training, qualification and refresher training program, annual safety training and consideration for safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our refinery processes.  \n\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M)'s practice is to determine appropriate administrative and mechanical controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release were to occur, our response team members are well trained to respond and control the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nSunoco, Inc. (R&M) Eagle Point Refinery, located in Westville, New Jersey, operates a number of different process functions to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, fuel oil, propane and butane from raw crude oil. The facility has fixed inventories of butane and propane and uses chlorine, which is used for disinfection and treatment of cooling water at the refinery cooling towers. Through the course of routine process operation, a flammable mixture stream is generated containing covered flammables. The entire refinery has been classified as a single process, with multiple production units. This classification ensures that all regulated chemicals that meet the criteria defined by the EPA Risk Management Program are included in this program.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in the refinery is a catastrophic failure of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine.  Based on the criteria adopted by the EPA, this scenario would result in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas over a 10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to preven"

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for this WCS is 1.3 miles.  No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated toxic substances were identified at the refinery.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine is a 3/8-inch valve sheared off due to torque while opening or closing the valve, resulting in a release of 345 lbs. of Chlorine gas over a 10-minute period.  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 10 minutes (active mitigation). The basis for the 10-minute mitigation is actual response time demonstrated in emergency response drills performed at the site.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario is 0.10 miles, which does not reach any offsite public receptors.\n\nThe WCS of flammable substances in Program 3 at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing normal Butane. \n\nNo administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank, therefore, the full tank inventory of 2,520,400 lbs. is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.09 miles.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this WCS.  Some of these controls include leak detection, alarms, interlocks, shutdowns, over pressure safeguards and scheduled equipment inspections. \n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the failure of a 4-inch truck loading hose failure.  This would result in a release of 1,817 lbs./minute released over a 15 minute period.  The release"

(R&M) Eagle Point Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  Also, when significant changes are to be made to a production unit that may require major construction, a HAZOP team will be assembled to review the recommended changes to determine the effect on the existing process before construction design considerations are complete.  The results and findings from these review and revalidation activities are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are reviewed with management for consideration, and the final resolutions are documented and retained.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\nSunoco, Inc.

A table summarizing these documents, their latest revision dates and their location is readily available to help employees locate information related to the process safety information developed at the refinery.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response  exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For each production unit, the refinery has documented operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level and pressure) in the Normal Operating Conditions (NOC) section of the Standard Operating Procedures Manuals.  \n\nThe refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument\nsystems such as alarms, interlocks and automatic shutdown systems.\n\nSunoco, Inc.
