The company is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees. The Corporate Mission is to continue in a leadership role as a good corporate citizen and encourage employees' active participation in the communities served. The Shenango Water Treatment Plant conducts a safe, productive business, contributing to the community while minimizing risk to employees and neighbors.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent to provide safe drinking water.  We are careful to understand the hazards and safely manage it. Our policies and programs call for preventing accidental releases, mitigating them on-site and being prepared in the event of an emergency to minimize the effects on employees and the public.  To ensure that a chemical release does not occur, the Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program encompassing the twelve elements of both EPA RMP and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. A management Team, consisting of qualified management personnel located onsite and at Corporate Headquarters, is accountable for implementation, enforcement and oversight of the above elements of the release prevention program.\n\n\n\nIn addition to prevention programs, chemical-specific prevention steps include:\n\n\n\n> Vacuum regulators mounted directly on the containers that automatically shut down the chemical flow if there is a leak on piping or equipment.\n\n> Leak detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems.\n\n> A release recovery scrubber automatically activated by a leak alarm and designed to render a worst-case release harmless.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAs an indication of the effectiveness of the above-mentioned programs, the site has experienced no accidental releases of chlorine "

      "SummaryText": "within the past five years that resulted in, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nEmergency Response to any potential incident at the plant is accomplished in accordance with the site's integrated Contingency Plan. We regularly coordinate emergency response with the Fire Department and regional emergency planning and management agencies. The integrated Contingency Plan identifies emergency responder notification procedures in the event that a release escaped our containment systems. Our plans comply with the emergency response requirements of OSHA, EPA and PADEP. We regularly train on the hazards, emergency awareness and procedures and conduct drills to maintain our effectiveness.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nWe have already installed state-of-the art protective systems and continually work to safely manage chemical hazards to protect our employees and the community we serve. Each year we will review procedures, maintain equipment, follow safe work practices and coordinate with community emergency responders.  Periodically, we will audit our program, update our Process Hazard Analysis and implement any additional improvements recommended by these evaluations. Based on these evaluations, we recently upgraded access to a chemical feed location and installed improved vehicle impact protections. We will be improving emergency scrubber system ventilation flow patterns. We continue this process on an ongoing basis.\n\n    \n\nNotes: Worst-case scenario distances changed due to differences in storage configuration. Limitations in CDX/RMP*eSubmit required adjusting the Alternative Release Total lbs. up to the minimum value, the release rate exiting the scrubber of 0.004 lb/hr was rounded down by the system to zero, and the distance to endpoint was adjusted to the minimum value."
