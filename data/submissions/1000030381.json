This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. ONEOK Rockies Midstream (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees. Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures. Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies. Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Stateline Gas Plant, located near Williston, North Dakota, uses mechanical refrigeration, cryogenic extraction and fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL). As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate).  There are two 60,200 gal (198,151 lbs), eight 45,000 gal (178,165 lbs), eight 30,100 gal (141,964 lbs), and ten 19,100 gal (68,854 lbs) flammable mixture storage tanks. The Facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANAL"

      "SummaryText": "YSIS RESULTS\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the Facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 192,226 pounds of flammable mixture from the plant's largest liquid petroleum gas (LPG) storage vessel. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. The maximum distance to the L-psi endpoint for this WCS was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.50 miles. Zero public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.50 mile radius.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nStateline Gas Plant is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program regulation and also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe processes at the Stateline Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Stateline Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\nThe Stateline Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\nRelease Detection\r\nDaily operator inspection\r\nMonthly valve, seal, and flange inspecti"

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in annual plant emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other ONEOK Rockies Midstream facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which"

The overall emergency response plan for the Stateline Gas Plant is coordinated with the Williams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan. The local responders for plant emergencies are the Williston, ND Fire Department and the Williams County sheriff's department. The Stateline Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, sheriff's office). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Stateline Plant will resolve all findings from the original PHA prior to plant start-up.  Safety training will be continued for all employees."
