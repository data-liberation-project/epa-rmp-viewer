      "SummaryText": "The Canadian River Municipal Water Authority(CRMWA) supplies raw water to 11 member cities and uses chlorine to control biological activity in the aqueduct. This is done by injection at the facility.  The facility name is the Pumping Plant # 1r Chlorination Station and is located at 1 1/4 miles west of Sanford.  Approximately 8,000 lbs of chlorine in four one ton containers are stored at the site.\n\nIt is CRMWA's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices, and the training of our employees.  CRMWA is very safety conscious regarding chlorine.\n\nThe worst case scenario would occur if a 2,000 lb container were to suddenly rupture.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario would occur if a fusible plug or valve should rupture.  The vapor cloud would not reach any populated areas.  The Borger Fire Department has a \u00bfB\u00bf kit which could be used to seal the rupture.\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, CRMWA has implemented an operator training program to minimize the risk of an accidental discharge due to operator error.  The facility also has an inspection schedule to reduce the risk of a discharge due to faulty equipment.\n\nThere have been no chlorine related accidents at the facility within the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program is in the hands of the Hutchinson County Emergency Planning Committee.  They have an evacuation plan in place.\n\nThe following are planned changes to improve chlorine response safety.\n?\tSend appropriate personnel to training for chlorine operations every second year.\n?\tHave emergency response training for the people who respond to chlorine leak."
