The company creates innovative products and services that help improve the quality of life. DSM's products are being applied in a wide range of end markets and applications such as human and animal nutrition and health, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, automotive and transport, coatings, housing and electrical & electronics. The group has annual sales of approximately $10 billion and employs in the region of 26,000 people around the world. DSM ranks among the global leaders in many of its fields. DSM is headquartered in the Netherlands, with locations in Europe, Asia and the Americas.\n\n\n\nDSM's Corporate SHE Policy\n\nResponsible Care is a worldwide action program set up by the chemical industry to ensure ongoing improvement of the chemical industry's performance in the field of Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) and to promote communication on SHE matters. DSM considers proper SHE management to be a fundamental part of its operations. We have incorporated the main SHE elements in a management system that is closely linked to the Responsible Care program and is at the same time based on the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 standards. DSM's SHE policy clearly states what the company understands by safe, healthy and environmentally conscious working. Our policy objectives are:\n\n* an accident-free working environment. DSM is convinced that all accidents can be prevented.\n\n* no occupational diseases or health problems attributable to DSM's activities.\n\n* ongoing evaluation and improvement of working methods, processes, products and services to ensure that these are safe and acceptable from the point of view of employees, customers, the community and the environment.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives we have laid down a number of principles that apply throughout the DSM organization:\n\n* SHE management is just as impo"

Founded in 1962, the joint venture's first production facility was a nitrogen fertilizer complex. In 1964, Nipro, Inc., (the predecessor of today's DSM Chemicals) was organized to manufacture caprolactam, a monomer of nylon used in nylon fiber production. Subsequent expansions of DSM Chemicals resulted in two additional caprolactam plants in Augusta, in 1974 and 1976, which made DSM Chemicals the largest independent supplier of caprolactam in the U.S.  In 1999 nylon 6 production began at the DSM Augusta site. \n\nWHAT DOES DSM Chemicals MEAN TO AUGUSTA? TO GEORGIA?\n\nThe DSM Chemicals plant facilities and sales offices in Augusta mean jobs for approximately 550 persons, with a payroll in excess of $25 million and total sales in excess of $300 million, of which approximately a third are export. DCNA is actively involved with the local community participating in numerous programs, and just to list a few:  Adopt-a-School program sponsor for two area schools, Adopt-a-Road program, community blood drives, pacesetter status as a supporter of the United Way for the C.S.R.A., River Road Community Advisory Panel, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and routinely conduct an open house for local community members.\n\n  \n\nWhat is Caprolactam?\n\nCaprolactam is the primary raw material used in the production of nylon 6. At DSM's Augusta plant caprolactam is stored in heated tanks in the liquid state at a temperature of 170? F.  Molten caprolactam is shipped to domestic customers, who convert it to"

DSM also converts caprolactam to a solid-state flake.  The flake is then packaged for export sales mainly for textile applications (apparel and hosiery).\n\n\n\nOleum\n\nBasic Information\n\n* Oleum, also known as fuming sulfuric acid, is basically a clear liquid with a slight milky-gray tint and a severely irritating odor. Exposure to the liquid causes tissue destruction. Oleum is a severe fume hazard. The fumes are sulfur trioxide, are severely irritating and concentrations over 3 ppm are harmful. \n\n* Oleum is used as a sulfating agent, dehydrating agent, in dyes, in explosives, and in petroleum refining. At DSM it is used to convert our intermediate product to our final product, caprolactam. After it is neutralized with ammonia, the oleum is in turn converted to ammonium sulfate, a by-product fertilizer.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History \n\nThere were no spills or releases of oleum during the last five years.\n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n* Oleum tank fumes are vented to a scrubber that recovers the fumes.\n\n* Oleum tanks and pumps are diked to limit spills and the downwind impact of the above scenarios.\n\n* Oleum is piped to our plant from the nearby supplier, thus, eliminating the risk of spills while unloading from tanker trucks.\n\n* A spare storage tank is maintained.\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\nBasic Information\n\n* Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very strong pungent odor, that is supplied to DSM as a liquid at high pressure and low temperature via piping. Ammonia is very irritating to mucous membranes, eyes and skin. Direct contact with liquid ammonia can cause severe burns. The vapor is extremely irritating and concentrations over 200 ppm are harmful. \n\n* Ammonia is one of the most commonly used chemicals in the United States for a variety of industrial, commercial and agricultural purposes. DSM uses it as a refrigerant and "

The largest release was 1195 pounds. There were no offsite effects from these gas releases but the local emergency management agency was notified in each case.\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n* Ammonia inventory was minimized by the removal of an ammonia tank. Inventory is limited to the contents of piping from our supplier, PCS Nitrogen, located close to our plant.\n\n* A piping inspection program is utilized to monitor the condition of ammonia piping and repairs are made as determined by these inspections.\n\n\n\n\n\nAqua Ammonia\n\nBasic Information\n\n* Aqua ammonia is also known as ammonia water, ammonium hydroxide and household ammonia in very dilute solution. Aqua ammonia is a colorless liquid with a strong characteristic odor. Concentrations of solution range up to 30% ammonia in water. Like ammonia, aqua ammonia is very irritating to mucous membranes, eyes and skin. The vapor is extremely irritating and concentrations over 200 ppm are harmful. \n\n* Aqua ammonia is used for a variety of industrial, commercial, agricultural, pharmaceutical and household purposes.

Natural gas is delivered with a strong odorizer to give it a distinctive smell. Methane can be a simple asphyxiant by displacing oxygen from the atmosphere; otherwise, no acute or long term health effects are known.

Cyclohexane is very flammable in air even in small volumes. The flammable vapors are heavier than air and tend to accumulate on the ground rather than disperse. Cyclohexane is not a listed chemical subject to EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation; however, it is considered the most serious hazard in the DSM plant.\n\n* Cyclohexane is used in the manufacture of nylon, as a solvent and as a paint and varnish remover. DSM uses it as a raw material to produce caprolactam.\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\n\nThere were two spills of cyclohexane during the last five years in the amounts of 1,789 Lbs and 6,194 Lbs.  There were no offsite effects from these releases but the local emergency management agency was notified in each case.\n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n* Cyclohexane storage tank is surrounded by a containment dike or wall.\n\n* Cyclohexane storage tank is equipped with fire suppression systems.\n\n* Cyclohexane "
