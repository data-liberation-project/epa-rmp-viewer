All applicable procedures of the ANSI K61-1-1989 revision of the \"Safe Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", as adopted by the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship (IDALS) are adhered to. Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. The facility has three anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, one with 30,000 gallons water capacity, one with a capacity of 26,000 gallons of water and the last with a capacity of 12,000 gallons of water. The storage tanks, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks (45 @ 1,000 gallons each), risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all part of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation. The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenario. The first vscenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break. The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \"worst case\" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the largest tanke, releasing the entire 132,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.

The worst case scenario used EPAs recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with a \"F\" atmospheric stability class. A rural topography was selected as typical. The distance to the endpoint was 2.6 miles. It is estimated that 1,830 people would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario assumed a hose breaks and leaks 7,127 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario. Using rural topography and \"TFIs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\" the toxic endpoint is 0.46 miles. The population within that area is estimated to be 915 people. The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves and human intervention would stop the leak.\n\nFredericksburg Farmers Coop has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past 5 years. Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nFredericksburg Farmers Coop has several key elements in its accident prevention plan: 1) the anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Iowa; 2) annual training is required of all personel on handling, transferring or transporting anhydrous ammonia; the training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid and emergency response; 3) use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids; 4) frequent site inspections; 5) annual inspections by IDALS fertilizer inspectors include safety equipment, tanks and handling equipment; and 6) use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.
