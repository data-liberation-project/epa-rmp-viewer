      "SummaryText": "Regulated Substance and Stationary Source\n\n\n\nThe Grain Craft facility in Barnesville, GA is in the business of milling grains into various flours to be used in baking food products.  Wheat, by its nature, can carry a variety of bacteria and spores on its surface.  This flora can produce undesirable or harmful qualities in finished products.  Controlled introduction of chlorine gas into the flour during milling reduces the flora to acceptable levels.  Further, chlorine produces reactions in the raw flour which can be advantageous in the baking process.\n\n\n\nPressurized chlorine is stored as liquid in one ton cylinders at the mill. Chlorine is introduced into the milling system via multiple tank connections to a common manifold d to the demand rate required by the particular mill.  Chlorine is drawn through a Gas Pressure Reducing Valve and a Vacuum Regulator and Pressure Check unit, and enters the chlorinators under vacuum rather than under pressure.  This greatly reduces the probability of a leak of chlorine from the chlorine delivery piping.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this site is 8,000 pounds, which exceeds the EPA's threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Grain Craft is therefore subject to RMP requirements under CAA 112 (r).\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention of Chlorine Release\n\n\n\nThe process is designed and maintained in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices as shown in the Process Safety information that is incorporated within the Process Safety Management (PSM) document on file at the facility.  It is Grain Craft's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we operate and maintain the chlorine storage and dispensing system.  Corbion Caravan, a nationally recognized expert firm, has performed all periodic and preventive maintenance over many years, and provided frequent and thorough training to our personnel.

Program 3 includes Process Safety Management (PSM) with the following elements:\n\n\n\n-Employee Participation\n\n-Process Safety Information\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-Operating Procedures\n\n-Training\n\n-Contractors\n\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n-Mechanical Integrity\n\n-Hot Work Permits\n\n-Management of Change\n\n-Incident Investigation\n\n-Compliance Audits\n\n-Emergency Response\n\n-Trade Secrets\n\n\n\nDespite the Prevention Program noted above, incidents may still occur.  Grain Craft works with emergency responders, the Lamar County EMA, who are trained to respond to a release.  Further, in the case of a qualifying release (> 10 pounds), facility personnel are instructed to notify the National Response Center at (800) 424-8802, and the Georgia Reporting Center at (800) 241-4113."
