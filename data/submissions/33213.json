Wherever we operate, we will conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risks to drive sustainable business growth. We will not be satisfied until we succeed in eliminating all injuries, occupational illnesses, unsafe practices and incidents of environmental harm from our activities.  \n\nIn fulfilling this commitment, management will ensure systems are in place to provide the resources and training to identify issues and maintain a safe and healthful environment as indicated by Company standards, accepted safety and environmental practices, and compliance with legislative requirements.  We will operate and maintain our plants, facilities and equipment and handle our raw materials and products in a manner to prevent personal injuries/illnesses, losses to Company property, releases to the environment, or impact to the communities in which we operate.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe San Francisco Refinery, located in Rodeo, California, processes crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces gasoline, automotive diesel, butane, fuel oil and petroleum coke.  In order to produce these products, we store and handle large quantities of regulated flammable materials.  \n\nTo reduce air pollution, the Rodeo Refinery power plant is equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction devices that convert oxides of nitrogen (NOx) to harmless nitrogen and water.  These devices use a solution of ammonia in water (aqueous ammonia), a regulated substance, to perform this conversion.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has experienced one accidental releases in the past 5 years that qualify for reporting under the EPA's c"

Rodeo Refinery employees are committed to operating a safe facility through the establishment, review, and continuous improvement of these programs and practices.  \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include safety committee involvement, developing and reviewing safe operating procedures, and participation in the process hazard analysis program.   Information on the refinery's prevention programs is available to employees, and they are encouraged to recommend improvements to any of the programs.  In addition, refinery management has a strong commitment to developing and enforcing written policies and procedures and encourages employee input to identify when a policy or procedure needs to be changed or improved to cover new tasks, revised regulations, or employee experience. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains an extensive library of Process Safety Information.  This library includes information related to chemicals in the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.

The process is maintained within these limits using computer process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nInformation on the design and construction of process equipment includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that protective features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined using a technique known as process hazard analysis, or PHA.  A team of experienced operators, engineers, and other specialists conducts the analyses.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA teams recommendations are then reviewed with management personnel for resolution.  Implementation of actions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive the highest priority.  Acti"
