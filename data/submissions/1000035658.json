The facility is located in Carthage, MO which stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.  In addition to petroleum storage, Magellan stores butane onsite for blending into gasoline as well as receives propane via pipeline connection that is subsequently stored in an excavated cavern.  The propane is loaded onto transport trucks for sale and distribution.  Both butane and propane require compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations since the onsite storage is greater than 10,000 lbs for each substance.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances at this facility are both butane and propane. The equipment which handles butane include four pressure vessels and associated piping and may contain a maximum of 608,638 lbs without considering engineering and administrative controls. The equipment which handles propane include an excavated cavern, drying process, pressure vessel, and associated piping and may contain a maximum of 25,223,535 lbs. with engineering controls taken into account on the cavern.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe Carthage Facility has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the company's policy to notify the Jasper County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\n\nThe regulated butane storage/blending and propane storage processes in the facility are compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and "

The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nUnder the RMP rule, the Carthage Facility is required to report an incident that occurred onsite June 29, 2012.  Though there was no offsite impact, the local LEPC was called to respond to a process heater fire which was a result of a tube rupture in the direct fired heater.  The fired heater is used in the dehydration process of the propane and aids in regenerating the water saturated catalyst.  The local LEPC responded to the heater fire by aiding in isolating process valves which allowed the fire to burn out.\n\n\n\nDue to the fire, Magellan has upgraded the process heater, process controls and shutdown sequences, and has improved the preventative maintenance program to prevent an incident reoccurring in the future. The installation of the new process heater and controls resulted in performing a new PHA which resulted in submitting a new RMP.  Magellan is dedication to improving process safety and continually looks for opportunities to improvement.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  Within the past five years the butane storage and blending process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  The propane storage and dryer process has had an incident which resulted in contactin"
