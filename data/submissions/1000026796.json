This record refers to the Ammonia production unit.  Each unit (and Prevention Program) has elements that are specific to that unit. They are: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance (Mechanical Integrity), Management of Change, and Pre-Startup Safety Review. Those elements implemented on a plant-wide basis include: Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation Plan, Hot Work Permits, Contractor Safety Procedures and Contractor Safety Evaluation.  The information submitted in this RMP for the latter elements is the same for all units.",

KNC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  Ammonia is also injected into an ammonia pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  Carbon dioxide, a by-product of the ammonia manufacturing process, is sold to third party entities, liquefied in the facility's CO2 plant and sold, used in the UAN plant, or vented to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantit"

The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 Prevention Program requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n?    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped minimize the severity of chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\n?    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) in place.\n\n?    Providing a low-amp trip system to shut down ammonia loading pumps during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia.\n\n?    Installing chlorine detectors to help ensure that a chlorine release"

Installing ammonia detectors to help ensure that an ammonia release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\n?    Installing low-pressure trip switches on ammonia loading hoses to stop product transfer in the event of a hose rupture.\n\n?    Requiring personnel protective equipment at all loading areas and emergency equipment in control rooms and throughout the plant.\n\n?    Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n\n?    Equipping the rail loading scale with an automatic shutdown that will prohibit further product movement upon reaching the weight of a full railcar.  \n\n?    Requiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnected.\n\n?    Providing level indications on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\n\n?    Providing a fire water system to help with vapor control in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release.\n\n?    Installing cameras at the gate and process areas for early detection of upsets.\n\n\n\n    \n\n    Five-Year Accident History\n\n    \n\n    Within the last five years, the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant has experienced three incidents reportable in the five-year accident history of the RMP regulation.  The first incident occurred on January 9, 2008 and resulted in injuries that required medical treatment.  The second incident occurred on October 1, 2008 and resulted in the evacuation of employees from a nearby industrial facility.  The third incident occurred on August 22, 2010 and resulted in injuries that required medical treatment as well as significant onsite property damage.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Emergency Response Program\n\n    \n\n    The facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any necessary emergency response actions with the Beatrice Rural Fire Department and the Gage County Sheriff Department.

The Beatrice Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    \n\n    Compliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n    \n\n?    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\n?    An ongoing dialogue with the Gage County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.  \n\n\n\n"
