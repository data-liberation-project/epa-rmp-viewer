              "Description": "The Cheese Protien Internation LLC facility contains 1 refrigeration system process which uses Anhydrous Ammonia. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in the process is 35,000 pounds. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a vapor compression system which consists of four basic components; the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator.  The cycle involves two pressures, high and low, which enables the system to produce a continuous cooling effect.  Low pressure vapor is compressed, raising temperatures and pressure levels.  During compression, heat of compression is added to the vapor as the pressure is raised.  At the condenser, the high pressure vapor is liquefied by cooling.  The liquid ammonia flows from the condenser to an expansion valve where its pressure and temperature are reduced.  The ammonia moves to the evaporator where it absorbs heat from the media being cooled.  Vaporized ammonia then flows to the compressor suction to complete the refrigeration cycle.\n \nThe ammonia vapors from the evapoatros flow through a liquid accumulator where any entrained liquids are knocked out of the gas stream prior to being compressed.  This prevents damage to the compressors.  The accumulated liquids are transfered back to the receiver.\n\nThe Cheese Protein International LLC refrigeration system is a closed loop system and designed to run continuously.  When required, the refrigeration system is recharged with ammonia by off-loaded bulk ammonia to the ammonia receiver.  Ammonia is off-loaded through the tanker's flexible hose connected to the receiver's hard piped charge line.  Recharging only occurs when there has been a loss of ammonia from the system.  Under normal operation, these losses result from fugitive sources (i.e., pump seals, valves, flanges) and from routine maintenance of equipment.\n\nPiping and Instrumentation Diagrams;\n \nComprehensive and up to date piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system are maintained by the Plant Engineer.  \n\nVentilation System Design;\n\nThe facility has one ammonia refrigeration engine room.  The engine room ventilation system consists of three air intake areas and three exhaust fans.   One exhaust fan in the engine room is run continuously. When ammonia is detected at a concentration of 300 PPM the detector automatically activates the emergency ventilation exhaust fans. The ventilation system design data is maintained by the Plant Engineer.\n\nSafety Systems;\n\nAmmonia sensors and control panels are installed in the engine room and automatically activate the ventilation system and audible /visual alarms inside and outside the engine room. A sail switch is provided on the engine rooms continuous exhaust fan.  If the fan fails to operate properly, the sail switch activates an audible/visual alarm inside and outside the engine room.\n\nSafety systems design data are maintained by the Plant Engineer.\n\nInformation Pertaining to the Hazards of Ammonia are contained in the MSDS for anhydrous ammonia.  The MSDS meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200 (g).  This information is also provided as part of each Maintenance Departments Ammonia Refrigeration System Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Manual.\n\nMaterials of Construction;\n\nInformation on the materials of construction is provided in the facility refrigeration system specifications and on construction drawings maintained by the Plant Engineer.  \n\nElectrical Classification;\n\nThe engine room and plant are not managed as classified areas.  The engine rooms has a ventilation system that meet current ASHRAE ventilation standards, which exempts the engine rooms from being operated as a classified area. Ventilation system design data is maintained by the Plant Engineer.\n\nMaterial and Energy Balances;\n\nMaterial and energy balances have been developed for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system and are maintained by the Plant Engineer.\n\nRelief System Design;\n\nThe facilities refrigeration system anhydrous ammonia relief system is designed in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE standard 15-2001 specifications and are contained on construction drawings maintained by the Plant Engineer.  \n \nDesign Codes and Standards;\n\n2001 Uniform Mechanical Code; Chapter 15, Mechanical Refrigeration Equipment\n\n1988 Uniform Fire Code; Article 63, Mechanical Refrigeration Article 80, Hazardous Materials\n\nASME/ANSI B31.3-1999 Edition; Process Piping\n\nASME B31.3 - 1999 Edition; 345 Testing\n\nANSI/ASHRAE 15 ?2001; Safety Standard for Mechanical Refrigeration\n\nANSI/IIAR2 ? 1999; Equipment Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical \nRefrigerating Systems\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. R1-1983; Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia \nRefrigeration System\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 107 ? 1997; Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When \nMaking Ammonia Refrigeration Plant Tie-Ins\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 108; Water Contamination in Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 109 ? 1997; IIAR Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe \nAmmonia Refrigeration System\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 111 ? 1991; Ammonia Machinery Room Ventilation\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 112 ? 1998; Ammonia Machinery Room Design\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 114 ? 1991; Identification of Ammonia Refrigeration Piping and System Components\n\nIIAR Bulletin No. 116 ? 1992; Avoiding Component Failure in Industrial \nRefrigeration Systems Caused by Abnormal Pressure or Shock\n\nCCR, Title 8, Section 458 ?

The potential hazards associated with this operation have been identified through a formal process hazard assessment and any action items will be addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures;\n\nWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) for the faciliy's anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process have been developed in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119). The facilities SOP's provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the covered process, consistent with the process safety information. The operating  procedures include the following information:  \n\n? Steps involved in initial startup; startup after an emergency shutdown or turnaround; normal operations; temporary operations; normal shutdown; and emergency operations and shutdown procedures, including the condition under which shut down is required and the assignment of emergency shutdown responsibilities to qualified personnel.\n\n? Process conditions and operating steps necessary for safe operation.  \n\n? Consequences of deviations and responses to correct or avoid deviations from the process limits for safe operation.  \n\n? Release information, such as the properties and hazards of materials used in the process, precautions to prevent exposures, remedial actions for a release, any special or unique hazards, and procedures for quality control of raw materials and hazardous chemical inventories.  \n\n? Functions of safety systems.  \n\n? Safe work practices, for activities such as lockout/tagout, confined-space entry, line breaking and vessel opening, and control over personnel entering and exiting a facility.  \n\nThe operating procedures are readily accessible to the operators and are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they remain current.  The accuracy of the procedure is certified annually. \n \nMechanical Integrity;\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to ensure the mechanical integrity of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process equipment, including pressure vessels, storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, alarms, and interlocks.  These procedures include the following:\n\n? Tests and inspections to be performed and their frequency;\n\n? Training for maintenance personnel in the above-described procedures and an overview of the process and its hazards;\n\n? Test and inspection documentation, including the date of the test or inspection, the name of the person performing the task, the identity of the equipment, the task performed, and the results of the test or inspection;\n\n? Procedures for correcting deficiencies either:  (1) before further use of the equipment, or (2) in a timely manner when precautions are taken to ensure continued safe operation; and \n\n? Quality control procedures to ensure maintenance equipment, materials, and spare parts meet design specifications and are properly utilized.\n\nThe tests, inspections, and their frequency are based on manufacturers recommendations, codes and standards, or good engineering practice.\nPresently, the following maintenance activities are conducted:\n\n? The system performance is reviewed during each operating shift and system parameters are logged.  Maintenance personnel walk through the facility three times daily to visually inspect the system.  If anything unusual is noted it is either immediately repaired, or a work order is generated to initiate the repair or modifications.\n\n? Any unusual performance or ammonia odors are promptly investigated by maintenance personnel.  \n\n? Parts are only replaced with their identical components unless authorization is given by the Plant Engineer and a Management of Change form is completed.  \n\n? Copies of equipment information are kept in the Maintenance office.  \n\n? Associates involved in the PM program are trained in the anhydrous ammonia processes and hazards.  The maintenance staff is trained by more experienced staff that is qualified in the maintenance and operation of the equipment.\n\n? Deficiencies are corrected as required to maintain a safe working environment.  Maintenance materials, spare parts, and equipment have been reviewed for compatibility with the anhydrous ammonia processes.\n\n? The facility is insured for fire.  The fire protection system including fire extinguishers are inspected each year.  The boilers are insured and inspected annually by an outside contractor.  Pressure vessels are inspected annually by the insurer.\n\nEquipment maintenance records are kept in the maintenance office.  The records are kept indefinitely.  \n\nAccess Control Procedures;\n\nThe Facility is fenced and gated, access is restricted to authorized personnel only by a manned 24 hour guard. Exterior doors to the engine room are locked.\n\nContractors;\n\nThe management of contractors working within the facility is a significant part of the prevention program.  The facility has a comprehensive contractor management program.  The contractor management program begins with an initial screening of the contractor.  Then, maintenance management personnel are assigned to oversee each aspect of contractor management.  The following elements summarize the main points of the facility's contractor management program:\n\nAll contractors must supply required information to complete the facilities Contractor Pre-Qualification Checklist prior to being approved for work.\n\nAll ammonia refrigeration contractors are assigned an internal manager.\n\nContractors are required to check in each day.\n\nContractors are required to follow all facility environmental, health, and safety rules or are subject to dismissal.  Each contract work area is monitored periodically for health and safety compliance by the area supervisor.  \n\nContractor is escorted to work area the first day and monitored by Dairyman's staff throughout the project.\n\nPeriodically during large projects, or at the conclusion of smaller ones, each contractor is evaluated (using a Contractor Safety Performance Evaluation Form) for compliance with safety requirements.  Based upon this performance assessment, a decision is made as to whether the contractor will be permitted to remain on the bid list.\n\nAll contract employees working on the anhydrous ammonia system receive a comprehensive site orientation session covering topics contained in the Contractor Orientation Checklist.  \n\nAll hazardous work performed by the contractor requiring the completion of permits (e.g., hot work, lockout /tagout, etc.) is conducted in accordance with the facility procedures.  \n\nContractors must make a verbal report by the end of the shift, and produce a written report to the Facility Safety Manager of any injuries; vehicle incidents; and incidents involving damage to property, spills, fires, theft, or loss of equipment, prior to the end of the next working day.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews;\n\nThe facility conducts pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs) on any new or modified equipment at the facility to confirm that the as-built installation meets the design specifications. That adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that operators are trained in these procedures before starting of the equipment.\n\n\nManagement of Change Procedures;\n\nThe facility has developed modification control procedures to be used when the technical basis of a design and/or the equipment design basis changes.  These procedures apply to any additions, deletions, or modifications to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and operating procedures.  However, these procedures do not apply to replacements in kind (RIK).  \n\nThe modification control procedures ensure and document that the following issues are addressed prior to making any change:  \n\nThe technical basis of the proposed change,\n\nAny related safety and health considerations,\n\nAny necessary operating procedure modifications,\n\nThe necessary time period for making the proposed change, and \n\nRequired authorizations for the proposed changes.\n\nAll personnel affected by the change, including contract employees, must be trained in and informed of the change before the implementation of the change.  For changes involving operating procedures and process safety information, the procedures and process safety information must be updated. \n\nHot Work Program;\n\nThis facility has developed a system for issuing permits for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process (e.g., process involving anhydrous ammonia).  The permit (1) documents compliance with OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements, which are presented in 29 CFR 1910.252(a); (2) identifies the time period authorized for hot work; and (3) identifies the equipment on which the hot work is to be performed.  The permit must be issued before the start of the hot work and must be kept at the site where the hot work will be performed. \n\nFacility Permit System;\n\nHot work is any activity within an area that could potentially produce a spark or involve an open flame.  The Hot Work Policy and Permit System  outlines the requirements and responsibilities associated with conducting hot work at the facility.  The facility maintains an effective hot work permit procedure as part of an overall hot work system.  The written program for hot work contains the following:\n  \nThe Plant Engineer, Maintenance Manager/Foreman, Production Supervisor, PSM Coordinator or the EHS are qualified to authorize the performance of hot work.\n\nA list of locations where hot work permits are required (or hot work permits are not required). \n\nA training program for associates designated to authorize hot work (e.g., maintenance and operating personnel).  This training program includes specific instructions on:\n\nThe types of hazards to look for, precautions that can be taken, and locations and situations in which hot work is prohibited; \n\nThe use, calibration, and limitation of lower explosive limit (LEL) monitoring equipment; \n\nWhen cutting and welding is permitted;\n\nLocation of fire safe areas;\n\nSafeguards used while cutting, welding and using open flame;\n\nProper use of fire extinguisher;\n\nUnderstanding of inspection area before and after work completed;\n\nMaintenance of cutting and welding equipment;\n\nUse of Permit; and\n\nUse of combustible gas detection instruments.\n\nHot work permit applications are available in the maintenance shop.  Approved and/or completed hot work permits are maintained in the office of the Maintenance Manager for one year after the job has been completed.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nCheese Protein International LLC incident investigation procedures have been developed to investigate catastrophic releases of a highly hazardous chemical in the workplace or situations that could have resulted in such a catastrophic release.  These procedures include the following required activities:  \n\nInitiate the investigation as soon as possible and no later than within 48 hours of the incident.\n\nEstablish an incident investigation team that includes:  (1) at least one person knowledgeable about the subject process; (2) other individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly analyze and investigate the incident; and (3) a contract employee, if the incident involved a contractor.\n\nPrepare an incident report for each incident.  This report must include:  \n\nThe date of the incident,\n\nThe date the investigation began,\n\nA description of the incident,\n\nA description of the  contributing factors, and \n\nAny recommendations resulting from the investigation.  \n\nEstablish a system for resolving the recommendations of the incident investigation team and documenting any resolutions adopted or corrective actions taken.  \n\nReview the report with all affected personnel, including contract employees.  \n\nAll incident investigation reports must be retained for five years.  \n\nFacility Program;\n\nAn incident is defined as any unplanned event resulting in or that could have resulted in a spill or release of anhydrous ammonia.  The management elements of the facility program include the following: \n\nAll process incidents are formally and promptly investigated.  Each incident is a learning experience that may result in changes in standard operating procedures (SOPs), process safety information, and training programs.  \n\nAll incident investigation reports include a means of preventing future occurrence of the incident, and a written follow-up report is prepared.  \n\nAll incident investigation reports are disseminated to those who work in or near the incident area, and are reviewed during safety training classes and safety meetings.  \n\nResponsibilities;\n\nThe PSM Coordinator is responsible for organizing an incident investigation team and conducting the initial meeting.

      "SummaryText": "1.0    SOURCE\n\nThe Cheese Protein International (CPI) facility located in Tulare, California is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulations (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for cheese and curd processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 35,000 pounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor). \n\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119).The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n1.  The development of an employee participation program, which includes facility employees from all areas within the plant.\n\n2.  The development, documentation, and availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment. This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n3.  The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the ammonia refrigeration system using a \"What-If\" Protection Analysis. A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the  safety and operability of the system.  The PHA is updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n4.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe "

      "SummaryText": "safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n5.  Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n6.  Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based on their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  In addition, these contractors are periodically evaluated to ensure that they continue to work safely.  All contractor work is overseen by CPI personnel.\n\n7.  A preventative maintenance program is in place at the Tulare facility.  This includes regular inspection of major powered equipment, including compressors,  pumps and large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, mountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure, and regular inspection and calibration of  liquid level sensors, temperature and pressure instruments, switches and shutdown devices that have safety implications.\n\n8.  Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n\n9.  Events that might cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as "

      "SummaryText": "to prevent recurrence.\n\n10. Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\n\n11. Planning with the Tulare Fire Department to ensure a rapid response to potential incidents with the system or external events, such as earthquakes or tornadoes.\n\n12. Adherence to fire codes and preparation for fires, storms, earthquakes, or other events that could impact the ammonia system.\n\n13. Prevention program compliance audits performed every three years to verify that the appropriate management systems are in place and are being properly implemented.  Any deficiency found in an audit is corrected.\n\n3.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n4.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Tulare facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.  The plan has been reviewed to assure:\n\nThat the Tulare facility is included in the written community ERP; Specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances are included; That it includes procedures for the public and  local agencies responding to an accidental release; and that it includes information on emergency health care."
