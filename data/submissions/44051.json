      "SummaryText": "The primary purpose of the Hot Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant is to treat wastewater and return it to the environment.  Parts of this process utilize chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in individual one-ton cylinders and stored until needed.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are injected into the wastewater treatment system by automatic feeders.  The feed system uses a vacuum ?shut-off? system which is designed to automatically shut the system down if a leak occurs.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored at the facility is 16,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility is 16,000 pounds. \n\nThe prevention of unnecessary human exposure reduces the threat to the health and safety of employees as well as to nearby members of the community.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThis wastewater treatment facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State of Arkansas codes and regulations.  Furthermore, the facility has stringent guidelines and practices for day to day procedures involving the chemicals.  These procedures have been updated to include recommendations by the EPA, such as ?Consequences of Deviation.?\n\nThe Emergency Response Program was developed for the City of Hot Springs and the surrounding areas with the assistance of Affiliated Engineers, Inc.  This program has been discussed with the Arkansas Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Hot Springs Fire Department.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the appropriate agencies and potentially affected members of the community.  In addition, it provides procedures for mitigating any releases that may cause harm to the community.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were examined for this facility using RMP Comp.  The population data used was determined by performing a house co"

The remaining details and results of these calculations are included in the electronically submitted data. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program consists primarily of education and training programs.  All employees are trained in proper operational methods and practices.  For example, chemical release is prevented by implementing such practices as daily maintenance checks of all chlorination and dechlorination equipment.\n\nThere has been one accidental release of chlorine on March 30, 2005.  The release was less than one pound with duration of 10 seconds.  One worker suffered very minor injuries and was taken to the hospital, where he was treated and released.  There have been no other accidental releases of chlorine of sulfur dioxide in the last five years."
