      "SummaryText": "The South Meridian Water Treatment Plant is located south east of downtown Meridian.  It is  a Class B groundwater treatment plant.  This site stores less than 20,000 pounds of chlorine in a three sided brick constructed building.  The building is equipped with a chlorine leak detection system that gives visual and audio warning at the detection of 1PPM chlorine gas released into the atmosphere.  This building is located north of the main entrance gate.  The Meridian Fire Department (Class 4) and the Lauderdale County Emergency Management Agency are equipped to respond to chemical emergencies at this facility.  This facility has eleven full-time employees.  This plant has an operator on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  We have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.  This is largely contributed to practicing safety when changing out chlorine tanks. This plant has an annual safety budget that is used to purchase safety equipment and provide safety training. All operators are trained on the dangers of chlorine gas and on what to do in case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nOur worst case scenario involves off loading the delivery truck and dropping a one ton cylinder on the end caps. The weight of the cylinder pushes the end caps it the connection valves and they snap. This causes the cylinder to leak profusely. The release rate in this scenario would be 200 lb/minute for ten minutes. There would be no way to contain a leak in this scenario.  An accident of this magnitude at this plant, would cause us to evacuate schools, hospitals, residents, prisons, recreation areas and major industrial areas.  A more likely scenario would involve the vacuum regulator leaking at the tank connection.  This would be detected by the leak detection system and can be contained by closing the cylinder valves. No evacuation would be nessary in this scenario."
