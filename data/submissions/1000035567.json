The Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance which led to off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor, and the Facility coordinates emergency response procedures with the local fire department.  Therefore, the Plaquemine Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \r\n\r\nThe Plaquemine Plant employs twenty-one (21) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \r\n\r\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P.
