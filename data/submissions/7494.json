Its procedures follow the guidance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program.\n\nThe Morgantown Utility Board Water Treatment Plant currently serves approximately 20,000 customers and an additional 8 Resale Customers (Public Service Districts, Water Associations, Etc..)   The plant draws most of its water from the Monongahela River and treats approximately 8.4 million gallons of water per day.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release scenario.\"   The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.   The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"\n\nThe \"worst case release scenario\" involves two nearly empty one ton cylinders (less than 500 lbs each) thata are each respectively manifolded to full one ton cylinders when an accident occurs, causing all four cyliders to release their contents.   This maximum quantity of 5000 lbs is ensured by strict adherence to the practice of connecting a full cylinder to the manifolds only after the corresponding active cylinder contents has been depleted to 500 lbs or less\n\nThe \"alternative release scenario\" involves a single one ton cylinder having an automatic shut-off valve failure combined with a line breakage.   The RMP Comp program was used to define the distance to the toxic endpoint.   Additional active mitigation measures taken include replacement or the existing chlorinators to a remote vacuum type, with all pressurized chlorine piping replaced with vacuum piping.   This will further reduce the amount of chloringe released in case of "
