LSCP started operations in March of 2003.  At that time, LSCP submitted and RMP for the facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.  At that time many of the reports and information were developed and underwent constant review and revision prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is \"new\" and therefore, the \"new\" management was implemented with the construction and start of the facility. \n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P.  is designed to produce approximately 40 million gallons of fuel grade ethanol per year.  DDGS and wet cake are by-products of ethanol production and are sold to local cattle markets as animal feed.  Ethanol production activities fall under the SIC code of2869, Industrial Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  Training personnel is also important to the facility and is considered a valuable prevention method.  Staff is trained on spill prevention and control methods as well as emergency response policies which are implemented at the facility.\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  LSCP management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and emergency response.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. e"

LSCP is located in the North ? of the NE ?, Section 2, Township 92 North, Range 42 West, bounded on the North by 480th Street, east by F Ave., west by undeveloped land and south by a rail line.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant which is considered a flammable mixture.  Ammonia is used as a chemical processing aid and is consumed in the manufacturing process.  Natural Gasoline is used to denature the ethanol so it is impure prior to being shipped off-site in accordance with applicable regulations.  Denaturant is generally stored on-site in the denaturant and final product storage tanks.  The maximum capacity of onsite denaturant storage is about 380,800 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored on-site in an above ground storage tank, which can hold approximately 97,200 pounds of ammonia.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. has constructed an ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite.  To date, LSCP has not had a spill of reportable quantities that has been released to land or water.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.P.'s corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nSafety inspection are conducted by plant personnel as a daily routine.

Our emergency response plan has been filed with the local fire department, area response personnel, State Fire Marshalls office and appropriate law enforcement agencies.  We have conducted SPCC training and site security training to formalize employees of the requirements.  We have conducted mock drills to give each employee the opportunity to realize their role in the event an emergency occurs.
