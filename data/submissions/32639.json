Natural Gasoline is used to denature the ethanol so it is impure prior to being shipped off-site in accordance with applicable regulations.  Denaturant is generally stored on-site in the denaturant and final product storage tanks.  The maximum capacity of onsite denaturant storage is about 380,800 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored on-site in an above ground storage tank, which can hold approximately 97,200 pounds of ammonia.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. has constructed an ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite.
