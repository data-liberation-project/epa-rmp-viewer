The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce bedding, furniture, and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam and carpet pad.  TDI is received by rail car and by tank truck, and is stored in outdoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is a"

      "SummaryText": "bout 1,750,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam is conveyed to a warehouse where it is cured, then transferred to cutting stations where it is cut to the size and shape specified by our customers.\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA??A?s risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceed EPA??A?s threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst-case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nFoamex Innovations Cornelius, NC PlantRMP Executive Summary May 28, 2009 Page 2\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n??A?    Most people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA??A?s Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.

Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n??A?    Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment\n??A?    Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedure\n??A?    Create, maintain and evaluate operating procedures for processes that use regulated substances\n??A?    Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs\n??A?    Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes\n??A?    Confirm through compliance audits that RMP practices at the plant are consistent with our written programs and that the programs are adequate to address all of the requirements of the RMP rule\n??A?    Ensure that process incidents, particularly those of catastrophic magnitude or potential, are thoroughly investigated using our incident investigation procedures and that relevant findings are communicated throughout the company to help prevent recurrence\n  \nThe TDI process at our plant has hazards that are carefully managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and by management system failures.\nIn addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release."
