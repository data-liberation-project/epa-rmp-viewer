Specifically, Rubicon is located on Highway 75 about 1 mile south of the intersection of Highway 75 and Highway 73.  Rubicon employs over 700 people including contract workers and produces chemicals that produce two main products: 1. Polyurethanes and 2. Rubber Chemical Additives.  These products have a wide variety of commercial uses including automotive, building materials, appliances, footwear, and sporting goods.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nDuring the past five years, Rubicon has not had a release from a covered process which resulted in a death, an injury, or significant property damage on site, or a known offsite death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nRubicon's emergency response program is based on the philosophy of prevention, preparation and response.  Some practices at Rubicon for preventing situations that could possibly lead to a emergency incident are the use of good engineering design and standards, conducting hazard studies, safety procedures, unit operations policies and procedures, continuous process control and monitoring, and inspection and testing.  The second and third elements of Rubicon emergency response program ares preparation and response.  Practices at Rubicon for preparing for emergency situations includes the training of the internal emergency response units which includes exercises and drills.  These units are the Fire Brigade, HAZMAT personnel with equipped van, medical first responders with equipped ambulance and a first aid station with nurse, and teams specializing in vertical and confined space rescues.  \r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of preparation for an emergency is communication.  Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: 888 emergency notification telephone system, two way radios, public announcement system in the Un"

External communications systems include the tie lines with neighboring chemical plants, 888 phone system, Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) radio, the telephone system with backup, cellular phones, and the use of 911.  When Rubicon dials 911, the community sirens that can be heard over 40 miles, the Community Alert Network (CAN) telephone message system that covers a 2.5-mile radius, and/or local television and radio broadcasts can be activated.  These external communication systems inform and coordinate efforts with our closest chemical plant neighbors, the Ascension Parish Sheriff, Office of Emergency Preparedness, the State Police and/or the general public.\r\n\r\nRubicon also works closely with outside authorities and other neighboring companies to coordinate emergency response.  These authorities are Louisiana State Police, Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness, Geismar Fire Department, Prairieville Fire Department, Red Cross, St. Elizabeth Hospital (Gonzales), Our Lady of the Lake Regional Hospital (Baton Rouge), Baton Rouge General Medical Center (Baton Rouge), Summit Hospital (Baton Rouge) and the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA).  GAMA also has reciprocal agreements for equipment exchange with the St. James Mutual Aid and Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid Systems.  In most cases, Rubicon performs annual training with these organizations or provides information about Rubicon that is necessary for coordinated emergency response.\r\n\r\nRubicon has also developed formal emergency action plans such as the SPC/SPCC Plan, RCRA Contingency Plan, and the One Plan for emergency situations.  Rubicon also has emergency internal procedures such as Policy for Emergency Action, Procedure for Emergency Brigade, 888 Emergency Phone System, Procedure for Radiation Sources, Evacuation Procedure, Bomb Threat Procedure, and Hurricane Procedure.

Other response practices not previously explained include utilizing wind socks to determine wind direction, a Safer System for dispersion modeling of gas release, monitoring on-site and off-site by HAZMAT response personnel, the phosgene detection monitoring system for air intakes, water curtains for air releases, equipment and/or unit shutdown(s) and waste handling procedures.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRubicon's current philosophy on major safety improvements is to evaluate the use of pipelines in place of tank trucks or rail cars for transportation of chemicals. Switching to pipelines allows Rubicon to reduce storage of these chemicals and it promotes less handling of these chemicals through less loading and unloading.  Pipelines also benefit the public because there is less transportation of these chemicals through their neighborhoods thus lowering the possibility of accidents. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that Rubicon already conducts our business safely and effectively which is demonstrated by our outstanding safety record.  Rubicon has, for the last 37 years effectively managed our systems to minimize risk to our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Rubicon is committed to maintaining this high standard of performance and plans to enjoy many more safe, productive years in this area. \r\nRubicon applied for OSHA VPP Star Status in December 2002.  Rubicon is a good company and an excellent neighbor.  Rubicon will continue to strive towards improving the safety of our facility for our employees, our near neighbors, and our community."
