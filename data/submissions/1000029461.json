An RMP comprises several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that the facility uses in combination to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the surrounding community. The RMP includes the following information:\n\n- Introduction;\n\n- Facility identification, regulated substances, and covered processes;\n\n- Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n- Hazard Assessment;\n\n- Prevention Program;\n\n- Five-Year Accident History;\n\n- Emergency Response Plan; and\n\n- Planned Changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals (KMLT) Chicago terminal, located south of the city within the Illinois International Port District, stores a material containing n-pentane in an amount greater than the threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nThe KMLT Chicago Terminal is a public \"for-hire\" bulk liquid storage terminal, approximately 178 acres in area and located approximately 19 miles south of Chicago, Illinois. The terminal is bounded by the Calumet River to the west and south, and the Illinois International Port on the north and east. Chicago Fire Department Engine 80 is located within 6 miles of the facility. The terminal provides tank storage for liquid chemicals, food grade products, and deicer products on a \"contract\" basis. Presently, approximately 86 permitted aboveground storage tanks are available (approximately 32,000,000-gallon capacity) for storage and distribution of customer products or for support activities. Materials are received at the terminal by tank trucks, rail cars, barge, and p"

Tank 3210 has a maximum capacity of 11,389 gallons and Tank 3310 has a maximum capacity of 20,079 gallons of the material blend. The tanks are completely independent, meaning they are not piped together, and may not be storing the chemical blend containing n-pentane at the same time.\n\n\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at the Chicago Terminal. This RMP formalizes and documents these activities. The facility is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements (40 CFR 68). This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount. The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n- Keeping process safety information accessible at all times.\n\n- Conducting a hazard review as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\n\n- Using written operating procedures to train and guide operators.\n\n- Providing training to all employees that operate the system.\n\n- Operating a program to properly maintain the system and equipment.\n\n- Investigating incidents and taking actions as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\n- Conducting routine audits to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n\n\nProcesses at the facility subject to the Risk Management Program are designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of a hazardous material. Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak "

In addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety. The facility also has implemented a maintenance program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, the Chicago Terminal has developed an emergency response action plan (ERAP) providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire at the facility. In the event of a release, the facility calls the Chicago Fire Department located within the Illinois International Port District.\n\n\n\nHazard Evaluation\n\nUnder the EPA regulations, the facility is required to evaluate the potential consequences of a worst case release and various alternate release scenarios. The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst case and alternate scenarios for the base.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Sections 68.22 (a)\" (40 CFR 68.3). The worst-case release scenario for toxic liquids assumes that the total quantity in a vessel is spilled instantaneously onto a flat non-absorbing surface to form a pool. Passive mitigation systems, such as dikes, are taken into account in the consequence analysis. The release rate to air is estimated as the rate of evaporation from the pool of spilled flammable liquid.\n\n \n\nRMP regulations require one worst-case sceanrio for each regulated material. To truly assume the worst-case, this scenario is created for the larger of the two tanks subject to the rule, and assumed to contain pure n-pentane. For Tank 3310 (capacity 20,079 gallons), it is assumed that the contents of the tank empty instantaneously to"

The evaporation rate is then determined using the U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp program to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nKMLT reported that no accidents had occurred during the previous five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)). Emergency response activities at the Chicago Terminal are coordinated with the Cook County Central LEPC, Illinois International Port, U.S. Coast Guard, and Chicago Fire Department.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of the facility's activities. Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections, maintenance, and capital improvements. Further improvements will continue to be implemented as appropriate.\n\n"
