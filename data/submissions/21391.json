If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any releases to residents and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the wholesaling of grains and the operation of a country grain elevator.  Bruning Grain & Feed has operatedd this facility for over 13 years.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia store at this location is 52,000 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternativae Release Scenario:\n\n    a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the total release of the anhydrous ammonia from our major storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint would be 2.6 miles.\n\n    b.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  the distance to the endpoint would be approximately 0.3 mils.\n\n    c.  Administrative controls are through our operating procedures, training, maintenance and audit programs.\n\n4.  Accideental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of f\"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61, published by the american National Standards Institure, Inc.  During periods of non operating local law enforcement personnel and our personnel make unscheduled inspections of the facility.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the fast five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facidlity, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelterin in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.
