In addition, all pressure-rated vessels are equipped with mechanical pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation to ensure the integrity of the vessel and associated piping is protected.  Any ammonia that vents from a pressure relief valve is neutralized in the Water Diffusion Tank.\n\nMuch of the safety of the refrigeration system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  In addition to routine patrols and inspections at the facility by the security company, the facility has Maintenance / Refrigeration personnel on-site 24/7 who monitor for any abnormal conditions.  The Ruiz Food Products ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with the recognized industry codes and standards, which specifically detail requirements for safety features.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the system are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to the refrigerant in a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks / unanticipated ammonia odors are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA\u0092s RMP regulation defines \u0093accident\u0094 as the following: \n\n\u0093The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantit"

These programs enable our facility to operate the refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the broader ammonia refrigeration industry throughout the country.

To help coordinate the various elements of the program, a management system has been established that defines responsible parties for the facility to ensure upkeep and implementation of each policy within the RMP and PSM programs.

The area to the northeast of the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial and residential zones, and the land to the southwest of the facility is mostly rural farmland.\n\nThe regulated substance onsite at Ruiz Food Products is anhydrous ammonia with a maximum intended inventory of approximately 75,000 pounds.   The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed-loop cycle with no planned or anticipated emissions of ammonia, and is used for refrigeration associated with the production and cold storage of Mexican food products.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected and maintained on a regular schedule in accordance with manufacturer and industry recommendations.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the plant operates continuously based on operational + temperature demands.
