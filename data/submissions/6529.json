FMC employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is an approximately 15 acre grain elevator and fertilizer plant which is bordered by urban areas to the west, north, and northeast.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and distributed as fertilizer to our farmer-customers.  The maximum quantity stored at any time is 140,196 lbs. or 25,500 gal.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 1.16 miles from the tank.  Due to the location of the tank there would be a significant impact to surrounding areas.\n\nAs an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 0.56 miles from the tank.  Most of Medaryville would be included in this area.\n\nFMC has instituted procedures for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana State Chemist.\n\nThere has not been a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the past 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is in place, and all current personnel have been trained in the procedures.  New hires who will be working with anhydrous ammonia will be trained also.  The Emergency Response Plan will be updated as needed.  The local emergency response personnel have been trained in the proper methods of responding to an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\nIt is the policy of FMC to remain proactive in the area of accident prevention and minimization of loss in the event of a release.  We will continue to conduct self audits and compliance inspections of equipment and procedures of a regular basis.  Through our inspection process and insistence of maint"
