The amount is greater than the listed threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds for aqua ammonia established in 40 CFR 68.130.  Since the aqua ammonia does not exceed the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)-listed minimum concentration of 44% and the facility is not one of the listed NAICS codes per 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1), the process could potentially be eligible for RMP Program 2.  However, since Ennis-Flint complies with RMP Program 3 and the OSHA PSM standard other processes at their facilities, Ennis-Flint has voluntarily opted to comply with the Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D for the aqua ammonia process.

Employees of the facility are trained in their roles and responsibilities in implementing prevention and emergency response.  Should an emergency occur, Ennis-Flint will follow the Contingency Plan.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:  Aqua ammonia is stored in a bulk tank at the facility.  Aqua ammonia is used in the manufacturing of latex polymer.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:  The Ennis-Flint High Point facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations.  The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Contractors\n\n?    Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Hot Work Permit\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility meets the requirements of the RMP Emergency Planning and Response element as detailed below. These items, their specific requirements, and how the Ennis-Flint High Point facility complies with the requirements are addressed in the procedural documents.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history:  The Ennis-Flint High Point facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency, "

Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Contingency Plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  The facility will train their employees on an ongoing basis.  The safety systems and preventive measures are constantly evaluated and improved. This facility also expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of the RMP program.  All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia process.  Ennis-Flint will evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.\n\n"
