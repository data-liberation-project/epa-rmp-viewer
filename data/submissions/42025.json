      "SummaryText": "The City of Waynesboro owns a wastewater treatment plant which treats approximately 4.0 million gallons per day of industrial, commercial, and municipal wastewater generated throughout the city.  The operation of this plant is administrated by Earth Tech, Inc.  Once the wastewater has received both primary and secondary treatment, there still remain bacteria in the wastewater which may be harmful to both humans and the environment.  In order to kill these bacteria, chlorine is added at an average feed rate of 90-150 lbs-per-day to the wastewater via the tertiary sand filter.  After the appropriate amount of contact and mixing time, the bacteria are reduced in numbers to those approved by the state.  Following the chlorination process, a dechlorination agent, sulfur dioxide is then added at an average feed rate of 75-100 lbs-per-day for the purpose of chemically removing the chlorine prior to final effluent discharge into the South River.\n\nThe chlorination room is located at the side of the plant with two standard 1-ton containers connected to an automatic switchover system.  When one container becomes empty, the second automatically begins feeding.  Standard procedures dictates the need to then order a new 1-ton container for delivery.\n\nAlong with the chlorine containers in the chlorine room are the gas feed controls.  The chlorinator room is provided with a shatter resistant, hermetically sealed inspection window in an interior wall so that the equipment, ton cylinders, and instrument readings are observable.  The room has two doors to the building exterior.  One of the doors is installed with panic bars, and a self closing device.  The other door is opened only to allow cylinders to be moved in and out of the building.  Both doors remain closed at all times when they are not in use.  Floor drains terminate outside the building in a safe area for venting (gravity sewer).  All other openings in the room are sealed; the room is above grade, and the inside temperature"

The ton cylinders are restrained in a position stored separately from any organic materials, solvent or ammonia.\n\nChlorine is received at the plant and offloaded from the supplier with the use of an overhead hoist.  The maximum amount located on site at any given time is 4,000lbs.  New containers exchanged for empty containers with the new ones being placed on scales where daily weight measurements are taken.\n\nThe chlorine room is equipped with a chlorine sensing and alarm device to measure low concentrations of chlorine gas in the room.  The alarm is set to sound if the concentration reaches 3mg/l.  An exhaust fan operates automatically when the lights are turned on and remains on until the lights are turned off.  The complete details for entry during alarm or emergency operations are detailed in the facility emergency action plan.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\", and \"alternative scenario\".  This was accomplished utitlizing the RMP-Comp program.  The worst case release has radius of 1.30 miles, and the area includes several businesses, residents, industries, parts of the South River, a community recreation park, and schools.  The alternative release has a radius of 0.2 miles.  All of the entities in both areas are located on the maps included.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:  (1) Preventive maintenance program, (2) State of the art process and safety equipment, (3) Auditing and inspection program, (4) Training of operators, and (5) Review of O&M manuals, PSM and forms.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors.  A training seminar with demonstration specifically for chlorine was held for all plant employees by an i"

The Waynesboro Fire Department, specifically the HAZMAT team, is the local responder in case of emergency toxic release conditions.  Furthermore, the LEPC is notified in a the event of a toxic release.\n\nThe Health & Safety program is constantly evolving to provide new and accurate training for all employees at this site."
