Our facility engages in the receiving, storage, and relaoding of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Mangement Program and is subject of this plan. Only the facility used for this product will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored only with little if any product transfers taking place. The maximum quantity stored has been listed earlier in the RMP and will not be disclosed in this summary. Maximum quantity handled at a given time will be the unlaoding of a rail tank car or a semi-trailer tank.\n\nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected day and night during use, and throughout the off season.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\nOur accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is based on guidelines found in the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
