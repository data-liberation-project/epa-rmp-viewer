Only the facility used for this product will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be stored only with little if any product transfers taking place. The maximum quantity stored has been listed earlier in the RMP and will not be disclosed in this summary. Maximum quantity handled at a given time will be the unlaoding of a rail tank car or a semi-trailer tank.\n\nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected day and night during use, and throughout the \"off season\".\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\nOur accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is based on guidelines found in the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\" Additionally, we conduct employee training on the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including but not limited to: excess flow valves, breakaway couplers at risres, emergen"
