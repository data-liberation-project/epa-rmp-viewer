      "SummaryText": "This executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Fountain Valley Authority Water Treatment Plant (FVA), owned in part and operated in whole by Colorado Springs Utilities.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Accidental Response Policies\r\nColorado Springs Utilities has determined that this facility is required to comply with RMP Program 2.  Colorado Springs Utilities believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Colorado Springs Utilities has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was used in the development and implementation of the FVA Risk Management Plan for the chlorine system.\r\n\r\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no release would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\r\n\r\nColorado Springs Utilities takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at FVA) and actively participated in a comprehensive hazard review.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this wo"

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the FVA Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nFVA is located at 13250 Ray Nixon Road near Fountain, El Paso County, Colorado, 80817.  FVA takes Fry-Ark water from the Pueblo Reservoir, through a series of pump stations to the treatment plant, where the water is treated through coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection.  Chlorine is added to the raw water before coagulation, before filtration, and as the water leaves the plant for storage in the finish tank.\r\n\r\nThe plant treats 3.5 to 18 million gallons per day (MGD), depending on the time of year.  The design treatment capacity of FVA is 18 MGD, which is expected to be the average daily treatment rate in 2017.  From the plant, the treated water is pumped to five different entities for public consumption.  \r\n\r\nFVA utilizes chlorine as a disinfecting agent in the treatment of drinking water and is regulated under Program 2 of the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\r\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the FVA Risk Management Plan manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\r\n\u00b7 Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment.\r\n\u00b7 Hazard review, which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of the following:  the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administra"

In the event of a release of chlorine in the storage room, the normal ventilation system shuts down and the chlorine-contaminated air is sent to the scrubber for neutralization.  The scrubber is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chlorine release event.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThis facility is included in the Colorado Springs LEPC emergency response program.  In addition, FVA has established and maintains emergency procedures, which include an evacuation and notification plan.  The goals of the established procedures are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases, and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The procedures are routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.
