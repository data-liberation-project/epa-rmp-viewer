If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nA.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThis facility strives to exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia regulations.  Training is provided for each employee upon initial hire and annually thereafter.  The anhydrous ammonia process is inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. \n\n\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 836,332 pounds in one 30,000 gallon storage tank, one 26,000 gallon storage tank, and 140 nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nC.    Worst-case release scenario and the Alternative release scenario\n\n\n\nA.    The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 128,010 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\nB.    The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 14.29"

General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". In addition, Minnesota Department of Agriculture Rules, \"Chapter 1513\".\n\n\n\nE.    5-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nF.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.    A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standards, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nb.    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111(EPCRA).\n\nc.    Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nG.
