However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\r\n\tSUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in south central Benton County southwest of Finley, Washington.  The plant occupies approximately five acres at the junction of Chemical Drive and the Northern Railroad tracks on the west bank of the Columbia River.\r\n\r\nThe Facility produces and distributes agricultural and industrial chemicals for the northwest market.  Production at the Facility consists of the manufacture of fertilizers, pesticides, chemicals used for metal extraction in the mining industry, and chemicals used in the kraft paper industry.  \r\n\r\nProducts at the Facility include the manufacture or storage of several agricultural products: one ammonium polysulfide (APS) products, ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), calcium thiosulfate (CaTS) and potassium thiosulfate(KTS).  In addition to these agricultural products, the Facility produces the pesticides lime sulfur, metam sodium and metam potassium, as well as the metal extractants.  \r\n\r\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials. The large number of products and their raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any re"
