These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n5.0\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe City of Nacogdoches WWTP employees will not respond to a chemical emergency at the plant.  As required by 40 CFR Part 68.90, the City of Nacogdoches is included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe City of Nacogdoches WWTP has developed chemical specific operating procedures, training procedures, and maintenance procedures. These procedures will then be implemented in order to attain compliance with RMP regulation requirements as well as to ensure the safe operation and mechanical integrity of the RMP regulated process."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n1.0\tREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe City of Nacogdoches Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) uses two regulated chemicals, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, in the treatment process of the municipal water supply.\r\n\r\nChlorine is used in the disinfection of municipal wastewater. Chlorine is stored prior to and during use in 1-ton containers. The chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquefied gas, and is released into water using a pressurized system. The maximum intended chlorine inventory at the facility is 24,000 pounds which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe facility uses sulfur dioxide in the removal of chlorine from treated wastewater. Sulfur dioxide is stored prior to and during use in 1-ton containers on an unenclosed, covered, concrete pad. The sulfur dioxide is stored as a liquefied gas and released into wastewater using a pressurized system. The maximum intended sulfur dioxide inventory at the facility is 24,000 pounds which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tPOLICIES\r\n\r\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are toxic chemicals and precautions must be taken in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to facility personnel and to reduce the threat of accidental release which might result in exposure to the surrounding community and to the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and industry rules, regulations, and guidelines. Chemical safety at the City of Nacogdoches WWTP is dependent upon strict operating procedures, safe handling methods, and thorough training of employees. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety devices are also inherent in the design of the facility and in the equipment used in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemical processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tWORST CASE/ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO ANALYSES INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\r\n\r\nEPA defines the worst-case scenario as total failure of the largest ves"
