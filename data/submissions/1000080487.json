              "Description": "This process consists of two ethylene oxide storage tanks that are interconnected with seven reaction vessels in a manufacturing building with interconnected piping.  The storage tanks are located within a concrete diked area complete with a firewater sprinkler system and a flammable vapor detection system.  The tanks are pressure vessels with a design working pressure of 75 PSIG.  The storage tanks utilize relief valves with rupture discs, freon refrigeration and a nitrogen gas (inert) blanketing system as control devices.  The storage tank area contains a firewater system supply controlled by a flammable vapor detection system.  The presence of flammable vapor causes the fire water sprinkler system to activate causing a water deluge to occur in the ethylene oxide storage tank area.   The reactor vessels have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, a nitrogen gas purge system, emergency air supply, computer distributed control system, plus an instrument interlock system which will not allow ethylene oxide to be fed into a reactor vessel unless a number of process parameters are satisfied.  The plant personnel are trained annually in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, hazard communication training and HAZWOPER training.  All production tickets are reviewed by the engineering department after a production run has been completed.",

              "Description": "This process consists of two propylene oxide storage tanks that are interconnected with seven reaction vessels in a manufacturing building.  The storage tanks are located within a concrete diked area, complete with a firewater sprinkler system and flammable vapor detection system.  The storage tanks are pressure vessels with a design working pressure of 75 PSIG.  The storage tanks utilize relief valves with rupture discs, freon refrigeration, and a nitrogen gas (inert) blanketing system.  The storage tank area contains a firewater system supply controlled by a flammable vapor detection system.  The presence of flammable vapor causes the firewater sprinkler system to activate causing a water deluge to occur in the propylene oxide storage tank area.  The reactor vessels have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen gas purge, system emergency air supply, a computer distributed control system, plus an instrument interlock system which will not allow propylene oxide to be fed into a reactor vessel unless a number process parameters are satisfied.  The plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, and HAZWOPER training.  All production tickets are reviewed by the engineering department after a production run has been completed.",

              "Description": "This process consists of the formaldehyde storage tank, seven reactor vessels in one manufacturing building, seven reactor vessels in another manufacturing building, and the interconnecting piping.  The formaldehyde is stored in two insulated heated above ground storage tanks.  The storage tank areblanketed with nitrogen gas and the nitrogen gas/formaldehyde vapors are vented to the plant vapor combustor system as a control device.  The tank is equipped with high liquid level shutoff protection and relief valve protection.  A firewater system with hydrant monitors is available for use in fire conditions.  Both fire fighting foam and spill control (vapor suppression) foam is maintained at the plant.  The reactor vessels in all three manufacturing buildings have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen purge systems, a vapor combustor for vapor destruction, emergency air supply, a computer distributed control system for batch reaction control in the two buildings and PLC control in the third building.  The plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, hazard communication training, and HAZWOPER training.",

Methyl Chloride is stored as a pressurized liquid.  The storage cylinders utilize excess flow check valves and pressure relief valves as control devices.  The storage cylinders are inspected and maintained to code specifications.  A firewater system with hydrant monitors is available for use as a mitigation device for methyl chloride vapors in the event of an air release.  The reactor vessels in the manufacturing building have relief valves, pressure and temperature control systems, manual and automatic shutoff valves, check valves, alarms, rupture discs, nitrogen purge systems, a vapor combustor for vapor destruction, emergency air supply, and a computer distributed control system for batch reaction control.  The plant personnel are annually trained in emergency response procedures including fire brigade training, hazard communication training, and HAZWOPER training.",

Baker Petrolite does not expect a WCS to ever occur, however an ACS is a more realistic scenario that is more likely to occur.  The ACSs will help the LEPC to improve the community emergency response plan.  If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator at (281) 291-3260.\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Bayport Facility.  The processes at the Bayport Facility are not only regulated by the EPA RMP regulation, but are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe Bayport Facility encourages plant employees to participate in all areas of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employee participation ranges from updating technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. The employees have access to all information contained in the Baker Petrolite plant accident prevention program. One of the ways process safety and employee safety issues are addressed is in the monthly plant safety committee meetings. The committee consists of plant operators and management personnel.\n\n\n\nBaker Petrolite keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of processes.  Chemical specific information is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). The SDSs are maintained and located online and can be access through the Baker Hughes Intranet. Block diagrams on PSM covered processes are included in the Bayport PSM Manual along with maximum intended inventories of PSM covered chemicals. Additionally, safe designed upper a"

The Bayport facility ensures the processes are maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems. An evaluation of consequences of deviation is included in the Bayport PSM Manual. The following information is maintained by the plant engineering department: materials of construction, piping and instrument diagrams, electrical classifications, relief valve design, ventilation system design, design codes and engineering standards employed in the plant, and safety system interlocks/suppression systems. A program is in place for all process equipment to comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n\n\nBaker Petrolite has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with various processes. Each process is systematically examined to identify process hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Baker Petrolite uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method to perform these systematic reviews. The HAZOP team consists of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as accident prevention and makes suggestions for additional measures as needed. The team findings are then documented and all approved changes are implemented for corrective action. These periodic reviews are conducted on a 5 year cycle and will continue until the covered process is no longer operating. Again, the team findings are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nBaker Petrolite LLC maintains written procedures for the manufacture of specialty chemicals.

In addition to the \"batch tickets\", there are written plant standard operating procedures (SOP) which cover activities that are general in nature to a large number of common tasks. These SOPs cover general tasks such as; forklift operations, chemical storage tank filling, container storage, sampling procedures, housekeeping, and other activities common to many of the specialty chemical processes. Emergency shutdown instructions are contained in the Bayport Production Standard Operating Procedure Manual (P-26, P-27 and P-28). The \"batch tickets\" are reviewed after each batch to ensure they reflect current operating practices.\n\n\n\nBaker Petrolite LLC has a company training program for all plant operations employees. New employees receive basic orientation training in plant operations regardless of their previous experience level. After successfully completing this training, the new operator is then assigned to a more experienced operator with job experience to perform the duties and tasks in the new job assignment. After the new operator can demonstrate the ability and knowledge (through oral and written testing) to perform the job in a safe manner on his own, he will begin to work alone. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training.\n\n\n\nBaker Petrolite LLC uses a contractor who specializes in contract maintenance and other outside contractors for construction activities as required. Because the contractors work on or near process equipment, there are procedures in place to ensure that contractors; perform their work safety, have sufficient knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their work area, understand emergency procedures, follow site specific safety rules, and inform Baker Petrolite personnel of any hazards they find in the area.
