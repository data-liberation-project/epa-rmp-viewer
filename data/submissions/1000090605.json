Process Safety Information organizes the documentation and availability of written process safety information, pertaining to hazards of the chemicals used, the technology, and equipment covered in the process. The management system identifies the currently available information and establishes guidelines for producing\nadditional information. Process Hazards Analysis provides the structure for identifying, evaluating, and controlling processes involving anhydrous ammonia. Process Hazard Analysis Team defines the selected employees who shall participate in the formal PSM program activities based on their familiarity with the ammonia refrigeration system. Operating Procedures defines the format, structure, and change method for specific procedures developed for operating the ammonia refrigeration system. These procedures and practices are critical in maintaining a safe\noperation. Training defines the requirements and establishes the process for initial and follow-up operations training for employees working in hazardous areas. The material is then developed to meet the specific training requirements, and must include verification of training and employee training documentation. Contractor Control organizes contractor safety programs in the plant and ensures that the critical aspects of working in a hazardous area is included in the program. This includes specific record keeping requirements associated with contractors working in hazardous areas. Pre-startup Safety Review provides guidelines for reviewing new or modified hazardous facilities prior to startup. These guidelines require that the facility is installed in accordance with design specifications, confirms that the Process Safety Information is updated and accurate, operating procedures are in place, and training is completed prior to startup.

In the event of a liquid ammonia leak, the king valves (outlet of the high pressure liquid receiver) can be closed manually to prevent flow of ammonia liquid to downstream equipment. The system can be shutdown by the \n emergency stop stations located in and outside the engine room.  In addition, ammonia sensors located in the engine room. The facility is equipped with a sprinkler system.\nResponse Capabilities\nThe facility evacuates only and relies on the Madison Fire Department and the ammonia contractor for response.\nAmmonia System Summary\nMajor equipment components include:\n6 Compressors\n58 Evaporators\n2 Evaporative Condensers\n1 Purger\n3 Liquid Recirculators\n6 Ammonia Pumps\n1 High Pressure Liquid Receiver\n2 Brine Chillers\nAmmonia inventory: 15,357 lbs.\nAmmonia system operators: One operator.\nAmmonia System Contractor: American Refrigeration\nProcess Safety Management/Risk Management Program Description\nThe facility has a fully implemented process safety management / risk management program including:\nEmployee Involvement is to provide guidelines for employee open access to Process Safety Mana"
