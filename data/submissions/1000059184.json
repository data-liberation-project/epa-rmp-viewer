Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Arctic Cold Storage LLC has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Arctic Cold Storage LLC, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Arctic Cold Storage LLC has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

      "SummaryText": "ows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall. From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere are two ammonia detectors installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. Both sensors are set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and one detector will activate a strobe. Also, an ammonia detection sampling system is installed in each refrigerated room that provides at least every 15 minutes interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the north exterior wall of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Arctic Cold"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nArctic Cold Storage LLC has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Arctic Cold Storage LLC facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nArctic Cold Storage LLC has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nArctic Cold Storage LLC's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupatio"
