      "SummaryText": "Ohio Edison Company (OE) operates a 427 MW (NDC) coal-fired electrical generating plant, known as the RE Burger Plant, in Shadyside, Ohio.  Federal and Ohio environmental regulations increasingly are requiring coal-burning utilities to reduce emissions of pollutants including nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and mercury.  In response to regulations, pollution control providers are developing multi-pollutant control technologies.  One such technology is a process being developed by Powerspan Corporation known as Electro-Catalytic Oxidation or ECO.\n\nOE is working with Powerspan to implement a Commercial Demonstration Unit or CDU to further the development of this innovative control technology.  This involves constructing a commercial plant and tying into the flue gas stream from one of the operating units at the RE Burger Plant.  The system is scheduled to operate for a period of about one year during 2004.  If successful, OE may decide to continue operation of the process.\n\nThe ECO process utilizes several chemical reagents including aqueous ammonia for NOx control.  Similar to other NOx control processes, ECO reduces NOx emissions by reacting flue gas containing NOx with ammonia to form nitrogen and water.  The source of ammonia employed here is a 29% by-volume concentration water solution.  EPA?s Risk Management Planning (RMP) threshold for coverage under the rule is any process with aqueous ammonia of 20% concentration in quantities over 20,000 pounds.  OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) threshold for coverage is any process with aqueous ammonia of 44% concentration in quantities over 15,000 pounds. Accordingly, this RMP covers processes as described in this RMP exceeding EPA RMP thresholds for aqueous ammonia but not the OSHA PSM concentration threshold. \n\nRMP covered processes include all areas in the ECO CDU system where aqueous ammonia exists in concentrations above the RMP threshold of 20%.  This includes the truck unloading operations,"

      "SummaryText": " storage tanks and transfer lines up to the point of mixing in the ECO scrubbing tower, where the concentration falls below the concentration threshold as it is mixed in a solution with process liquor and circulated into the emission control cycle.  Covered activities related to this process include the use, operation, repair, replacement and maintenance of equipment in the process.  All personnel involved in these activities are properly trained in normal and emergency or upset operations.\n\nAs defined by the rule, the worst case release is the failure of the aqueous ammonia storage tank (single largest vessel) inside the storage tank containment area.  This is assumed to release the contents instantly and would result in an evaporating pool of ammonia gas from the surface of the solution contained.  Utilizing analytical methods provided by EPA results in a distance to toxic endpoint that reaches just off site and may minimally impact public or environmental receptors off site.    \n\nSeveral alternate case scenarios, which may be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario described above, were examined to assess their potential to impact public receptors as well.  The scenario selected for inclusion in the RMP is that of a pipe failure downstream of the storage tank allowing aqueous ammonia to discharge onto the ground for about 10 minutes until the condition is identified and the pumps shut down.  Utilizing analytical methods provided by EPA results in a distance to endpoint that reaches just off site and may minimally impact environmental receptors immediately to the south along the Ohio River.  \n\nAs this is a new process, there have been no accidents to date regarding this process.  In considering the potential to impact public receptors, the concentrations and quantities handled on site, and having no record of accidents, OE is registering this process at the RE Burger Plant under the RMP Program as a Program 2 process.

      "SummaryText": "gram has been developed and implemented at the Plant.\n\nThe Program 2 Prevention Program addresses required elements of Accident Prevention Planning including: the compilation of and access to process safety information regarding aqueous ammonia and the technologies and equipment used to handle and use it; the conduct of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and implementation of recommendations during the design and implementation of the ECO CDU system; development and implementation of operating and maintenance procedures for safe handling during startup, shutdown and normal, temporary and emergency operations; general training on the system and hazards of aqueous ammonia for all employees and specific training for those involved in the operation and maintenance of the ECO CDU process; a maintenance program with elements to manage mechanical integrity, manage changes and review safety after maintenance operations; conduct of periodic audits of the entire program; and continued implementation of accident and spill incident investigation programs at the plant. \n\nEmergency Response planning has long been an integral part of operations at the R.E. Burger Plant.  Regulations under OSHA, EPA, and Ohio EPA have required the plant to develop and implement procedures to plan for and respond to emergency situations at the plant whether due to natural disasters and storms, exposure to releases of hazardous chemicals or harm and damage due to flammable or explosive materials.  These procedures have been documented in the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\n\nThe Emergency Response Procedure developed around the Aqueous Ammonia ECO CDU process, as required by the RMP Regulations, is built on strong programs and procedures already in place at the RE Burger Plant.  Supplementing this procedure is the Emergency Action Plan (aqueous ammonia) which describes hazards and response requirements for aqueous ammonia in particular."
