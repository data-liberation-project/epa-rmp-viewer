Facility  Policy:   The owners, management, and employees of Bayhill Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspection and maintenance and training of all persons tha work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so the can plan for resorse to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n         2.       Facility information:   The primary activity at the facility is storage of fertilizer for sale to farmer. Anyhdrous ammonia ia received, stored, and  distributed for direct application as a NUTRIENT for crop production.  The  maximum quantity stored would be 385,000  pounds in the storages and nurse tanks.\n\n          3.       Worse-case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:   The worse case release scenario would be the release of the total content of one of the storage tank release as a gas over 10 minunite. The maximum quantity release would be 119,000   pounds, which represents the volume of one of the storage tank at 85 persent capacity as limited by design standard and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is .1.09 miles.\n\n                      The alternative case release scenario is assumed to be release from a rupure of a 1 inch transfer hose, with 2900 pounds realease over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .31 miles\n\n            4.        The accidental release program:    The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations related to the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solution, Containers and Storage Facilities.
