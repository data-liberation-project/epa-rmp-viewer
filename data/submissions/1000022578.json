It is DEXCO Polymers policy to implement the necessary and appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the DEXCO Polymers, VECTOR SBC Plant personnel along with contracted services of the Dow Chemical Company, Louisiana Operations well-trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  DEXCO Polymers is also coordinated with the Iberville Office of Emergency Preparedness (LEPC) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDEXCO Polymers, VECTOR SBC Plant started operations in 1989 as a joint venture of the Dow Chemical Company and Exxon.   In April 2011, Taiwan Synthetic Rubber Company purchased DEXCO Polymers.\n\n DEXCO Polymers, VECTOR SBC Plant uses butadiene, isoprene, and styrene to produce a styrenic block copolymers.   We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are 1,3-Butadiene, Isoprene  [1,3-Butadiene, 2-methyl-], and Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-].\n\nButadiene and Isoprene are raw materials used to make the block copolymer synthetic rubber product.  They are flammable gases with a mild aromatic odor.  High vapor concentrations could cause eye, nose, throat irritation and dizziness.  \n\nIsopentane is a solvent used in the production of the block copolymer synthetic rubber product.  It has mild gasoline like odor. Effects of overex"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDEXCO Polymers, VECTOR SBC Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was originally designed and constructed in accordance with the Dow Chemical Company's Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Chemical Engineering Standards.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nDexco Polymers Operations maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Some of this documentation includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment spec sheets, and reactive chemicals tests.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nDexco Polymers conducts periodic comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined), Fire and Explosion Index, Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis.  The"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 07/14/2010.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, Dexco Polymers maintains and periodically updates written standard operating procedures (SOPs).  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup.  The procedures are readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nDexco Polymers has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  All new employees are provided the applicable training (initial class-room training and on-the-job mentoring), depending on the nature and location of their assignments, before they are allowed to perform on their own.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nDexco Polymers carries out and documents periodic maintenance checks on process and safety equipment to ensure proper operations and to minimize/prevent incidents resulting from mechanical failures or equipment breakdowns..  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, process instrumentation and controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Dexco Polymers. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nDexco Polymers conducts audits on a regular basis to verify that the provisions and requirements of the RMP rule are complied with. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nDexco Polymers promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nDexco Polymers truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.

Dexco's expectations are communicated to the contractor and evaluated frequently during activities. Contractors are required to communicate hazards discovered during their activities and their plan to mitigate the risk. All significant safety or environmental events are investigated and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\n\nThe DEXCO Polymers, VECTOR SBC Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum. There have been no RMP-reportable accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances from our facility within the last 5 years. \n\n \n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\n\nDexco Polymers has a written emergency response procedure that provides a general description of the actions to take in the event of a plant emergency involving an injury, fire, spill, or explosion. Links to more specific emergency procedures, such as loss of utilities, are also included in this procedure for reference. The emergency response plan and the emergency procedures are reviewed and updated, if required, annually.
