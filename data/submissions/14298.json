It is our policy to\nadhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner\nin which we handle chlorine, the safety devices used in each facility  and the training of our\nemployees.\n\n     The  Authority supplies raw water to member cities and uses chlorine to control biological\nactivity in the aqueduct.  This is done by injection at four chlorine stations.  These stations are\nlocated at; 1)  #1 Chlorine Station 1 1/4 miles NW of the city of Sanford, Texas, 2) Borger\nChlorine Station at 1800 So. Florida, Borger, Texas; 3)Amarillo Chlorine Station at 24 th and\nFritch Hwy in Amarillo, Texas; and 4) Kress Chlorine Station, 1 mile NNW of Kress, Texas on\nHwy 87.  Access to all of these sites is restricted to authorized employees and authorized\ncontractors.  The maximum chlorine stored at each of these facilities:\n     #1 Chlorine Station      8000 pounds\n     Borger Chlorine Station  4000 pounds\n     Amarillo Chlorine Station     8000 pounds\n     Kress Chlorine Station   4000 pounds\nMaximum total inventory            24000 pounds\n\n     The following are the worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios\nwith administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported\nscenario.\n     \n     #1 Chlorine Station\n          Worst Case Scenario - failure of all (4) 1-ton cylinders simultaneously would\nrelease 8000 pounds of chlorine,  assumed to be in the form of vapor.  The distance to the\nendpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm), using the EPA RMP*(TM) model, will be 4.20 miles.\n          Alternate Release Scenario - A pipe (tubing) failure allows a leak of 1840 pounds\nfor 35 minutes.

The distance to the endpoint of\n0.0087 mg/L (3ppm), using the EPA RMP*(TM) model, will be 3.0 miles.\n          Alternate Release Scenario - A pipe (tubing) failure allows a leak of 1400 pounds\nfor 180 minutes.

We operate our system to maintain the process as it was designed and\nnot on a \"fix it when it breaks down\" schedule.\n\n     An accidental release occurred on July 26, 1996.  There were no injuries.  There were\nsome leaves on a tree that were damaged and the adjacent roads were closed for about 30\nminutes.  The Tulia Fire Department assisted with backup and support. \n\n      The Texas Tier Two Emergency Response Program is the basis for dealing with chlorine\nleaks, and is updated annually.\n\n     The following are planned changes to improve chlorine response safety:\n     1)   Purchase a level \"A\" vapor protective suit, and train people how to use it.  This is \n          to be used in conjunction with the local LEPC response.\n     2)   Send 2 maintenance people to a seminar for Chlorine Operations.\n     3)   Have emergency response training for the people who respond to a chlorine leak."
