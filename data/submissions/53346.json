      "SummaryText": "At AECI, safety is first priortiy in every job and project. Safety is emphasized continually, from daily tailgate meetings to monthly audits.  Employees are encouraged to take responsibility for safety.  AECI's Thomas Hill Energy Center has 3 coal-fired electrical generating units.  Ammonia, up to 612,000 pounds, will be needed to operate the 4 new, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices which have been retrofitted to each unit, with 1each on Units 1&2 and 2 SCRs being needed to treat the flue gas from Generating Unit #3.  The SCRs capture Nitrogen Oxides (Nox) in the discharge gas stream by injecting ammonia gas into the flow and then capturing the Nox on the surfaces of a catalyst.   The ammonia process will consist of tank storage (4 30,000 gallon tanks), with piping to vaporization systems located on each SCR structure.  Once vaporized, the ammonia will be piped to the injection ring within the ductwork where it will react with the Nox in the flue gas.  Generally, accidental release prevention will center around an aggressive preventative maintenance program involving frequent system inspections and checks.  The program will comply with the OSHA process safety management program.  Since ammonia has not yet arrived onsite (commission date is projected for 1/8/09), there have been no accidents associated with ammonia.  The plant has a good safety record overall, and trains its own emergency response team (ERT).  Volunteer employee team members receive about 20 hours of training per quarter.  The team also interacts with the local volunteer fire departments and the Randolph County LEPC.  In addition, the entire security staff consists of certified emergency medical technicians and the plant has its own ambulance.  On 12/3/08, AECI made a presentation to the Randolph County LEPC informing them about the upcoming ammonia deliveries and the safety program in place and developing at the power plant.  Randolph County is in the process of implementing a Code Red sys"
