We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nEnterprise's Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal is used to receive a Propane/Propylene mixture (P/P mix) in tank trucks and to transfer this mixture via pipeline to Enterprise's Propylene Splitter III.  The mixture is transferred from the tank trucks into one of three Propane/Propylene mix storage tanks which serve as a feed liquid supply to pipeline pumps and a transfer pipeline which ship the offloaded mixture to a fractionation unit that separates the Propane from the Propylene via distillation.\nThe terminal also receives a purified Propane product in tank trucks and transfers this Propane to long term underground storage.  The Propane is unloaded from the tank trucks into one of eleven propane storage tanks which serve as a feed liqui"

The terminal also receives purified Propane product from storage via pipeline and stores the product in one or more of the eleven propane storage tanks for delivery into tank trucks.\n\nThe terminal has a mercaptan storage and injection system to inject mercaptan odorant into tank trucks that will deliver the Propane to retail distributors.  The amount of mercaptan in storage at the East Product Handling Terminal is below the threshold quantity of the RMP regulation.\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nListed flammable substances which are handled or stored above the threshold quantities at the Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal are the propane/propylene mixed product that is offloaded from tanker trucks, and a pure propane product that can be offloaded from or loaded onto tanker trucks.  Our accident prevention program and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are present to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nThe Truck Terminal Operations process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating pro"

In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire detectors on gas compression equipment\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., c"

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.\n\nEmployees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu group, with includes the Mont Belvieu police, fire department, and Emergency Medical Service, as well as the Chambers County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Mont Belvieu East Product Handling Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.
