Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, blended, and then distributed to area farms as a non-hazardous, non-regulated source of land applied fertilizer.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Program\r\n         \r\nAt this J.R. Simplot Company retail agriculture fertilizer location, Anhydrous Ammonia is only present in railcars.  There is no permanent ammonia storage at this location.  Occasionally a contractor comes to the site to blend a non-hazardous fertilizer with the analysis 10-34-0.  The contractor connects full railcars of anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid to their batching unit.  Procedures and training for this process is the responsibility of the contractor, as Simplot Employees are not involved with any Ammonia handling.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this site. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194. Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
