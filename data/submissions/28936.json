The Tex-Mex Cold Storage, Inc. emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe Tex-Mex Cold Storage, Inc. facility is located at 6665 East 14th Street, Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas. The food processing operation utilizes anhydrous ammonia in its process. A single tank on the south side of the property houses 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The container has manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency, and an alarm will trigger if a release occurs. Emergency air supply and power are available. The facility is manned twenty-four hours a day. The anhydrous ammonia processes are checked routinely throughout the day.  Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored strategically throughout the facility.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Tex-Mex Cold Storage, Inc. facility included consideration of two different release scenarios for each parameter of concern (anhydrous ammonia): \n1. A Worst-Case Release\n2. An Alternative Scenario\nThe EPA guidelines define ?Worst-Case Release? resulting from an unspecified failure in which, ?The owner-operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes.? The same guidelines define an ?Alternative Scenario? as, ?More likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.?\n\nPerformance of atmospheric dispersion modeling determines the distance traveled by a parameter of concern before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint.? The EPA defines ?toxic endpoint? as 0.14 ppm for anhydrous ammonia. This value corresponds to the Emergency Response Planning"

An agreement with Chemical Response & Remediation Contractors, Inc. (CRRC) has been made for assistance with emergency response.\n\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n\nThe City of Brownsville?s Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility?s emergency response program. Both departments are members of the Cameron County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually."
