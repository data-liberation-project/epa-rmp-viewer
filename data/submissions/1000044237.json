      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n\n\n\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Nestle Foods facility in Little Chute, Wisconsin, is required to have a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) because the facility stores greater than 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The RMP was originally issued in 1998 and is being updated again as part of the required 5 year review under 40 CFR 68.190.  Required elements of the executive summary are listed in section 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n\n\nThis RMP is required for the ammonia refrigeration system contained within the Nestle facility in Little Chute, Wisconsin.  The goal of the RMP regulations, under the Chemical Accident Prevention rule (40 CFR 68), is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials that could affect the public or the environment and to mitigate the effects of releases that do occur. The Nestle Foods facility in Little Chute, Wisconsin, has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia).  This facility has implemented the use of an electronic preventive maintenance system, which manages preventative maintenance, inspection, and training aspects of release prevention.\n\n\n\nNestle has developed and implemented emergency response procedures at this facility and provides emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Little Chute Fire Department and LEPC (Outagamie County Emergency Coordinator), in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNestle Pizza Division- Little Chute Factory, manufactures frozen pizza products at the Little Chute plant. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes for the primary process at this facility are 311412 and 3114121.  Nestle has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the Little Chute plant - ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia threshold"

The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 175,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe most recent PSM compliance audit was completed in May 2014.  All changes resulting from the compliance audit have been incorporated into Nestle's programs.  PSM compliance audits are conducted every 3 years.\n\n\n\nNestle is committed to continuously making safety improvements. Currently, the Nestle Pizza Division is moving valves and ammonia pumps from the spiral freezer vestibules to improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system, and is targeted to be finished in 2014.\n\n\n\nA brief summary of key aspects of the prevention program is provided below:\n\n\n\n?    The facility employs a full-time PSM coordinator to ensure the facility's program elements are in compliance and procedures are being followed.\n\n?    Utility/maintenance personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round.\n\n?    There is a plant wide ammonia detection system that alerts security and utility/maintenance personnel.\n\n?    Employees are included in the development of the PSM program.\n\n?    Most of the ammonia pipe work is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of ammonia release.\n\n?    The plant provides routine on-the-job training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68 requires the most recent review and revision dates for certain prevention program aspects to be included in the RMP update:\n\n\n\n?

Each month a portion of the operating procedures are reviewed and revised.

Accidental discharge of hazardous substances and hazardous waste into the environment.\n\n\n\n?    Measures to be taken to prevent an accident.\n\n\n\n?    Countermeasures to be taken in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n?    Procedures for containing and limiting the duration of the emergency measures to be employed for further protection of employees responding to the emergency,\n\n        as well as other plant personnel.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan was most recently updated in January 2014.  Employees receive emergency response training annually (via computer-based training) and participate in emergency evacuation/take cover drills.\n\n\n\nOur comprehensive emergency response plan is designed"
