The Wickliffe Mill has more than 100 emergency responders trained in dealing with releases of materials specific to our mill operations.  A written emergency response plan contains a formal incident command system to allow a structured and efficient response to mill emergencies.  On-site materials and response activities have been reviewed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the State Disaster and Emergency Response Coordinator.  The Mill conducts periodic training exercises to maintain our readiness to respond to potential releases.  \nWickliffe Mill and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill that manufactures bleached pulp and coated and uncoated paper.  As part of our operation, the Wickliffe Mill manufactures and/or uses two chemical substances that are subject to the reporting requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The first regulated chemical substance is chlorine.  The mill withdraws water from the Mississippi River and pumps it to our filter plant for raw water treatment.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the raw water prior to its distribution into the mill.  The second regulated substance is chlorine dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is manufactured on-site and is used in the whitening of pulp in the pulp mill operating unit.     \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention:\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill continually evaluates ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In 1994, the Wickliffe Mill implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The EPA RMP rule, published in 1996"

      "SummaryText": ", established various levels of prevention program requirements.  Both the chlorine at the raw water filter plant and the chlorine dioxide at the pulp mill are Program 3 level processes.  This program level is similar to OSHA\u00bfs PSM program, except that the RMP program focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  A prevention program to meet these requirements has been developed for both the chlorine and chlorine dioxide processes.  The prevention program is comprised of the following 12 elements:\n\n\u00bf  Process safety information\n\u00bf  Pre-startup review\n\u00bf  Process hazard analysis\n\u00bf  Compliance audit\n\u00bf  Operating procedures\n\u00bf  Incident investigation\n\u00bf  Training\n\u00bf  Employee participation\n\u00bf  Mechanical integrity\n\u00bf  Hot work permits\n\u00bf  Management of change\n\u00bf  Contractors\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Wickliffe Mill has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at our mill.  Chlorine is supplied to the mill in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved one ton cylinders.  Chlorine is fed through a short section of piping to a mixer where it is safely absorbed into the mill's raw water feed.  The entire feed system is operated under a vacuum.  If the vacuum is lost, the cylinder valve will close automatically.  The materials of construction and the delivery system all meet the specifications of the suppliers.  Chlorine detectors are located throughout the areas where chlorine is present in the raw water filter plant.  These alarms are set to trigger below a concentration that would be dangerous to the operator.  The alarms are audible within the chlorine area and also alarm in the power center control room where displays are constantly monitored.  \n\nChlorine dioxide is generated on-site in a state of the art computer controlled process.  The dilute solution in water is stored in one tank and fed to the process through pumps and piping dedicated for chlorine dioxide service.  The materials of construction an"

The last accident associated with one of the regulated substances occurred in August 1999.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill has developed a written emergency response program centered on the mill's emergency disaster plan to help make the appropriate response to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The program includes information specific to both processes at the mill.  The information includes:\n\n\u00bf Evaluation of the accidental release, determination of evacuation and emergency response support, notification to appropriate public agencies and management personnel.\n\u00bf Controlling and containing accidental releases, including the use of emergency response equipment and the inspection, testing, and maintenance of that equipment.\n\u00bf Providing first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposure to hazardous substances.\n\u00bf Training for employees in relevant procedures.\n\u00bf Procedures to review and update the emergency response program and update employees as necessary.\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill maintains an emergency response team of more than 100 members.

Additionally, the Wickliffe Mill has employees that actively participate on our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and volunteer on the local fire and rescue squads in our community.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe Wickliffe Mill continually strives to improve the safety of processes at the mill.  The chlorine and chlorine dioxide process safety is evaluated through a periodic review of the respective hazard and operability studies (HAZOP), management of change procedures, incident investigation programs, safety action teams, solicitation of safety suggestions from employees, and through best practices shared within our industrial sector.  Presently, no significant modifications to either regulated process are planned."
