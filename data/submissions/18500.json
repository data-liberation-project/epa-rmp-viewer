The palnt is located between a partialy industrialized and aprtialy residential area of Bayonne. The sit is 10.7 acers bordered by Ingaham Avenue to the east,Bay Ridge Lumber Comapny to the west and 5th and 2nd Streets to the north and south respectively.Block # 359,lots 5,6and 7 of the Tax Map of Bayonne.The front section building 10 (north side) serves as office headquarters as well as a warehouse.

The likelihood of any spill reaching the waterway is very slim.\nThere is one double waled undrground tank (7500 each) holding vinyl acetate adjacent to the building #8. The tank is fitted with visual and audible alarms. All UG  pipings are double walled.\nLEAK DETECTION & MONITORING PROGRAM\nEquipment and piping is visualy inspected by site personenel as part of a formal inspection that is fully recorded. Area supervisors are in charge of these inspections. The following inspection procedures are implemented on site.\nNorton maintains a daily inspection program. These inspections are intended to provide a mechanism to detect and prevent malfunctions and detecet equipment deterioration.They provide early warning of any potential events so that corrective actions may be taken.\nArea lighting,above ground valves,pumps and flanges that are used are inspected before use to insure that spills and leaks are prevented.Records are kept. Random walk through safety and environmental checks are performed daily.\nWORTS CASE SCENARIO.\nThe worst case scenario would occur if tank truck delivering product burst containing 6,000 pounds.Since all trucks unload in a diked area,concrete secondary containment"
