(RCS, Inc.) for Shipper's Warehouse in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). Shipper's Warehouse operates a warehouse facility with hazardous substances that are covered under 112(r). \n\nRCS, Inc. Has been retained by Shipper's Warehouse to investigate this facility's need to implement a Risk Management Plan. RCS, Inc. Reviewed Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for all products. Following the product review, four (4) products stored at the facility contained constituents that were listed under RMP.\n\nThe second stage in completing this plan was to investigate the storage history for each constituent. After review of the inventories, the investigation revealed that an aerosol propellant mixture containing Isobutane (propane) exceeded the threshold quantity listed in 112(r).\n\nThe RMP requirements were designed to facilitate communication to responders and the public in the event of a catastrophic release of the listed substances. These requirements also insure the continuing improvement and safety of each identified process. Major facilities needing to comply with 112(r) may be defined as; a facility that is used to store large volumes of highly hazardous substances for use in manufacturing, treatment processes or bulk storage. Some of the requirements are not applicable to a closed container non-bulk facility. All items that are not applicable are provided with an explanation in the attachments to this plan.\n\nThe RMP has three (3) different models to follow when completing a plan. The models are based on types of products, processes, and quantities. This plan meets the requirement of Program 1. \n\nUnder Program 1 Shipper's Warehouse is not required develop a plan in response  to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n 1.1 The a"

The facility will investigate all new products to determine if thresholds are met for toxic substances  requirements. \n\nThe contents of the flammable propellant mixture is regulated under the flammable substance category in the RMP. The worst case scenario would be a comprehensive incident, an act of God that is not controlled by Shipper's Warehouse. This may cause for destruction of one (1) 14oz. Aerosol can resulting in the entire release of a liquid flammable propellant mixture containing Isobutane (propane, 2-methyl). In this worst case scenario, no mitigating measures are present to contain the release. Under worst case weather conditions the dispersion cloud would travel 0.005 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. The endpoint distance was calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp version 1.07. \n\n 1.4 The general accidental release prevention program and chemical  specific prevention steps:\n\nShipper's Warehouse is compliant with The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP). In addition, this facility does extensive training, procedural review, and complies with the requirements of this rule. \n\nUpon hiring, and at required intervals, each employee is given Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous materials training, OSHA Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) training, and EPA Right-To-Know (RTK) training. In addition, all new employees are given additional training regarding Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) use and maintenance, loading and unloading, handling of material, forklift operation, emergenc"

The purpose of the safety committee is to review any incidents that may have occurred and discuss safety related issues in the facility. All issues are addressed and discussed until a viable solution is derived. All safety committee information is documented and recorded.\n\n 1.5 The five-year accident history:\n\nDue to the management of the processes, extensive training, and written operating procedures, this Shipper's Warehouse facility has not had a release in the past five years.\n\n 1.6 The emergency response program:\n\nShipper's Warehouse has an emergency response program in place. This plan describes the procedures to be implemented as a result of a release. Twice per year, the facility runs evacuation exercises based on a release scenario or in case of a fire. All evacuation exercises are timed and evaluated for effectiveness.\n\nIn addition, Shipper's Warehouse has developed and implemented a Contingency Plan.\n\n 1.7 Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nShipper's Warehouse is continually reviewing and improving procedures and processes to optimize performance and safety. The facility is not planning drastic changes to building structure, grounds, or mitigation systems."

The facility is located at 201 Sunridge Blvd., Wilmer, TX 75172. Product stored at the facility exceeds threshold requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 40, Part 68. In fully demonstrating compliance with the standards set forth in Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act, Shipper's Warehouse is implementing a Risk Management Program through this Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe facility is a closed-container distribution facility for appropriately marked, labeled and packaged non-bulk consumer products. Some products contain substances that are considered extremely hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These products are stored within specially designed areas of the warehouse. These locations have been engineered to store aerosol products, following guidelines established by Building Officials Code Association (BOCA) Guidelines, and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Guidelines.\n\nShipper's Warehouse is dedicated to providing a safe, publicly aware, environmentally friendly solution to logistics management. All procedures at the facility have been written to ensure employee and public safety. Procedures are continuously reviewed and revised based on facility need, management review and employee suggestions.\n\nWhen any employee discovers any release of a hazardous substance, the emergency response procedures developed at Shipper's Warehouse are implemented. The first step for a employee would be to immediately notify his or her supervisor. The supervisor will contact the Primary Emergency Coordinator. Upon notification of a release, the Primary Coordinator will contact the local fire department, the police department, the Community Emergency Planning Committee, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality  (TCEQ) Emergency Hotline, and the outside response"

The products that are stored at this facility are varied in concentrations, physical states, and constituents. Only a small amount of the products in the warehouse contain regulated hazardous substances. \n\nDue to the constant change in inventory driven by the industry demand Unilever product, Shipper's Warehouse does not have a steady amount of regulated substances in the warehouse. To determine the maximum amount of regulated substances stored in the building, a review of product inventories was conducted to achieve a historical maximum storage. The maximum storage was used to calculate possible quantities that may be released.\n\nDuring a review of all the products, including constituents and concentrations, it was determined that a flammable propellant mixture containing Isobutane (propane, 2-methyl) is above the thresholds designated by the EPA.
