The properties of the material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle the ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed in the facility, and the tranining of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTony's Fine Foods, Inc. is a wholesale food distribution warehouse.  It distributes both dry and refrigerated food products to retail outlets and restaurants.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system of the warehouse.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia at the site is completely contained within a closed loop system at all times and should never need to be refilled with replacement ammonia at any time under normal operating conditions.  An estimated 24,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is utilized within the refrigeration systems at the site.  The receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substance is considered a part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls exist to limit the distances for each reported scenario in order to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia system and the training provided to the ammonia operators.\n\n3b.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures exist to limit the distances for each reported scenario in order to restrict to a minimum the amount of ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to"

      "SummaryText": " not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing and maintenance of the refrigeration system and its related equipment and components with the anhydrous ammonia.\n\n4.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility complies with all applicable Federal and State codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The hazardous materials management and safety programs implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5.0  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of ammonia within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of West Sacramento Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  Yolo County Environmental Health can incorporate the response into the County Area Plan.\n\n7.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments to be made to the Process Hazard Analysis element of the RMP that will be implemented at this time for the next one and one-half years.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the RMP to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated substance in the regulated process of the refrigeration system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental release of the regulated substance.\n\n\n\n"
