The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative case release scenarios.  Sunoco Logistics has submitted these release scenarios to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Pittsburgh Terminal has not had an incident in the last five years involving LPG or that caused or had the potential to cause injury, death, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place scenarios.  No further issues have been observed in this system.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Pittsburgh Fire Department and Pittsburgh and Allegheny County LEPC.  A Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh Terminal maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and SARA Title III. The programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required"
