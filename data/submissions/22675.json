We believe all injuries can be prevented and expect all employees to assume the responsibility for working safely.\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in our safety program.  We take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Regulatory Compliance Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Farmland Dairies facility in Wallington, NJ processes milk and other dairy products.  The plant uses an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling for the dairy products and the production area.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 17,000 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the plant.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at the Farmland Dairies Plant involves the release of 9,700 pounds of ammonia due to the failure of the main receiver. This maximum inventory reflects the written administrative procedures in place at the plant to limit the amount of ammonia stored in the main receiver to 80% of its capacity.  Under worst-case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site impacts.\n\nThe alternative toxic release scenario at the plant involves the release of 775 pounds of ammonia over a 2 minute period due to the rupture of a ?\" liquid lin"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPasadena Cogeneration, L.P. has a strong commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  It is the policy of Pasadena Cogeneration to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPasadena Cogeneration, located in Harris County, Texas, is a gas-fired combustion turbine cogeneration plant that produces stream and electricity.  The steam is consumed by local and industrial users.  Electricity is also sold to local industry with the remaining output being placed on the grid for general consumption.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the three gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in three, individual storage tanks.  The total storage capacity of this toxic material exceeds the threshold level for RMP applicability. There are no other toxic or flammable materials on-site which exceed RMP levels.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a "

      "SummaryText": "toxic substance at Pasadena Cogeneration is a release involving one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  Based on guidance from the EPA, the WCS involves the complete inventory in the storage tank released over a 10-minute period.  The 14,200-gallon anhydrous ammonia tank is limited to 85% storage capacity by administrative controls.  Assuming a specific gravity of 0.6386 for liquid anhydrous ammonia, the maximum storage tank capacity is 64,284 lbs.  The WCS is modeled based on a release rate of 6,428 lbs/min.  The EPA's RMP*Comp model indicates that the endpoint for this type of release is 2.8 miles.  There are public receptors within this distance.  Therefore, a Program 3 RMP is required for the anhydrous ammonia process.\n\nAlternative scenarios were addressed as required by rule.  Based on EPA guidance, alternative release scenarios of anhydrous ammonia most likely involve flashing liquid releases.  The anhydrous ammonia systems are designed such that all piping downstream of the storage tank is laid beneath concrete.  Each storage tank is set in a reinforced concrete containment area which would contain any spills and also provides protection from any blast effects.  The truck loading point is surrounded by traffic posts and is equipped with pull-away valves and a breakaway hose.  There is a water deluge system over the storage tank which is triggered by an atmospheric concentration of 200 ppmv.  Anhydrous ammonia is water soluble.  If the deluge system is activated, the released anhydrous ammonia is flushed from the atmopshere.  The water/ammonia mixture enters the plant drainage system.  All piping and vessels have a pressure rating that is greater than normal operating pressures.  The system is equipped with redundant control systems including shutoff valves, pressure relief valves, pressure indicators, etc.  Alternative release scenarios were identified as: (1) tank leak due to external impact and, (2) tank truck pull-away.

Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nPasadena Cogeneration actively encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and participation in the process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to the PHA and all other information required to be developed under the process safety management standard.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPasadena Cogeneration maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations of the plant with regards to the anhydrous ammonia systems.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific personnel within Pasadena Cogeneration are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/-exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nPasadena Cogeneration has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nPasadena Cogeneration primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate s"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nPasadena Cogeneration maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) startup after an emergency shutdown, (7) operating limits, and (8) safety and health considerations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Pasadena Cogeneration has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the anhydrous ammonia process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators receive refresher training at least once every three years on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Pasadena Cogeneration evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nPasadena Cogeneration conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nPasadena Cogeneration has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating c"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) performing and documenting inspections and results, (2) conducting maintenance training, (3) developing written procedures, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Pasadena Cogeneration incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nPasadena Cogeneration has a hot work program in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  The hot work permit and procedures are designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the hazardous area.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nPasa"

In the event of an emergency, plant personnel can contact the Pasadena Fire Department.  Pasadena Cogeneration personnel can also contact the Houston Chemical Complex (HCC) via two-way emergency radio.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are equipped with a detector alarm that triggers at an atmospheric concentration of 200 ppmv.  In the event of an alarm, plant personnel assess the situation.  If it is determined that a major ammonia spill has occurred, plant personnel will contact the local fire department, the LEPC, the Pasadena police and county sheriff, and HCC.  Personnel will evacuate the plant and meet emergency response teams at the designated meeting point and accompany them to the proximity of the emergency.  Plant personnel are not trained nor equipped to respond to a worst-case release event in the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Pasadena Cogeneration periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Pasadena Cogeneration management will certify that the PSM has been evaluated at least every three years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant personnel for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process at Pasadena Cogeneration has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\n\nPlant employees are trained to handle small emergencies only.  Employees are not trained to respond to RMP releases.  In the event of an RMP release, employees will activate shutdown procedures, evacuate the plant, and notify local emergency response teams.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant processes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Pasadena Cogeneration is coordinated with the Pasadena Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes attendance at periodic LEPC meetings.  Pasadena Cogeneration has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nPasadena Cogeneration, L.P.
