No other employees are involved in the operation of this business.  I am committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of ammonia, and am prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities with any release of product.  The sole activity at this facility is storage of Anhydrous Ammonia and filling of nurse tanks for sale to farm customers.\r\nThe maximum amount stored in the 18,000 gallon storage tank is 75,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite at its peak sales periods.  Administrative operating procedures limit the storage tank to 85 percent of its capacity.  For approximately eight months of the year, maximum quantities of Anhydrous Ammonia are reduced to less than 25 percent (18,750 pounds) of the maximum pounds held in storage.  The company ensures that tanks and components are regularly maintained.  The facility is regularly inspected by the insurance carrier, OK State Department of Agriculture, and myself.\r\nThe worst case release scenario would be the total release of the contents of the storage tank in a ten minute period, despite the presence of all installed safety devices.  The maximum quantity release would be 75,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) has been calculated to be 3.0 miles from the tank at which point it would be dispersed enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. \r\nAn alternate release scenario, based on a more probable release, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  If the safety check valve failed to operate in the event of a transfer hose rupture, approximately 12,000 pounds would be released in a two minute period.  With a three meters per second wind the distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.49 mile.\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years.\r\nThis facility fo"
