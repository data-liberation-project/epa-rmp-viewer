Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: one-ton chlorine cylinders, piping systems, relief and ventilation systems, leak detectors, and controls.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Mechanical Integrity checks are conducted during chlorine change-out and one-ton chlorine delivery.\n3.6  Management of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Avenal Water Treatment Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, and any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n3.7  Pre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Avenal Water Treatment Plant.
