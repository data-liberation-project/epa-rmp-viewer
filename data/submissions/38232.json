The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe City of Woodland provides wastewater collection and treatment for the City.  Its Water Pollution Control Facility uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for these RS's.  The facility is located southeast of the city in an area developed for agriculture.  There are 10 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales and trunnion sets outside underneath a roof.  The chlorine is used for odor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the wastewater effluent, and for other process uses.  The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinat"

Pressurized liquid within a ton container is withdrawn through a copper pigtail and vaporized in an evaporator located in a separate room.  The pressurized gas from the evaporator is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve.  From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators or sulfonators, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of The City of Woodland that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Woodland has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the City of Woodland are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs. the City of Woodland has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection and dechlorination process.

The City of Woodland has instituted formalized program and document management procedures which are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps, and installing seismic restraints for the ton containers.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Woodland's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with Yolo County Communications Emergency Services Agency, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies and evacuation of persons on site to designated assembly areas upwind of the released gas.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which the City of Woodland committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  A change in progress at this time is to bypass the chlorine and sulfur dioxide evaporators and connect to the gas valves of the ton containers.  At the time of the upcoming plant expansion, it is planned to remove the liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide pressure piping and evaporators, and install vacuum regulator valves and automatic-closing valve operators directly on the ton container gas valves.
