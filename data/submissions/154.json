The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Seneca Fertilizer, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n-The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by farmers.\n\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 142,000 pounds stored in one stationary 30,000-gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or rail car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.   The maximum quantity released would be 140,196 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.11 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.41 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no "

The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OHSA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\nc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OHSA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
