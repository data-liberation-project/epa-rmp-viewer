Osage Fire Protection District.\n\nThis facility treats raw water to bring it to drinking water standards.  Chlorine is the only risk management program related substance used at the facility in excess of threshold quantities.  The use of chlorine is confined to within a chlorination system.  Safety systems associated with the chlorination system included vents, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, alarms, emergency air supply, emergency power, and written emergency procedures.  \n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Our prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, and a training program to ensure that our employees are knowledgeable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions.  If an incident does occur, it is thoroughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all affected employees.  We believe our prevention program is key to minimizing the risk to our employees, the public, and the environment.  \n\nIn the past five years, we have not had an accident involving chlorine that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine, we will immediately notify the Ft.
