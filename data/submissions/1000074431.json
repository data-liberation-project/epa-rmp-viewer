This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. Arrow's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Arrow Station 3 MRU Facility is used to recover NGLs from natural gas gathered from third-party producers that might otherwise be flared at the production pads. The Mechanical Refrigeration Unit (MRU) is rated to process up to 4 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) of inlet gas. The facility consists of the following; low pressure separator, inlet compression, high pressure separator, portable MRU, NGL stabilizer tower, and an ethylene glycol system. Condensate from the separators and compressor scrubbers are routed to two 18,000-gallon pressurized bullet tanks and produced water is routed to one 400-bbl produced water tank. NGLs from the stabilizer tower are routed to two 18,000-gallon pressurized bullet tanks. Condensate and NGLs are routed from the bullet tanks to tanker trucks. Ancillary equipment at the facility includes a flare, generator, pneumatic devices, and storage totes. Arrow expects to operate this facility for 6-9 months until additional pipeline takeaway capacity becomes available. \r\n\r\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; flammable mixture.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nProcesses at the Arrow Station 3 MRU Facility are"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The Arrow Station 3 MRU Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.
