We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n An overview of our emergency response program\n An overview of recent improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nOur facility uses sulfur dioxide in the production of Sodium Hydrosulfite and Zinc Oxide for use in the paper and rubber industries.  The EPA has identified sulfur dioxide as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Our storage tank holds 227 thousand pounds of sulfur dioxide at the site.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of sulfur dioxide.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios:\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario (as defined by the EPA) and alternative release scenario for our facility.

      "SummaryText": " these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario  Sulfur Dioxide\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the sulfur dioxide storage tank.  The evaporating sulfur dioxide could potentially reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  The site has implemented a process safety management system, including storage tank inspection and maintenance requirements, intended to prevent this type of incident from occurring.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario  Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe RMP alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the sulfur dioxde unloading hose, resulting in the release of approximately 45 pounds of sulfur dioxide in less than a minute.  The amount of sulfur dioxide that could be released is limited by an excess flow valve that would automatically close and stop the flow in the event of a hose failure.  Per the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, sulfur dioxide released in this scenario could impact public receptors within 0.2 mile of the facility.  The public receptor that could be impacted by such a release is a park.  However, the site has implemented a process safety management program that includes inspection and scheduled replacement of unloading hoses to prevent this type of scenario from occurring.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nChemical Release Prevention Program:\n\nAt the Clariant Corporation's Kalama Plant we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n Process safety information\n Process hazard analysis\n Operating procedures\n Training\n Mechanical integrity\n Management of change\n Pre-startup review\n Complia"

Our company and our employees are committed to maintaining these management systems and recognize that this is the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of sulfur dioxide in the past five years at our facility. In fact, none have occurred since the plant began operation in 1969.  However, we have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our facility.  If a significant release should occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event.\n\nEmergency Response Planning:\n\nWe maintain emergency response plans, which address all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Our plan also includes specific procedures for responding to a release of sulfur dioxide.
