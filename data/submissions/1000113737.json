In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEF Oxnard LLC has developed a written emergency plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes the following information describing the actions of employees over the course of a release event:\n\n- Alarm system activation and signal interpretation\n- Safe evacuation, assembly locations and return to the facility\n- Selection of response strategies based on type of incident\n- Incident command structure and emergency contact list\n- List of response equipment onsite and authorized use of equipment by employees\n- Release mitigation activities and measures in place\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis Revalidation study (performed on February 22, 2024), including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, completion of checklists, and a facility inspection provided mitigation measures to improve safety for the SCR system at the EFO LLC facility located at 550 Diaz Avenue in Oxnard, California.

These safety mechanisms allow the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank. Furthermore, ammonia sensors are installed at various locations throughout the facility, and there are automatic system shutdowns.\n\nA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the EF Oxnard LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; regularly scheduled shift walkdown and inspections of all major equipment, including valves and alarms; extensive use of procedural checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative maintenance system for tracking daily repair work orders and scheduled maintenance operations. \n\nAn operator training program encompassing operating procedures, safety and health, and emergency response refresher ammonia safety training, helps ensure that employees think, act, and work safely while on the job.\n\nIn addition to the OSHA PSM, the EF Oxnard LLC facility holds federal and state emergency response and safety plans.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines accident as the following:\n\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n-  On-site deaths, injuries, or significa"

Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,800-gallon tank and fed to the SCR unit. Current facility policy implements administrative controls to limit the contents to 85% of the tank capacity.  Therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that is handled in this system is 10,500 gallons. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIn the state of California, the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) has implemented a state driven Process Safety Management Program rule that also satisfies federal requirements. The facility maintains, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, its Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which provides for the identification, prevention and minimization of chemical releases that could result from failures in processes, procedures and equipment.  The major safety systems in place at the facility include process safety equipment and administrative safety procedures.  \n\nThe EF Oxnard LLC facility is designed and built according to accepted safety codes and standards for electrical, mechanical, and structural integrity.
