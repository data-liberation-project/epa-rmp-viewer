      "SummaryText": "Brookshire Brothers, Ltd is a grocery retail company with its own Distribution Center. The Frozen Distribution Center includes a frozen food vault, fresh meat vault, and an Ice Plant. Also a dairy section, egg and bakery products refrigerated warehouse is on the property. Both facilities have large industrial refrigeration systems that use Anhydrous Ammonia. The minimum amount of ammonia needed to operate the system is kept on hand. This minimum amount is above the threshold quantity so compliance with both PSM and RMP is mandatory. Our refrigeration system is a very basic system that is maintained by an excellent highly trained staff. The refrigeration department has ongoing training on both the refrigeration process and safety for the process. The freezer system has four compressors, three recirculating vessels, a thermosyphon vessel, an evaporative condenser, twenty evaporators, and two ice machines. The perishable has three compressors, three accumulators, and one constant pressure vessel, a pilot receiver, an evaporative condenser, forty-eight evaporators, and a glycol chiller. The mechanical integrity of these systems is constantly monitored and repaired or replaced as necessary."
