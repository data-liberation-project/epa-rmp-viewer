KNC?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this RMPlan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nKoch Nitrogen Company owns the cryogenic portion of the Greenwood Terminal; which includes the cryogenic tank containing refrigerated ammonia, as well as the pump and piping associated with that tank.  The remainder of the facility is owned by Magellan, including the ?hot? bullet and loading rack.  The entire facility is operated by Enterprise for KNC and Magellan.  The operations at the facility covered by this RMPlan include the receipt of ammonia via pipeline, the storage of ammonia in a cryogenic tank, and the pumping of ammonia to a loading rack.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at KNC?s portion of the Greenwood Terminal.  There are no RMP flammable substances at KNC?s portion of the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accide"

These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Greenwood Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Minimizing the possibility of overfilling by having level gauges and emergency shutdown capability to stop delivery of ammonia.\n?Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n?Providing high pressure alarms to shut down delivery of ammonia.\n?Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the flare system by having a backup power generator.\n?Providing ammonia sensors located on the perimeter and at the compressor building to shutdown the transfer of ammonia to cold storage.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History  \n\nWithin the last five years there have been no chemical release accidents that resulted in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe terminal will conti"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Lancaster County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the local hospital, the Norris Public Power, and the Nebraska State Highway Patrol.  The Greenwood Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the terminal include:\n\n?Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the terminal is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n?An ongoing dialogue with the Lancaster County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of re"
