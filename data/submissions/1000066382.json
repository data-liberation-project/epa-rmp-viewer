Century Plant refrigeration system located at 6999 Century Blvd. Hillsboro, OR uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a frequently used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant. Due to the quantity of anhydrous ammonia, it is considered a hazardous substance by the EPA. Several of the properties that make ammonia advantageous as a refrigerant also requires that detailed precautions and procedures be put in place to protect employee and public health and their safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n1.1.2.    Safety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is managed.  While the design of the facility incorporates a variety of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel and contractors are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n1.1.3.    We have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Action provisions. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\n1.2.    Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n1.2.1.    Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods. Production requires the use of one refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods. These refrigeration processes use ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees and visitors, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n1.2.2.    The regulated substa"
