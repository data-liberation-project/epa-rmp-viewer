      "SummaryText": "The City of Salem, Virginia is committed to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and recognizes the responsibility to prevent harm to employees and the public due to a chlorine release. Salem's accidental release prevention program integrates management practices, safety procedures, employee participation, process safety and operating information, process hazard analysis and compliance auditing, pre-startup reviews, mechanical integrity, management of change procedures, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and updating practices and procedures. Applicable requirements for Program 3 Risk Management Programs are adhered to. The emergency response program is tailored with respect to the available emergency responders and the City of Salem Local Emergency Planning Coordinator (LEPC) and includes notification procedures as well as plant evacuation procedures.\n\nThe chlorination system for the Salem Water Treatment Plant is used to disinfect drinking water. This water is supplied to the residents and businesses in or near the City. The chlorination facilities include a Chlorine Storage Room for one-ton cylinders and the necessary cylinder handling equipment, and a Chlorine Feed Room with ten chlorinators and various safety equipment and controls,. Normally chlorine is supplied from six one-ton cylinders connected to the process feed piping. The cylinders in service are controlled automatically using an automatic switchover device that limits operation from a single cylinder. Plant operators check the operation of the chlorination system at least once each shift and respond immediately to trouble or warning alarms.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis considers four chlorine release scenarios identified as the worst-case scenario and three alternate release scenarios. Predictive release information was obtained using the EPA's (Environmental Protection Agency) RMP* COMP model to identify the distance to endpoint for a potential c"

The distance to endpoint was estimated to be 1.30 miles from the chlorination facility assuming a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour and an atmospheric stability rating of \"Class F\". The potential population affected by the worst-case scenario was estimated to be 8,500 persons. \n\nThe first alternate release scenario involves a potential cylinder rupture where 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas may be discharged during a ten minute accidental release. The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be 0.20 miles from the chlorination facility assuming a wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour and an atmospheric rating of \"Class D\". The endpoint determination includes enclosure of the cylinder within the storage room. The potential population affected by the alternate release scenario was estimated to be 200 persons.\n\nThe second alternate release scenario involves a broken valve stem leaving a 1/2 inch diameter hole where chlorine gas may be discharged during a fifteen minute accidental release. It is assumed that the liquid level of the liquid chlorine in the cylinder is below the valve stem resulting in a vapor release of chlorine gas. This scenario releases 560 pounds of chlorine gas in fifteen minutes. The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be 0.10 miles from the chlorination facility assuming a wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour and an atmospheric rating of \"Class D\". The endpoint determination includes enclosure of the cylinder within the storage room. The potential population affected by the alternate release scenario was estimated to be 100 persons.\n\nThe third alternate release scenario involves a broken valve stem leaving a 1/2 inch diameter hole where chlorine gas may be discharged during a fifteen minute accidental release from a full cylinder. The scenario also assumes that"

      "SummaryText": " this is a two-phase release of both liquid chlorine and gaseous chlorine. This scenario releases 1,500 pounds of chlorine gas in fifteen minutes. The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be 0.20 miles from the chlorination facility assuming a wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour and an atmospheric rating of \"Class D\". The endpoint determination includes enclosure of the cylinder within the storage room. The potential population affected by the alternate release scenario was estimated to be 200 persons.\n\nActuation of the Chlorine Gas Detectors is considered to be an active mitigation measure. Additionally, the chlorine gas piping is vacuum tubing connected directly to the chlorine cylinders. A loss of vacuum in the tubing immediately stops the flow of chlorine gas from the cylinders and virtually eliminates the possibility of a chlorine release due a piping leak. The Salem Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a Chlorine Gas Scrubber, which is also considered to be an active mitigation measure.\n\nThe Salem Water Treatment Plant RMP has the key elements listed below. These elements are aimed at preventing a chlorine release from the chlorination system.\n\n* High level of operator training and maintenance training;\n* An established preventive maintenance program;\n* Implementation of an audit and inspection program;\n* Use of effective written operating procedures;\n* Implementation of an employee participation program;\n* Use of emergency air supply and cylinder leak kits;\n* Use a of chlorine gas scrubber;\n* Performance of process hazard analysis and compliance auditing procedures;\n* Use of process alarms and emergency shut down procedures;\n* Annual chlorine safety training by the chlorine supplier; and \n* Quarterly demonstration and practice sessions using emergency air supply.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine gas have occurred at the Salem Water Treatment Plant in the past five years. \n\nAn emergency response plan is established and is coordinated with the City of Salem "
