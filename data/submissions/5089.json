      "SummaryText": "\nIntroduction\n\nUSEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP rule applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under '68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA PSM standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe Lafayette Water Works Canal Road  Station utilizes more than the threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in '68.150 by June 21, 1999 (three years after publication of the final rule). Since public employees are covered under the state-delegated OSHA program, the Canal Road  Station is subject to the OSHA PSM standard and is therefore subject to Program 3 requirements.  \n\nUSEPA's RMP rule requires that covered facilities prepare an executive summary.  The following pages represent the executive summary, summarizing the items required as described in '68.155 (a) through (g).\n\n\n'68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of the Lafayette Water Works chlorination systems, the Lafayette Water Works depends on the commitment and team effort of their employees and suppliers. \n\nThe Lafayette Water Works has established a Prevention Program to ensure th"

The Prevention Plan contains safety information relating to chlorine and the chlorination system and establishes standard protocols for items such as system operations, maintenance, system changes, contractor safety, and incident investigation.  The Prevention Plan also describes training for employees on the safe operation of the chlorination systems. \n\nLafayette Water Works facilities are equipped with ambient chlorine detectors and audible alarms.  The ton cylinders are equipped with vacuum regulators, through which chlorine gas flows to the injector under vacuum.  Loss of vacuum causes the vacuum-regulating valve to automatically shut off the gas supply at the source.  \n\nAll potential releases from Lafayette Water Works facilities will be responded to by the Lafayette Fire Department, whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine at the facilities and trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n\n'68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Canal Road  Station facility. The Canal Road  Station facility uses two 1-ton chlorine containers connected in parallel to supply chlorine to the pumped water.  These containers are located inside a building.  One container is isolated by a vacuum automatic transfer valve. An additional one to two 1-ton containers, which may be empty or full, are stored inside the building.  \nGaseous chlorine from the 1-ton containers is drawn by a vacuum to a chlorinator located inside the building. After being metered at the chlorinator, the gaseous chlorine is mixed with treated water (pumped to provide a higher pressure for injection) to form a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then injected into well water, which is is then distributed to Lafayette Water Works customers.\n\n'68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the rule, a worst case and altern"

For the Canal Road  Station facility the worst-case scenario is a release from one of the 1-ton containers (greatest amount held in a single vessel) of chlorine. It is assumes that the container ruptures and its contents escape to the ground in ten minutes.  The worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.  It was assumed that the release occurred outside, and no mitigation measures were incorporated into the evaluation.   The reference tables in the USEPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants were used to determine the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario.  The toxic endpoint distance indicated that residential areas, parks, schools and a hospital could be impacted by a worst case release.\n\nThe facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario considered was completed in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The alternative release scenario involved the shearing-off or some other significant damage to the 5/16 inch valve of the 1-ton container.  It is assumed that this tank damage occurs inside the building, and the mitigation provided by the building was incorporated into the evaluation.  As with the worst case scenario, the reference tables in USEPAs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the toxic endpoint, and the resulting toxic endpoint predicted potential off-site impacts.\n\n\n'68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Plan describes measures taken at the Lafayette Water Works facilities to prevent releases.  The Lafayette Water Works has a Prevention Program for the chlorine systems, which is documented in the Prevention Plan.

The emergency response procedures are outlined in the Lafayette Water Works Emergency Response Plan.  Lafayette Water Works facilities are equipped with chlorine detectors with audible alarms.  The chlorine processes are equipped with vacuum regulators, which terminate flow if a release occurs.  A SCADA system sends an alarm signal via computer and telephone to the Lafayette Water Works office and on-call personnel.  \n\n\n'68.155(g) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) in June of 1999 by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc.  Lafayette Water Works will evaluate these recommendations and implement recommendations as appropriate."
