Emergency Response \r\nFBC's emergency action plan details the procedures for notification, alarm, response, and evacuation of FBC's employees due to an ammonia release or other natural disaster.  FBC's Emergency Action Plan has also been coordinated with the Region 5/6 Local Emergency Planning Coordinator and the Fremont Fire Department.  It recognizes the Fremont Fire Department and their affiliates at the Bellevue Fire Department as the responders to a significant release. \r\n \r\n6. Process Safety Improvements or Planned Changes to Improve Safety \r\nFBC regularly participates in safety training and safety reviews offered by the Nebraska Safety Council.  FBC also hosts the local Fire Department to facility walk-throughs, receives annual insurance carrier facility safety inspections, conducts third party audits to identify potential improvements, conducts regular pipe integrity testing, and offers FBC employees awareness and refresher level training.  FBC has also made improvements by installing a new refrigeration system that requires far less anhydrous ammonia than a traditional system.  This technology greatly reduces the amount of ammonia that must be handled and stored on-site thus providing a safer work environment.  This Risk Management Plan and the information used to prepare it are made readily available to all FBC employees."

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\nFremont Beef Company (FBC) is a responsible member of the community and is committed to operating its facility in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  FBC will utilize its Risk Management Program to help identify ways to reduce the use of anhydrous ammonia and minimize potential risks to its employees, the community, and environment.  FBC will comply with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; identify, report, and promptly correct unsafe conditions; train personnel to safely perform their job duties; and work to maintain a safe workplace.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\r\nFBC has implemented a Level 3 Risk Management Program to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from its plant at 960 South Schneider Street in Fremont, Nebraska.  At this location, FBC processes and vacuum packs fresh beef products for distribution to domestic food service companies and export abroad.  The process relies on chillers to keep the food products cold during preparation, packaging and storage.  The chillers and refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the coolant in quantities exceeding EPA's regulatory threshold.  \r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nFBC relies on several safeguards as part of it accidental release prevention program.  FBC's design engineers and suppliers use recognized design codes and standards for the equipment and system components.  The plant's standard operating procedures specify safe practices to be used at the plant and the maintenance program establishes proper testing, calibration, and cleaning procedures.  Also hazard communication is encouraged between management, operators, and employees during the process hazard analysis, process safety information reviews, training, safety briefings, and procedure reviews. \r\n \r\n4. Five Year Accident History\r\nOver the past five year"
