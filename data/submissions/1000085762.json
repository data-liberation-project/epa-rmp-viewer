The Valence Hay Butte site has had no process related accidents in its history.\r\n\r\nValence has a developed emergency response plan for this site. The first level of response is engineered safety systems e.g. equipment shuts downs due to vibration, levels or pressures or gas detection all which shuts down the equipment in a safe state. Where incidents may escape from engineered designs, they are managed by engineered mitigation systems e.g. pressure safety reliefs or relief systems to the shared flare. If an emergency were ever to extend beyond these cases, Valence works with Caliber to protect workers through evacuation plans.\r\n\r\nValence has identified that most scenarios identified within the modelling are very unlikely either requiring a sudden and complete failure of a vessel or a pool fire beneath one. To ensure these are not credible, Valence maintains a vessel and mechanical integrity program for equi"
