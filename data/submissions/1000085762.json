Valence is committed to providing and maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all employees, customers, partners, contractors, suppliers and members of the public.\n\n\n\nValence is committed to reduce the potential for unsafe situations by developing, implementing and maintaining an Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response Programs and works with the local community.\n\n\n\nThe Valence Haye Butte facility is tied closely with it partner Caliber Midstream. The Valence facility is composed of two operations, both located at the Caliber Hay Butte Gas Plant, within the plant boundary\n\n?    the Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Upgrading Facility; and \n\n?    the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Facility.\n\n\n\nThe NGL facility recovers natural gas liquids which is primarily propane although may contain small quantities of ethane or butane.\n\nThe CNG facility takes methane and compresses it for transportation.\n\n\n\nValence Hay Butte facility went into operation in December of 2019. The Valence Hay Butte site has had no process related accidents in its history.\n\n\n\nValence has a developed emergency response plan for this site. The first level of response is engineered safety systems e.g. equipment shuts downs due to vibration, levels or pressures or gas detection all which shuts down the equipment in a safe state. Where incidents may escape from engineered designs, they are managed by engineered mitigation systems e.g. pressure safety reliefs or relief systems to the shared flare. If an emergency were ever to extend beyond these cases, Valence works with Caliber to protect workers through evacuation plans.\n\n\n\nValence has identified that most scenarios identified within the modelling are very unlikely either requiring a sudden and complete failure of a vessel or a pool fire beneath one. To ensure these are not credible, Valence maintains a vessel and mechanical integrity program for equi"

Sloping of the yard has been engineered to prevent pooling.\n\n\n\nFor the case reviewed where a vehicle drives away damaging hoses Valence mitigates this by:\n\n?    trained and competent operators and drivers, \n\n?    transport fill systems are designed to shut down on low pressure in the case of a leak, \n\n?    fill systems are designed to shut down on LEL detected in the area, \n\n?    lights and indicators at truck loading stations verifying grounding and valve positioning,\n\n?    ESD stations at truck loading, and \n\n?    CNG trailers loading equipped with RFID tags that prevent overloading of a trailer.\n\n\n\nWith these controls and systems in place, Valence believes that it poses little risk to workers or the environment due to process safety incidents.\n\n\n\n"
