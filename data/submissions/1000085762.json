The Valence facility is composed of two operations, both located at the Caliber Hay Butte Gas Plant, within the plant boundary\n\n?    the Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Upgrading Facility; and \n\n?    the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Facility.\n\n\n\nThe NGL facility recovers natural gas liquids which is primarily propane although may contain small quantities of ethane or butane.\n\nThe CNG facility takes methane and compresses it for transportation.\n\n\n\nValence Hay Butte facility went into operation in December of 2019. The Valence Hay Butte site has had no process related accidents in its history.\n\n\n\nValence has a developed emergency response plan for this site. The first level of response is engineered safety systems e.g. equipment shuts downs due to vibration, levels or pressures or gas detection all which shuts down the equipment in a safe state. Where incidents may escape from engineered designs, they are managed by engineered mitigation systems e.g. pressure safety reliefs or relief systems to the shared flare. If an emergency were ever to extend beyond these cases, Valence works with Caliber to protect workers through evacuation plans.\n\n\n\nValence has identified that most scenarios identified within the modelling are very unlikely either requiring a sudden and complete failure of a vessel or a pool fire beneath one. To ensure these are not credible, Valence maintains a vessel and mechanical integrity program for equi"
