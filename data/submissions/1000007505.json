Written policies exist to address policy requirements from OSHA (e.g., Hazard Communication & MSDS, Lockout Tagout, Confined Space Entry Procedures, Emergency Action Plans, Hot Work Permitting, Line Break Permitting, Ammonia System Line Break Permitting, and PSM).  In addition a written contractor safety program is in place.\n\n\n\nSenior management has appointed a PSM Coordinator to monitor and maintain overall compliance with the OSHA PSM Program.  The Refrigeration Manager oversees and maintains the EPA RMP program.  These two individuals work in close cooperation to maintain an effective program to reduce hazards and promote safe operations.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe stationary source subect to this RMP is Cargill's turkey processing facility located in Springdale, Arkansas.  The regulated substance that is the subject of this RMP is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures, Operator Training, Procedures for maintaining Mechanical Integrity, procedures for managing system changes (MOC), Pre-Start up Safety Review procedures, procedures for Incident Investigation, and Hot Work permitting procedures.  This program was developed, and is maintained with the participation of the affected employees. The program is perio"

In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administrative controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIn the previous five years, this facility has had one accidental release of ammonia which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.   On February 6th 2012 a 13,655 lb release of anhydrous ammonia, during a 6-1/2 hour period,  resulted in the evacuation of the plant. \n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which addresses accidental releases of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Springdale Fire Department.  The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan.  The facility has an inhouse hazmat team which trains regularly and maintains compliance with OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 1910.120.    \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis was performed on 2/24/2010.  Action Items resulting from the 2008 PHA, the 2008 PSM Audit, as well as the 2008 Mechanical Integrity Inspection are tracked to monitor progress, and completion.  Some of the planned changes include installation of additional elevated work platforms where the need has been identified, and automatic ventilation of the Heat Exchanger room. The facility continues to monitor and maintain it's PSM/RMP program through an organized PSM team chartered to ensure all elements of the PSM/RMP rpogram are in place.\n\n"
