Employees responded to a hypothetical chlorine release that triggered the chlorine alarm.  Upon completion of the evacuation exercise the District Hazmat team conducted a training exercise using an empty chlorine cylinder on location.   \nThe Commission activates the chlorine alarm at least annually to test the employee and contractor response.  The Refresher on Operating Procedures is completed annually for Operations staff.  \nStarting in 2007 the facility instituted an Emergency Response Training Program to instruct facility personnel in National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS) Training.  Personnel are trained to the NIMS IS-700 and ICS 100 level.  Supervisory personnel have been trained to the ICS-200 level and key Managers to the ICS 300 level.  Monthly communications drills are conducted between facility control room staff and the Westfield 911 center via a two-way radio.\nThe Commission's Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) ensures that maintenance is completed by the scheduled generation of work orders on all critical equipment.  Daily inspections are conducted for chlorine piping, valves and injectors.  Ongoing maintenance includes monthly building checklists and chlorine alarm testing.  All cylinder regulators are rebuilt and recertified by the manufacturer on an annual basis.   The backup power generator at West Parish Filters is sized to provide power to all equipment related to the chlorine process."

      "SummaryText": "eral accident release program is comprised of several interrelated elements.  The operators have received a high level of training through on-the-job instruction, attendance of appropriate mandatory courses and seminars, and a mandatory certified on-site refresher course given by the facility's chlorine supplier vendor at least every three years.  The operators follow a preventative maintenance program to avert sudden equipment breakdowns.  Written operating procedures are available to the operators.  The most recent hazard review of equipment and review of safety procedures was performed in 2022.  Full face respirators are worn by facility personnel during cylinder change outs.  Training is conducted for all on-site employees concerning the awareness of the hazardous properties of chlorine and for the chlorine sensor alarm systems which incorporate both audible and visual alarms at the storage site as well as the plant's main computer alarm system.  The Commission recently replaced all PVC piping in the chlorine building and added new chlorine scales in 2022.   Programming for a loss of signal alarm and upgrade to one leak detection alarm was completed in August of 2022.  The second leak detection alarm was upgraded in February of 2023 after a delay in shipment of a necessary relay.   Previously a loss of signal would have activated the chlorine alarm and falsely caused personnel to evacuate.  \nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the facility in the previous five years (June 2019 to June 2024).\nThe treatment plant has an emergency action plan which provides both plant and community response personnel contact numbers.  The Westfield Fire Department conducts annual site visits to review and update its emergency information.  The Westfield Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Westfield Health Department are provided a copy of this plan.  \nThe most recent joint emergency response exercise was held on May 31, 2023 to review and practice the Commi"

      "SummaryText": "The Springfield Water and Sewer Commission (Commission) has prepared and updated this accident release prevention program in response to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule as promulgated and amended (January 13, 2017 - 82 FR 4696) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Commission has followed the procedures set forth in the rule and utilized guidance materials provided by EPA.  In addition, an emergency action plan relating to an accidental chlorine release at the West Parish Filters (WPF) Drinking Water Treatment Plant outlines emergency action procedures at the plant and coordination with local emergency response services.\n The stationary source this RMP applies to is the chlorination facility located at the WPF Drinking Water Treatment Plant in Westfield, Massachusetts.  The RMP regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine which is used for primary disinfection of the finished drinking water.  The chlorine building is comprised of two separate rooms: (1) a chlorine handling room containing six one-ton cylinders with vacuum regulators, scales, electric hoist, chlorine gas sensor alarms, and manual ventilation system; and (2) a chlorination room housing chlorinators, a chlorine gas sensor alarm and feed water pipes.  A secure pad adjacent to the building provides space for additional inventory and empty cylinder storage.  \nThe chlorination process at the WPF has historically been considered an EPA RMP Program 2 Level process because WPF employees were not subject to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards (29 CFR 1910.119) through the United States Department of Labor.  However, with the enactment of Massachusetts bill H.3952 as of February 1, 2019, public sector employees are now required to meet the minimum requirements provided under OSHA through oversight and enforcement by the Massachusetts Department of Labor Standards (DLS), so the covered process now falls under RMP Program Level 3.  \nThe gen"
