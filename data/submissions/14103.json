If a accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authories, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\nthe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authoried contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 120,000 lbs. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 lbs., which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\nthe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L fir the worst-case scenario is 1 mile.\n\nThe alterrnative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release frol a break in a transfer hose.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario ir .19 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidential Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nThere have beenno accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia inthe past five years that:\n"
