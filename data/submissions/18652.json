Tanks were moved to this location from others.  This plan is marked \"Predictive\" because this plan must be filed prior to loading the tanks and beginning operations.\n\nThe 11/01/99 dates are used in various areas of this plan to represent that the completion date of preparations to start operation.  The required activities may not have been performed no that date, but were completed by that date.  There are no employees permanently assigned to this location, so training conducted in the spring of 1999 is current for this operation.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nPassive release prevention efforts include placement of storage tanks, and the odorants put into these products by the manufactures.  All bulk storage tanks are located in a locked fenced area away from the flow of any traffic.  \n\nActive prevention measures include inspection of all tanks annually, at the end of the season.  All required repairs are completed prior to further use.  Further inspections are preformed semi-annually by the Missouri Department of Agriculture.\n\nEmergency response policies are as described below.\n\nFACILTIY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis facility is located 0.7 miles south of the town of La Monte, Missouri.  It is adjacent to an abandoned missile silo.  Therefore, in its previous use, there had to be significant clear space around this location.  This facility has one bulk anhydrous ammonia tank, and one bulk LPG tank.  Each tank has a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the ammonia operation envisions a catastrophic failure of the storage tank, possibly preceded by failure of the safety relief valve.  Regulatory and procedural"

      "SummaryText": " controls limit the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the tank to approximately 85% to 88% of capacity.  Using RMP*COMP, the toxic endpoint calculated to be 6.9 miles.  This would the town of La Monte, and its immediate surrounding area.  The same type of failure could occur with the LP tank.  In the presence of an ignition source, this could lead to a vapor cloud explosion.  The endpoint for this event was calculated to be 0.4 miles.\n\nAlternative release scenarios for both products involve hose being broken or damaged, allowing product release.  The release of the LPG in the presence of an ignition source would also result in a vapor cloud explosion.  Both of these events could occur only in conjunction with failure of the excess flow valves.  The toxic endpoint for an anhydrous ammonia release is 1.6 miles, and for the propane is 0.2 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe facility complies with both 29CFR 1910.111 (Anhydrous Ammonia) and NFPA 58 (Propane).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDNET HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving release of anhydrous ammonia or LP gas in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility is located outside of La Monte Missouri.  Employees will notify the fire department in the event of a major release.  The General Manager and other designated employees are authorized to take appropriate actions to sop small releases by shutting off valves, etc.  Other employees will notify the fire department, and evacuate the area as necessary.  There is a written emergency response plan in place that is for the use of, and apples only to, company employees.  This plan includes evacuation procedures, who is authorized to take emergency actions to control a release, notification and alarm procedures, and other necessary information.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThere are currently no changes to the safety/release prevention programs planned."
