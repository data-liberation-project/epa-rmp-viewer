We are located in the petroleum and chemical industry and removed from residential areas.\n\nStorage Warehouse Services Inc. has the ability to store Corrosive, Flammable Liquid, Flammable Solids, Combustibles, Poisonous, Oxidizers and Organic Peroxides.\n\nWe utilize drum grabbers that can handle two,four or eight drums. Storage accommodates drums, bags, pails, super sacks, gaylords etc.We do not store aerosol products.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO based on the RMP Comp \n\nRelease of BF3 to the atmosphere creates a dense, white cloud. Although BF3 is heavier than air, the thermal effect of heating when BF3 reacts with water vapor in the air causes the cloud to become buoyant. It has a sharp acidic odor.\n\nA release can happen with a defective valve cap. A release of 544 pounds at a release rate of 29.9 pounds per minute for 10 minutes from an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air can travel an estimated 1.3 miles. This is in a rural surrounding. \n\nNo specific BF3 leak detecting or analysis devices are yet available. Warehouses must use methods such as awareness, our eyes and odor detection.\n\nSpotting a vapor cloud at a distance or detecting a odor, the warehouse employees will sound the order for immediate evacuation, cutting off ignition sources,closing the fire doors and calling the Fire Department could possibly slow down the travel distance. \n\nWith consistent monitoring by all employees and container pressure checks hopefully a release will be detected in time to confine the release to its storage area until our local responders arrive. It is a 5 min. response time for our local fire department.\n\nTraining will continue covering safe storage and handling procedures for this product. In addition to our existing natural air changes, mechanical high and low ventilation is provided by industrial fans and the use of roof mounted upblast power ventilators with back draft dampers provide a minim"

Open Dialogue with the La Porte LEPC at our monthly meetings will be on going.\n\nStoring this product with cross ventilation that causes natural air changes and the use of our local mechanical exhaust ventilation should help to dissipate some of the vapors. Keeping this product out of direct sunlight, away from flammable and corrosive materials along with safe handling should make the worse case scenario unlikely. Safe handling includes proper forklift handling, not tampering with the valve or valve safety device and close monitoring of the stored temperature.\n\n ALTERNATE SCENARIO based on the RMP Comp\n\nA release of BF3 vapor cloud at the rate of 10 pounds per minute for 10 minutes in an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air in a rural surrounding will travel an estimated distance of 0.1 miles.\n\nOnce again, spotting a vapor cloud or odor detection, the warehouse employees will sound the order for immediate evacuation, cutting off ignition sources,closing the fire doors and calling the Fire Department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nStorage Warehouse Services Inc. has not had an accidental reportable release in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nStorage Warehouse Services has an Emergency Action Plan.
