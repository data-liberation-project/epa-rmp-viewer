The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain, by gravity, into the high pressure receivers.

Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n(2) Precoolers\r\n(8) Rooms\r\n\r\n1.2.2 Facility Location\r\n\r\nSunview Cold Storage Earlimart is located at 315 N. Front St. Earlimart, CA 93219. The latitude and longitude of the largest high pressure receiver is 35.886490, -119.274518. The facility is located approximately 500 feet west of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\r\n\r\nFlood Hazards\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in an area of minimal flood hazard.\r\n\r\nSeismic Susceptibility\r\nSunview Cold Storage Earlimart is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps showed that faults within close proximity are not considered high risk:\r\nPond Fault - <150 Years\r\nPoso Creek Fault - <1,600,000 Years\r\nUnnamed Faults - <1,600,000 Years\r\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Sunview Cold Storage Earlimart has a 1-2% chance of experiencing potentially minor-damage due to ground shaking in 2018.\r\n\r\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\r\n\r\nFlooded System\r\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\n\r\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access.

      "SummaryText": "1. Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a living document. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sunview Cold Storage - Earlimart has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Sunview Cold Storage - Earlimart, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sunview Cold Storage - Earlimart has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration         Anhydrous Ammonia                22,000\r\n \r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.
