Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt this distribution facility, we store chlorine, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity chemical also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n   2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to store chlorine for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry. Chlorine is received in 150 pound cylinders and 2,000 pound containers and are shipped in the same packages.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 109,200 pounds.  Average inventory is much less.\n\n   3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of a 2,000 pound container of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released and vaporized in 10 minutes.  The distan"

This scenario is unlikely but provides a reasonable basis for emergency planning purposes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (as determined by RMP Comp) is 0.30 miles.\n\n   4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n   5. Five-year accident history\n\nWithin the past five years, this facility has had two accidents that qualified to be reported as part of the Risk Management Plan.  \n\nDuring the first incident, a small release (2 pounds) caused local responders to evacuate businesses and to shut down Highway 109 for a brief time as a precaution.\n\nDuring the second incident a 150 pound release caused damage to the leaves of trees off site.  The trees recovered from the exposure to chlorine.\n\n   6. The emergency response program\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We have discussed this program with Thomasville Fire Department.  A representative of the Thomasville Fire Department visited this plant on May 12, 1999.\n\n   7.Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1970.  We continue to participate in the Chlorine Institute and National Association of Chemical Distributors programs, and continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Process gui"
