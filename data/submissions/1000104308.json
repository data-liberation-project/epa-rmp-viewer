The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Simmons Foods, Inc. strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets, both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Siloam Springs Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n2.\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3.\tTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO's.\n\nThis location has prepared a worst case release and an alternate case release scenario by using RMPComp air dispersion modeling software. We also used MARPLOT for mapping the distance to the toxic end point. \n\nDocumentation of these s"
