The Jackson LP Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Jackson, MI.   The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low sulfur diesel/#2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\nJackson LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. MPLX believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. MPLX promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that MPLX has designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\nC.

Jackson LP Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Butane Tank Blending Process.\n\nThe Butane Tank Blending is a batch type process based on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports) and piped directly to and injected into the gasoline recirculation line associated with the product tank to be blended. Process safety controls include a skid emergency shutoff valve with multiple, manual actuators and fusible element along with a \"Smart-Hose\", low emission hose coupler, and thermal/hydrostatic reliefs. Access to the Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Jackson LP Terminal accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning/response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Terminal:\n\n1) Employee Participation;\n2) Process Safety Information;\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA);\n4) Standard Operating Procedures;\n5) Training;\n6) Contractors;\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review;\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance;\n9) Hazardous Work Permits/Procedures;\n10)Management of Change;\n11)Incident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation;"

In addition to the training noted above, MPLX also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help identify/contain/control a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n-Redundant control systems;\n-Manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of safety devices;\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation\n\n-Process and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantity (also actuated via a fusible element);\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks; and\n-\"Smart-Hose\" with design break-away and self-closing valves on each end.\n\nGeneral Emergency Response\n\n-Emergency alert system;\n-Periodic emergency training for employees;\n-Communication systems with local emergency responders and regulatory agencies; and\n-Emergency drills with Terminal personnel, regulatory agencies, and community emergency responders to enhance response skills and coordination among agencies.\n\nFurther, the Terminal's regulated process complies with the National Fire Protec"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, a Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP)/\"SmartPlan\" is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with Blackman-Leoni Department of Public Safety.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Jackson LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal maintains records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated, follow-up actions. This is a \"newly regulated\" process; consequently, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulations.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Blackman-Leoni Department of Public Safety and Jackson County Emergency Management. An Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP)/\"SmartPlan\" is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the butane tank blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Blackman-Leoni Department of Public Safety and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and 1st Responder Operations capability.\n\nThe Blackman-Leoni Department of Public Safety participates in annual butane training sessions for this system.\n\nE.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMPLX is continually striving to make the Jackson LP Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors, and community.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, MPLX actively seeks employee input on process safety improvements.
