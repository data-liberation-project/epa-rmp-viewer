Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the freezing process. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat. It is normally shipped as a liquefied compressed gas and is present in portions of the refrigeration system as a liquid under pressure. Please refer to onsite data for ammonia quantities.\n\nThe Paterson plant is located in a highly rural area with virtually no residential properties within the toxic endpoint distance for any ammonia release which would be likely to occur. A moderately busy highway (U.S. HWY.14) runs in an east-west direction within a few hundred yards of the WBFF facility.\n\nIn order to protect its employees, the public, and the environment, WBFF is developing an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. This program is contained in a comprehensive web-based format designed to comply with WISHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards found in WAC 296-67 and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68. This safety management website is currently under construction with all elements scheduled to be in place by 12/31/04. When completed, the website will be a valuable tool through which WBFF will be able to document any changes in safety or emergency procedures immediately upon their adoption.   \n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the WBFF processing plant.\n\nThe Paterson plant has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  Any leak is easily detected through the plant ammonia detection equipment, and WBFF maintains a staff of  operations and maintenance personnel who are trained and qualified"

In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Paterson fire department, and the Benton County Disaster Services Coordinator to assist in the response.  Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\nThe Paterson plant has experienced only infrequent minor releases that have never been detected beyond the plant boundaries.  During the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia."
