The compression was brought on-line in January 16, 2001.  The process was brought on line May 2001. The facility is manned 10 hours daily. \n\n\n\nLow pressure inlet gas (currently approximately 9.5 MMscfd) enters the facility from two CHK gathering systems.  The high side, Leslie County #1 & #2, is delivered to the plant via an 8\" pipeline at approximately 75 psig. The low side, Clay County #1 & #2, is delivered to the plant via an 8\" pipeline at approximately 7 psig.  The gas is compressed by two identical Natural Gas Engine drive reciprocating gas compressors to process pressure of approximately 350 psig.  The gas is dehydrated using Tri-ethylene Glycol (TEG) prior to entering the propane refrigeration stripper portion of the process.  \n\n\n\nOverhead vapors (residue gas) from the stripper portion of the process with a volume of 8.5 MMscfd is delivered through two (2) outlets to the Columbia Gas Transmission Pipeline (KA1) and the Somerset Manchester 8.  Liquids leaving the stripper portion of the process flow to the storage area of the facility. \n\n    \n\nThe facility produces approximately 6000 gallons a day of Butanes plus (Propane/Butane mix) product stream with a composition of 2 % Ethane, 35.2 % Propane, 9% iso-Butane, 27.7% n-Butane, 7% iso-pentane and 9% n-Pentane.  The balance of the fluid mix is heavy ends commonly known as C6 plus (Hexane, Heptane, Octane and Nonane). Ethane, Propane, iso-Butane, n-Butane iso-Pentane and n-Pentane are regulated substances each with a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nBecause of the volume of stored regulated substances vs. the transient gas stream, only the storage area was evaluated when determining RMP eligibility or Program level.  The interconnecting piping would make the refrigeration plant part of the \"process\" but the requireme"

The facility then produces into the 30,000 gallon tank while the others are being shipped by truck. Procedurally, the facility is limited to 50,000 gallons on-site storage and this amount was used when evaluating the Worst Case Scenario.\n\n\n\n \n\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nWe used RMP*Comp and calculated a mixture of flammable substance stream as:\n\n  Ethane as 2% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 3.11 lbs per/gallon = 3,110 lbs\n\n  Propane as 35.2% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 4.224 lbs per/gallon = 74,342 lbs\n\n  iso-Butane as 9% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 4.685 lbs per/gallon = 15,226 lbs.\n\n  n-Butane as 27.7% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 4.865 lbs per/gallon = 67,380 lbs.\n\n  iso-Pentane as 7% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 5.194 lbs per/gallon = 18,179 lbs.\n\n  n-Pentane as 9% of 50,000 gallons multiplied by 5.248 lbs per/gallon = 23,616 lbs.\n\nTOTAL = 201,854 lbs\n\n\n\nThis gave us a worst case scenario (Worst Case assumes the entire contents were released and formed a vapor cloud which detonated) distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi of 0.5 miles.  There are approximately 7 homes with an estimated 21 residents within the 0.5 mile radius of Oneida Extraction Plant.  A ridge line on either side of the facility protects all but one of these residents from impact of a vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\nThe Alternate release scenario involves a Pull-Away explosion of a driver failing to remove the hose while loading.
