      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nLinconlway Energy, LLC's (LWE) chemical accident prevention and emergency response policies for ammonia and denaturant (flammable mixture) involve the development of this Risk Management Program and Plan (RMP) which has a primary objective of preventing an accidental release of ammonia and flammable mixture, and minimizing the consequences of a release should one occur. \n\nLWE has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  Senior management has appointed a Safety Manager to monitor and maintain overall compliance with both OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP regulations.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled: \nLincolnway Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located in Nevada, Story County, Iowa.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia, and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline) which is a flammable mixture.\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 162,000 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud or release 1,168,100 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nFor ammonia, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 6.9 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, schools and other public receptors are located within this 6.9 mile radius.\n\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.4 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this 0.4 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Lincoln"

      "SummaryText": "way Energy, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.  Due to the amount of ammonia, and denaturant stored on site, LWE would be considered a Program 3.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \nThe prevention program for LWE includes employee training, contractor evaluation and training, regular maintenance, and communication with local emergency responders.  LWE considers accidental release prevention when changes are made to any covered process, when contractors are used onsite, or when changes in procedures take place. \n\n\nThe following elements are required for a program 3 prevention program.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\n\u00c2\u00bf\tTraining\n\u00c2\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\n\u00c2\u00bf\tCompliance Audit\n\u00c2\u00bf\tManagement of Change\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPre-Startup Review\n\u00c2\u00bf\tContractors\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\n\u00c2\u00bf\tHot Work Permits\n\nThese elements are addressed in the PSM Program for LWE, as required by OSHA's standard (29 CFR 1910.119).   The Risk Management Program will be updated periodically and changes will be recorded.  Changes to activities and covered process will be communicated with affected employees, contractors used on site, and local emergency responders.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  \nIn the previous five years, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  \nThis facility has developed an Emergency Actio"

      "SummaryText": "n Plan (EAP) which addresses accidental releases of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Ames Fire Department. However, LWE provides annual training to its employees for responding to accidental material releases, and thus does not rely on the Ames Fire Department for primary emergency response.  This training was last updated in March of 2011.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  \nThe most recent process hazard analysis (PHA) was performed on March 14th, 2011.  The last Management of Change review was conducted in June of 2011.  The facility continues to monitor and maintain its PSM/RMP program through an organized PSM team chartered to ensure all elements of the PSM/RMP program are in place.  The last review of the facility Emergency Response Plan took place on June 2011."
