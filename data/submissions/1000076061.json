Fresh Mark Cold Storage's directors, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. Fresh Mark Cold Storage has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances. In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases. The Emergency Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation. Fresh Mark Cold Storage coordinates with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nFresh Mark Cold Storage is a refrigerated warehouse facility. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the ammonia refrigeration system to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various areas of the facility. The refrigeration system is a closed loop system and is comprised of various refrigeration components including compressors, evaporators, vessels, pumps, heat exchangers and condensers. The ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are high and low pressure and level automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur. The ammonia refrigeration system is monitored by a computerized system. Each system is linked to a twenty-four hours a day third-party alarm monitoring company.  \n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nFresh Mark Cold Storage has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.
