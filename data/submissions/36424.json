At the time the power failed, the KNC bullet inlet valve closed as designed.  The valve on the Magellan Pipeline, from which ammonia is received, did not fully close.  Flow continued after the power failure resulting in high pressure in the Garner Terminal piping.  As a result, the relief valve on the discharge line of the cold pump opened (as designed to relieve under high pressure conditions) releasing ammonia into the atmosphere and on to the ground.  Approximately 12,320 pounds of ammonia was released.  One resident was evacuated located 0.25-mile south of the facility, as a precautionary measure.    No other offsite impacts occurred.  There were no onsite injuries or death; however, soil removal and replacement at the facility cost approximately $40,000.  As a result of this incident, some process indicators were tied into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System to monitor the facility from a central control room.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe terminal will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Garner Terminal with the Garner Volunteer Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Hancock County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the Mercy Health Center in Mason City, Alliant Electric, and the Iowa State Highway Patrol.  The Garner Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.

KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Garner Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by pipeline and stored until it is loaded on trucks for distribution.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Garner Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Propane is stored at the facility; however, it is used strictly as a fuel and as such is exempt from RMP reporting.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00b7Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulatio"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7Minimizing the possibility of overfilling by having level gauges and high pressure alarms on storage tanks and bullets.\n\u00b7Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n\u00b7Requiring trucks to have a brake interlock system that helps prevent a truck driver from driving away before the loading arm is properly disconnected.\n\u00b7Providing annual truck loading training to ensure driver safety.\n\u00b7Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\u00b7Monitoring the level of liquid ammonia in the bullet on a continuous basis.\n\u00b7Loading of trucks occurs only when KNC personnel are on site and can monitor activities.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History  \n\nThe Garner Terminal has had one incident occur during the last five years that is reportable in the five-year accident history maintained under the RMP regulations.
