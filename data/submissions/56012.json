It includes required actions by facility employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe facility consists of inlet mechanical filters and separators, an inlet gas compressor, a refrigerant compressor, a skid-mounted refrigeration natural gas processing unit, three NGL (natural gas liquids) pressure vessel storage tanks, a condensate stabilizer, a natural gas condensate pressure storage tank, one atmospheric used oil tank, one atmospheric waste water tank, a flare, and two fired heaters.  Facility inlet piping is 6? and outlet piping is 4?.\n\nThe facility receives raw natural gas from several nearby gas wells. The function of the facility is to remove liquids from the wellhead gas prior to injection of the gas into an interstate gas pipeline system. Liquids are first removed by mechanical separation. The raw gas is then compressed.  Water is then removed from the gas via glycol dehydration, and finally NGLs are removed from the gas by way of a propane refrigeration process. The processed natural gas is then injected into the interstate gas pipeline. The NGLs are stored onsite in three pressure vessel storage tanks for removal by truck as needed. Natural gas condensate is stored in a low pressure storage tank for removal by truck as needed.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Pre"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform facility\npersonnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR?s): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.  \n\nMechanical Integrity: Stewart Dew Point Control Facility has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent system"

The overall emergency response program for Stewart Dew Point Control Facility will be coordinated with the Mount Pleasant Volunteer Fire Department.  The Stewart Dew Point Control Facility has 24-hour communications capability with the Mount Pleasant Volunteer Fire Department through the local 911 system. The Facility is in the process of coordinating periodic emergency drills that involve the Mount Pleasant Volunteer Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe Stewart Facility is in the process of evaluating and implementing the recommendations from the most recent Process Hazard Analysis.  These recommendations include engineering reviews of piping specifications and process control logic, the installation of additional process controls and modifications to operating procedures. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with this process."
