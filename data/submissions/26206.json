The facility is regulated under RMP due to on-site Boron Triflouride storage in excess of the RMP applicability threshold of 2,500 pounds.  Boron Triflouride is used as a catalyst for chemical manufacturing. Boron Triflouride is stored in a 7 Tube, Tube Trailer with a capacity of 3525 pounds each. \n\nChemical Safety Overview:  The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, procedure and maintenance systems already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for Boron Triflouride in response to the RMP requirements.  The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (OSHA PSM Standard and US EPA 40 CFR 68).\n\nRelease Scenarios:  Worst-case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted for the facility's single largest vessel based on US EPA's RMP Comp Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance.  The worst-case release scenario for Boron Triflouride is a 10-minute gaseous ground release of 3,525 pounds of Boron Triflouride and the alternate release scenario is a 60 minute gaseous release of 3,525 pounds of Boron Triflouride.  Public receptors were determined to be located within the impact zone of both the worst-case and alternative releases.  The resulting worst-case and alternative release impact zones were 1.9 miles and 0.5 miles, respectively.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:  Due to our excellent accident release pre"

      "SummaryText": "vention programs, Gulbrandsen has had not had any reportable accident/release of any chemicals within the five years proceeding RMP submittal.  \n\nPrevention Program:  The facility has implemented a Program Level 3 Prevention Program for Boron Triflouride, as required by the RMP rule, in accordance with the US EPA guidance.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequence of any accidental Boron Triflouride release from the facility and include such measures as process hazards analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup safety, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.  The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The facility's Emergency Response Program has been perfected to produce the maximum effective response in the least amount of time.  The facility has coordinated response with the Emergency Operation Center to ensure that they will respond to any accidental release from the Boron Trifluoride Tube trailer.    \n\nSafety Management and Changes:  The facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered Boron Triflouride systems through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes.  To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required by RMP.  Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities."
