The previous 2008 update addresses the installation of one new, 16-Megawatt Integrated Two-Level Unit Ormat Energy Converter Unit at Heber 2 which increases the quantity of isopentane used at Heber 2.\r\n\r\nThis RMP includes the de-registering the Ormat Heber's Chlorine Processes and also serves as the 5 Year Update. This includes revised off-site consequences analyses for the Heber 1 and Heber 2 isopentane processes with the use of the EPA's RMP Comp. Both facilities are operated by Ormat-Nevada, Inc. and located in Heber, California.\r\n\r\nBoth Heber facilities have processes that contain greater amounts of isopentane than the state and federal threshold planning quantities for this flammable substance established under Section 112(r) of the federal Clean Air Act and Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code. Both Heber facilities also have processes that contain chlorine in amounts greater than the threshold quantities for this toxic substance established under these codes. The chlorine and isopentane processes at Heber 1 and Heber 2 are subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.\r\n\r\nThe updated RMP meets the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program contained in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program contained in Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations. The quantities of the two regulated substances handled at the facilities also exceed the threshold quantities in the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management regulations in 29 CFR 1910.119 and require hazard assessment under that program. \r\n\r\nBoth Heber 1 and Heber 2 use isopentane as the working fluid in the Rankine cycles for its Ormat Energy Converter Units.

      "SummaryText": "e area designed for seismic loads, pumped to the individual units, and circulated and recovered through a closed-loop system. The plants have leak detection monitors and fire protection equipment installed throughout the isopentane process area. The RMP describes the current methods of delivery, storage, transfer, use, and recovery of this\r\nflammable substance at the geothermal facilities and includes a description of the vapor recovery and evacuation units installed at Heber 1 and Heber 2. The RMP includes additional safety measures to reduce the risk of damage from release of this flammable substance.\r\n\r\nThe RMP includes the specifications for the safe handling of both regulated substances and describes the training programs for employees, operators, emergency responders, and contractors on site. It summarizes the inspection and preventive maintenance programs for the chlorine and isopentane delivery, storage, and chlorination systems and describes the incident investigations, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and pre-startup reviews for these regulated substances. The 2008 modifications to Heber 2 increase the total quantity of isopentane stored on-site and result in greater off-site consequences than the Heber 2 2006 RMP. The use of the ALOHA &reg; Model also results in greater off-site consequences for Heber 1 than described in the Heber 1 2006 RMP. Thus, this RMP update considers the 2008 Heber 2 modifications and revises the off-site consequences analyses for Heber 1 and Heber 2 isopentane process per the results of the RMP Comp.\r\n\r\nWith the implementation of the Ormat Nevada, Inc. safety and operating procedures described in the RMP, there have been no reportable accidents at Heber 1 and Heber 2 in the four years since the last RMP was prepared. No reportable accidents occurred in the previous five year RMP update either. No releases of isopentane at the facilities have resulted in death, injury, or substantial damage to onsite facilities n"
