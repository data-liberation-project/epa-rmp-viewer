The Sun Chemical Corporation Divisional headquarters is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.  This Sun Chemical Corporation facility was formerly owned and operated by Bayer Corporation, who established the Bushy Park site in 1970.  This facility was acquired by Sun Chemical Corporation in February 2003.  Before this filing date, Sun Chemical Corporation holdings at the Bushy Park Industrial Complex were included in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of Bayer Corporation, who filed their RMP by the statutory deadline.  This Sun Chemical Corporation facility is located within the Bushy Park Industrial Complex's 1650-acre site, which is owned (the land) by Cooper River Partners (CRP), LTD.  Various tenants and their asses are located on-site.  The site is on the Cooper River, just a few miles east of Goose Creek, South Carolina. \n\n\n\nII. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSun Chemical is committed to health, safety, and the environment.  Sun Chemical considers its responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, customers, and the area communities of primary importance in the conduct of its business.  It is Sun Chemical's policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to establish and implement responsible practices where laws and regulations do not exist.  Further, Sun Chemical will work with government and industry groups to foster the development of appropriate health, safety, and environmental programs, laws, and regulations.

      "SummaryText": "y with our suppliers, other companies, local officials, and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks.  \n\n\n\nIn keeping with our commitment, Sun Chemical has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\n\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the facility employees and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  Sun Chemical at the Bushy Park site is in full compliance with PSM requirements.  \n\n\n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSun Chemical uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in process areas.  Previously, these areas were included in the Bayer RMP for anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered via an overhead pipeline system from the CRP plant-wide distribution system.  Sun Chemical also uses chiller systems to provide anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in Building sC8-2 and C9-2.  This system contains anhydrous ammonia below the regulated quantity.  It has a backup supply connection to the CRP's operated site-wide anhydrous ammonia system in the event of a refrigeration unit failure.  Anhydrous ammonia when released to the atmosphere is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor.  Exposure to anhydrous ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat.  Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\n\n\nSun Chemical will also continue to use methyl chloride to make an intermediate product in the manufacture of paint pigments i"

It is extremely flammable in the liquid and vapor state with an OSHA PEL of 100 PPM.  Inhalation is the primary potential route of exposure that causes depression of the central nervous system possibly leading to headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, diarrhea, and blurred vision.  Severe or prolonged exposure can cause serious consequences and can be life threatening.\n\n\n\nSun Chemical also uses 20% Oleum in three separate processes.  Oleum is used in one process in Building C8-2 to produce a pigment product #R6422.  The Oleum is mixed with 96% sulfuric acid to raise the strength of the acid to 98%.  Pigment powder is then dissolved into this mixture.  Oleum is also used in two separate processes in Building C9-1.  Building C9-1 is owned by Kemira Corporation.  Kemira uses the oleum to produce two pigment crude acid pasting products.  In both products the oleum is mixed with 95% sulfuric acid to raise the concentration of the acid mixture to 97.5%.  The pigment crude powder is dissolved into this mixture.  The Oleum is pumped from the top of the tank directly from the bulk storage tank to the reaction vessels.  Flow rates, pounds charged, reactor levels, and temperatures are all monitored during the process.  Offloading is also continuously monitored.  The bulk storage tank pressure, temperature, and level are monitored.  The most likely point of failure would be a flange leak at the top of the tank, and maintenance does regular inspections on the header piping.\n\n\n\nIV.

Each has a storage container or containers and a transfer system, which includes transfer pump(s) and piping to deliver the material to an end use function.  The more likely scenario for each could involve a breach in the integrity of the piping system or operator error.  A flange leak or rupture could constitute a likely potential for a release of the regulated substance.  The ammonia piping system is constructed with welded pipe where a leak could not occur.  Flanged connections are used for pumps, vessel attachment and critical control valves so they can be taken out easily when repair or replacement is necessary.  \n\n\n\nThe methyl chloride and oleum piping system is similar.  The opportunity for leaks and/or ruptures is also reduced. The methyl chloride and oleum systems were part of the acquisition.  No accidents occurred before Sun Chemical to use as a history for handling.  Similar systems in operation were included in the review.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the worst-case scenario.

A valve opening that was expected to be free of gaseous ammonia instead would still be pressurized.  Gaseous ammonia would be released at 596 pound"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\n\n\n\nSun Chemical has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safe handling of the RMP regulated chemicals to prevent releases of these substances.  Our facility is prepared to handle emergencies such as hurricanes and tornadoes as well as chemical releases.  In the unlikely event a release occurs, we work to contain the release quickly and to minimize its impact on plant personnel and neighbors.  If a release occurs, equipment that supplies the regulated substance would be shut down quickly by remote control.\n\n\n\nSun Chemical is a partner and participates in the Bushy Park Industrial Complex's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) that CRP manages.  If a release occurs, the EOC is activated and the follow actions are implemented:\n\n\n\n> The plant alarm would be sounded and the emergency communicated to plant personnel over the site wide emergency alert system.\n\n> Trained on-site emergency response teams would be activated and take prompt action to control and stop the release. \n\n> Emergency response personnel would evaluate the extent and impact of the release\n\n> If the release would have potential off-site impact, or outside assistance needed, local and county emergency response personnel would be notified and activated.\n\n> Neighbors in the immediate area that might be affected would be notified and advised to take appropriate action.\n\n> If necessary, site specialists would be activated to perform computer modeling to estimate the area affected by the release. \n\n> If needed, the site has immediate access to"
