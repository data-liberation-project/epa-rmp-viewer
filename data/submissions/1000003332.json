      "SummaryText": "1. Introduction\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan for Forest City Distribution Center - 3M Company. We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community. As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history. 3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975. Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 92 percent, and releases to water 84 percent.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees. If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the local Fire Department and other emergency responders arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response.\n\n3. The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis location is a distribution center and warehouse for finished goods, primarily in small containers intended for consumer use. Containers are not opened on-site as part of any process.  We have one substance at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program. 3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and we contribute to safety by providing high quality shipping and handling processes, equipment and maintenance.\n\nThe following regulated substances are used at Forest City Distribution Center - 3M Company:\n- Isobutane is a flammable gase that is used as a propellant in aerosol cans. \n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "t Accidental Releases\n\nAt Forest City Distribution Center - 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program. Programs are in place to address accidental release prevention measures consistent with appropriate federal, state, and local requirements. Beyond government requirements, we have 3M internal standards for continuously improving safety at our facility.\n\nReflecting the low risk and the five year history showing no accidental releases at this facility, EPA criteria for Program 1 designation are met and specific prevention program elements are not addressed in this plan.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nAt Forest City Distribution Center - 3M Company, no level of accident is acceptable. We work continually to reduce the number and severity of accidents at our operations. In the five years preceding submittal of this plan, there were no accidental releases with on-site or off-site consequences meeting EPA criteria for inclusion in this plan.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\n3M's first line of defense against accidents is prevention. At Forest City Distribution Center - 3M Company we also work to ensure that we are prepared for any accident that might happen. We maintain a written emergency response plan that includes arrangements for immediate response from employees, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas. We conduct regular drills and work with the local Fire Department to ensure the proper execution of our plan. Our emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n#7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Forest City Distribution Center develops an annual Environmental, Health, and Safety Plan (EHS Plan) utilizing sources of data such as Injury and Illness Records, Investigation Reports and Incident Ra"
