Since then, there have been no significant changes to the system which would require a resubmission of the RMP prior to the 5-year requirements. \n\nMinor changes to the system have been completed in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety management Standard (29CFR 1910.119) which includes requirements for Pre-Startup Safety Reviews and Management of Change. Documentation associated with these are available onsite. \n\nThe facility has a comprehensive management system compliant with OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The program includes a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and a prevention program that includes safety precautions, maintenance, monitoring, employee training, and emergency response. Also, procedures for informing the public and response agencies (e.g the fire department). Recently (during 2022), Ace Endico updated its 5-year Process Hazard Analysis. It also has completed numerous PSM compliance audits using 3rd party auditors. \n\nThe facility utilizes a 3rd party contractor to handle routine and systemic maintenance on the ammonia system which includes a service agreement and documentation of mechanical integrity testing which is available onsite. \n\nFacility Information/Address\n\nAce Endico Corporation\n80 International Drive\nBrewster, NY 10509\n\nGeneral Applicability\nIn accordance with the EPA regulation Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act the threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 poun"

The current estimated total quantity is approximately 13,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This is a covered process for the purposes of EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.\n\nAfter review of EPA\u0092s Program Level 1, 2, and 3 the Ace Endico Warehouse Ammonia Refrigeration system will apply to EPA\u0092s Program Level 3. This is mainly because the system is subject to the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM)."
