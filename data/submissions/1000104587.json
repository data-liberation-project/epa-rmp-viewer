The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. \nBased on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n\nNote: All references above may be found within the onsite facility RMP."

International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details.\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are single-stage vapor compression cycles. In general, the process chemistry for the refrigeration system is provided in Chapter 8 of the RMP Binder. Ammonia charge of the main system and vacuum cooling system is 16,500 lb. and 1,200 lb., respectively.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3.5.3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nGreenGate Fresh facility maintains a release prevention program to prevent or mitigate releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.

Portable equipment includes one high side refrigeration trailer and two half-car vacuum tubes. Facility also leases a vacuum cooling system, which operates as a standalone system and consist of a high-side trailer and half-car vacuum tube. High side trailers have evaporative condenser, screw compressor(s) and high-pressure receiver. Portable equipment stays onsite seasonally between April through October. The main high-pressure receiver, low pressure receiver, plate frame heat exchanger with surge drums, and evaporators stay on site all the time. All refrigeration equipment, except room evaporators, are located outdoors. At the end of the operating season, all ammonia charge is pumped down to high pressure receiver and low-pressure receiver and stays on site.\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Cold room evaporators are controlled by the Refrigeration Control Panel located in electrical room. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and on the diffusion tank vent line for alarming and notifying fire alarm company which notifies the facility personnel if the ammonia vapor detected. Ammonia detection controller is located in fire alarm panel room. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nGreenGate Fresh facility conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response.\nOn-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n3.5.2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nGreenGate Fresh facility acts as a stationary source for the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia system is used for cold storage and produce pre-cooling, water chilling and vacuum cooling operations. The facility operates seasonally April through October. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan.\nThe main ammonia refrigeration system was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards in 2013 as part of the newly constructed GreenGate Fresh facility.
