The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Bulk Plant in Martinsburg are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Martinsburg Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry bulk fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as crop nutrients.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored at any one time would be 250,876 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.  The facility has two 12,000 gallon storage tanks which hold approximately 56,078 pounds each; there are thirty-two 1,000 gallon nurse tanks which hold approximately 138,720 pounds when all are full.  \n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to meet the newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    On June 19, 2003 a release of approximately 50 pounds of anhydrous ammonia due to an equipment failure, resulted in an injury to one facility employee.  The release did not cause any deaths or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, did it result in offsite deaths, injuri"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n    6/5/06"
