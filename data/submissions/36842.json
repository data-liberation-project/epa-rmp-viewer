Chlorine is an effective destroyer of pathogens in water.  Our employees and \ntheir families live here and we are all dedicated to the safe operation of our facility.\n\nPolicy:  Safety of employees and the public are of primary concern.  As a part of the \npublic service sector, we are committed to protecting the public and the environment.  Our \nprograms include an aggressive preventative maintenance program, extensive training and \ncoordination with local emergency response personnel to efficiently react to an \nemergency.\n\nDescription of the Facility:  We treat the wastewater for our area.  Part of the process \nrequires insuring that disease-causing pathogens do not cause outbreaks of illnesses in the \npublic.  Chlorine is used to kill bacteria and other pathogens in our process.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis of a Release:  In accordance with the EPA rules, an \nanalysis of the impact distance in the case of a release of all chlorine connected to this \nsystem was performed.  This analysis was made using the EPA methods and guidance \navailable April 14, 1999.  Stored chlorine not connected to the system and determined to \nnot be at reasonable risk was not included.  This model includes a release of all chlorine \nconnected, failure of all safety systems and unfavorable weather conditions.  The model \npredicts the area, which could be affected by as little as 1/10 of the concentration of gas, \nwhich is considered immediately dangerous to life and health.  A circle was generated \nwhich ignores wind direction.  This circle has a radius of 1.3 miles.\n\nAn additional release scenario was modeled.  In this case the accident used was believed \nto be more likely and more realistic weather conditions were used.  We assumed that a \nvalve on one of the chlorine tanks malfunctioned and the full tank emptied in 1 hour.  \nThis gave a potential impact radius of"

      "SummaryText": " 0.1 mile.\n\nOur system includes automatic alarms and we have procedures in place to respond to \nemergency situations.\n\nWe have a very special automatic system called a scrubber.  In the event of a chlorine leak, \nthis system is designed to collect all of the chlorine from a full cylinder and neutralize it so \nthat our employees and the public are protected.\n\nThere are strict licensing requirements to be a plant operator.  In addition to our on-site \ntraining and safety procedures, the EPA and OSHA rules regulate our activities.\n\nAs part of the requirements of this EPA program, we carefully reviewed our accident \nhistory for the last 5 years and we found that we have operated without a reportable \nchlorine related incident.  We are dedicated to safety and our record proves it.\n\nIn case of an emergency, our personnel will work with local fire department responders \nand the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  We have training every year for our \npeople and we coordinate with the fire department on a regular basis.  Although we take \nextensive precautions to prevent a chlorine release, we firmly believe in having a plan in \ncase of an emergency.  This is the same philosophy, which leads to fire drills and first aid \ntraining.\n\nWe are constantly looking for methods to improve.  As part of this PSM/RMP program \nwe performed an extensive self-evaluation with the assistance of a professional consultant.  \n\nWe are here to protect and serve our community through providing safe drinking water.  \nAnyone is welcome to call the plant with questions related to our operations."
