The ENF facility in Kyle, Texas stores approximately 120,000 of aqueous ammonia onsite. \n\nOther than ammonia (anhydrous and aqueous), the Facility uses no other chemicals that USEPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, i.e., regulated under USEPA's RMP rule. The Facility accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help the Facility effectively manage the hazards that are posed to the employees, the public, and the environment from the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe Facility takes a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. These management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-startup review\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractor management\nThese individual prevention program elements work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. The Company and the employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way business is conducted including accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThis Facility has had no accidental releases of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia in the past five years resulting in either injuries, death or evacuation of businesses or homes.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Facility is working to develop an Emergency Response Program, per the requirements of 40 CFR 68 Subpart E. The Emergency Response Program will be implemented prior to operation of the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe following is a list of improvements that are planned"

We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of the employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n* A description of the Facility\n* A description of the Facility use of substance(s) regulated by USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule\n* An overview of the Facility' accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by USEPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of the emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the Facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe ENF Technology Company, LTD (ENF) facility in Kyle, Texas manufactures ammonium hydroxide for the semiconductor industry. Raw materials for the ammonium hydroxide manufacturing process include ammonia gas. The Kyle, Texas facility stores anhydrous ammonia - liquified by pressurization - in two horizontal storage tanks, with a capacity of 50-cubic meters and 100 cubic meters, respectively.  The facility also stores aqueous ammonia (greater than 20% by weight) in two 100-cubic meter storage tanks. The ENF facility is subject to the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) and the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) due to the presence of anhydrous ammonia above PSM and RMP process safety thresholds. The PSM and RMP threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds. The ENF facility in Kyle, Texas stores approximately 230,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia onsite.  The ENF facility also stores aqueous ammonia"
