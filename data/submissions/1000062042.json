      "SummaryText": "Management at The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is committed to protecting the environment, health, and safety of our associates, our customers, and the communities where we operate.  The Houston Chemical Plant's accidental release prevention programs prevent accidents at each stage of operations from planning to operation.  New or expanded facilities are built to current engineering standards and hazard reviews are conducted on all chemical processes.  Process workers are trained and certified in detailed operating procedures.  Equipment is regularly inspected to applicable standards and inspection is an integral part of the preventative maintenance system.  \r\nCoordinated emergency response actions between the Houston Chemical Plant and local emergency officials are planned and practiced.  By working together, the emergency response teams are prepared to take the necessary measures to protect the public if an incident occurs.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\r\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant was built in 1943 by the U.S. government to produce synthetic rubber.  After World War II, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. purchased the Houston plant from the government, and has since expanded and modernized the facility.\r\nSynthetic rubber manufactured at the facility is called Plioflex rubber.  To produce it, two petrochemicals, butadiene and styrene are reacted with several chemical agents in a soap and water solution.  The reaction of butadiene and styrene to produce rubber gives off heat, and the temperature of reaction is controlled by the coolant anhydrous ammonia.  \r\nChlorine is used for waste water and cooling tower water treatment.  On site use of 1,3-butadiene, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine are stored in quantities that are regulated.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nProcess Safety Management at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Houston plant complies with all requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation. As detailed in site procedure HOU-SOP-0044"

This ERP includes procedures on responding to hazardous material releases, both large and small, and coordination with on- and off-site responders.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nAlarm Systems\r\nHouston plant has an internal plant wide alarm system for fires and emergencies. \r\n\r\nEmergency Responders\r\nTo protect onsite workers and property, Houston Plant has fully trained volunteer responders covering all four rotating shifts to ensure 24-hour coverage. Each shift has a Fire & Safety Specialist (Incident Commander), Fire Brigade members, and Emergency Medical Service/Rescue members. ERT members receive training in all recognized categories of response (Fire, Haz-Mat, Emergency Medical Treatment, Rescue and Environmental Protection). \r\n\r\nCommunications Link to Offsite Responders\r\nThe Houston plant Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is the central communication point for internal and external responders. The EOC is staffed by Management, Environmental, and Health & Safety personnel, as well as individuals who are on call, per the facility Incident Command System. The City of Houston emergency assistance is obtained by calling 911 and industry assistance is available through the mutual aid groups listed below. The plant Safety Supervisor participates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee\r\n(LEPC). In 1998, the Houston plant initially shared release scenario information with the LEPC.\r\n\r\nMobile Fire Protection Equipment\r\n\u00bd-Ton Fire Truck with equipment trailer\r\nA plant fire water system with ground-level and elevated"

Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and management of that aspect of process safety. Some of the details of this management system include:\r\n\r\n1) Employee Participation is outlined in site procedure HOU-WI-0953 Associate Participation Work Instruction and includes the plant individuals who help to drive safety by focusing individual work groups on safety activities and issues in their area.\r\n\r\n2) Process Safety Information management is outlined in site procedure HOU-SOP-0044 Process Safety Management Program which assigns a responsible position to each type of information item of process safety compliance documentation.\r\n\r\n3) Site procedure HOU-SOP-0035 Process Hazard Analysis provides site-specific details on the conduct and disposition of all unit PHAs and references to corporate PHA procedures, all of which provide oversight and management of the performance of PHAs and include relevant timelines for report development and review, recommendation development and tracking and final report issuance. The corporate procedures for conduct of PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk include consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public.\r\n\r\n4) All operating procedures are developed, reviewed and kept current by personnel experienced in the operation of that portion of the unit or in that job or task.\r\n\r\n5) Training for process operators is managed by the plant Training Department and includes rigorous initial hire or job transfer training with classroom and on-the-job elements and ongoing refresher training for experienced personnel on a frequency determined by individual need or on a maximum three-year cycle.\r\n\r\n6) The site Mechanical Integrit"

A company-wide software system aids in managing such changes and provides a means of controlling the change process through required safety and health evaluation, appropriate approval, and pre-startup safety review steps.\r\n\r\n8) Site procedure HOU-SOP-0038 Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) details the conduct of a pre-startup safety review for changes requiring this type of follow-up to ensure system integrity before introduction of hazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\n9) Audits for compliance with both the PSM and RMP regulatory requirements are conducted at least every three years according to the corporate auditing protocol. Some audits or evaluations of individual process safety elements may be conducted in the intervening years according to a specific need for that area.\r\n\r\n10) Incidents that occur in a covered process are investigated through application of site procedure HOU-SOP-0043 Incident Investigation System which provides guidance on use of the appropriate investigation method as well as development of investigation reports and corrective actions or recommendations to prevent recurrence.

There was 1 fatality and 6 injuries associated as a result of this release on June 11, 2008.  There was extensive equipment damage as a result of this incident. \r\n\r\nOff-Site Accidents\r\nThere were no off-site accidents in the last five years involving chemicals that are on the 40 CFR PART 68.130 List of Substances.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nAs part of the Houston plant commitment to continuously improving the safety of our processes, some of the initiatives and measures that have been taken or are on-going include:\r\n1. Completed a risk-based Facility Siting study based on OSHA and API RP guidelines to determine the risk to building occupants from external explosion, fire, or toxic release. Risk mitigation measures were then designed to address the greatest risks first and involved relocating personnel and demolition of buildings.\r\n2. To monitor the overall effectiveness of the facility's PSM programs, Process Safety Metrics are generated each month and reviewed with all units, departments, and Houston Leadership Team."
