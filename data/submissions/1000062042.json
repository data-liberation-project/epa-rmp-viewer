              "Description": "Process Safety Management at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Houston plant complies with all requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation. As detailed in site procedure HOU-SOP-0044 Process Safety Management Overview, the Houston plant manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization. Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and management of that aspect of process safety. Some of the details of this management system include:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation is outlined in site procedure HOU-WI-0953 Associate Participation Work Instruction and includes the plant individuals who help to drive safety by focusing individual work groups on safety activities and issues in their area.\n\n\n\n2) Process Safety Information management is outlined in site procedure HOU-SOP-0044 Process Safety Management Program which assigns a responsible position to each type of information item of process safety compliance documentation.\n\n\n\n3) Site procedure HOU-SOP-0035 Process Hazard Analysis provides site-specific details on the conduct and disposition of all unit PHAs and references to corporate PHA procedures, all of which provide oversight and management of the performance of PHAs and include relevant timelines for report development and review, recommendation development and tracking and final report issuance. The corporate procedures for conduct of PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk include consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public.\n\n\n\n4) All operating procedures are developed, reviewed and kept current by personnel experienced in the operation of that portion of the unit or in that job or task.\n\n\n\n5) Training for process operators is managed by the plant Training Department and includes rigorous initial hire or job transfer training with classroom and on-the-job elements and ongoing refresher training for experienced personnel on a frequency determined by individual need or on a maximum three-year cycle.\n\n\n\n6) The site Mechanical Integrity Program encompasses several functional groups of the Maintenance Department and includes written procedures for all maintenance activities as well as inspection and testing schedules, procedures and reports as required by both PSM and RMP.\n\n7) Changes to equipment or operations in a covered process follow site procedure HOU-SOP-0039 Management of Change Process. A company-wide software system aids in managing such changes and provides a means of controlling the change process through required safety and health evaluation, appropriate approval, and pre-startup safety review steps.\n\n\n\n8) Site procedure HOU-SOP-0038 Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) details the conduct of a pre-startup safety review for changes requiring this type of follow-up to ensure system integrity before introduction of hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\n9) Audits for compliance with both the PSM and RMP regulatory requirements are conducted at least every three years according to the corporate auditing protocol. Some audits or evaluations of individual process safety elements may be conducted in the intervening years according to a specific need for that area.\n\n\n\n10) Incidents that occur in a covered process are investigated through application of site procedure HOU-SOP-0043 Incident Investigation System which provides guidance on use of the appropriate investigation method as well as development of investigation reports and corrective actions or recommendations to prevent recurrence. A company-wide software system aids in tracking both the investigations and the resulting recommendations and their resolution.\n\n\n\n11) The site safe work practices are managed through several procedures including HOU-SOP-1311 Safe Work Permit, HOU-SOP-1323 Hot Work Permit, HOU-SOP-0040 Hazardous Work Permit, HOU-WI-0977 Line Preparation and Line Breaking, HOU-SOP-0027 Lockout Tagout Procedure, and HOU-SOP-0026 Confined Space Entry.\n\n\n\n12) Management of contract employees follows site procedure HOU-SOP-0033 Contractor Safety Program which includes selection of contractors based on their safety performance, training of contract workers on the hazards where they will be working in the plant and periodic evaluation of the performance of both the individual contract employees and the contract company in general at the Houston plant.\n\n\n\n13) The Houston plant has developed an Emergency Response Site Safety & Health Plan to guide responses to various types of emergencies and events. This ERP includes procedures on responding to hazardous material releases, both large and small, and coordination with on- and off-site responders.\n\n",

              "Description": "Process Safety Management at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Houston plant complies with all requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation. As detailed in site procedure HOU-SOP-0044 Process Safety Management Overview, the Houston plant manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization. Each element of the PSM and RMP standards is assigned to a responsible organizational position to maintain the systems that ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and management of that aspect of process safety. Some of the details of this management system include:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation is outlined in site procedure HOU-WI-0953 Associate Participation Work Instruction and includes the plant individuals who help to drive safety by focusing individual work groups on safety activities and issues in their area.\n\n\n\n2) Process Safety Information management is outlined in site procedure HOU-SOP-0044 Process Safety Management Program which assigns a responsible position to each type of information item of process safety compliance documentation.\n\n\n\n3) Site procedure HOU-SOP-0035 Process Hazard Analysis provides site-specific details on the conduct and disposition of all unit PHAs and references to corporate PHA procedures, all of which provide oversight and management of the performance of PHAs and include relevant timelines for report development and review, recommendation development and tracking and final report issuance. The corporate procedures for conduct of PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk include consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public.\n\n\n\n4) All operating procedures are developed, reviewed and kept current by personnel experienced in the operation of that portion of the unit or in that job or task.\n\n\n\n5) Training for process operators is managed by the plant Training Department and includes rigorous initial hire or job transfer training with classroom and on-the-job elements and ongoing refresher training for experienced personnel on a frequency determined by individual need or on a maximum three-year cycle.\n\n\n\n6) The site Mechanical Integrity Program encompasses several functional groups of the Maintenance Department and includes written procedures for all maintenance activities as well as inspection and testing schedules, procedures and reports as required by both PSM and RMP.\n\n7) Changes to equipment or operations in a covered process follow site procedure HOU-SOP-0039 Management of Change Process. A company-wide software system aids in managing such changes and provides a means of controlling the change process through required safety and health evaluation, appropriate approval, and pre-startup safety review steps.\n\n\n\n8) Site procedure HOU-SOP-0038 Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) details the conduct of a pre-startup safety review for changes requiring this type of follow-up to ensure system integrity before introduction of hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\n9) Audits for compliance with both the PSM and RMP regulatory requirements are conducted at least every three years according to the corporate auditing protocol. Some audits or evaluations of individual process safety elements may be conducted in the intervening years according to a specific need for that area.\n\n\n\n10) Incidents that occur in a covered process are investigated through application of site procedure HOU-SOP-0043 Incident Investigation System which provides guidance on use of the appropriate investigation method as well as development of investigation reports and corrective actions or recommendations to prevent recurrence. A company-wide software system aids in tracking both the investigations and the resulting recommendations and their resolution.\n\n\n\n11) The site safe work practices are managed through several procedures including HOU-SOP-1311 Safe Work Permit, HOU-SOP-1323 Hot Work Permit, HOU-SOP-0040 Hazardous Work Permit, HOU-WI-0977 Line Preparation and Line Breaking, HOU-SOP-0027 Lockout Tagout Procedure, and HOU-SOP-0026 Confined Space Entry.\n\n\n\n12) Management of contract employees follows site procedure HOU-SOP-0033 Contractor Safety Program which includes selection of contractors based on their safety performance, training of contract workers on the hazards where they will be working in the plant and periodic evaluation of the performance of both the individual contract employees and the contract company in general at the Houston plant.\n\n\n\n13) The Houston plant has developed an Emergency Response Site Safety & Health Plan to guide responses to various types of emergencies and events. This ERP includes procedures on responding to hazardous material releases, both large and small, and coordination with on- and off-site responders.\n\n",

The Houston Chemical Plant's accidental release prevention programs prevent accidents at each stage of operations from planning to operation.  New or expanded facilities are built to current engineering standards and hazard reviews are conducted on all chemical processes.  Process workers are trained and certified in detailed operating procedures.  Equipment is regularly inspected to applicable standards and inspection is an integral part of the preventative maintenance system.  \n\nCoordinated emergency response actions between the Houston Chemical Plant and local emergency officials are planned and practiced.  By working together, the emergency response teams are prepared to take the necessary measures to protect the public if an incident occurs.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant was built in 1943 by the U.S. government to produce synthetic rubber.  After World War II, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. purchased the Houston plant from the government, and has since expanded and modernized the facility.\n\nSynthetic rubber manufactured at the facility is called \"Plioflex\" rubber.  To produce it, two petrochemicals, butadiene and styrene are reacted with several chemical agents in a soap and water solution.  The reaction of butadiene and styrene to produce rubber gives off heat, and the temperature of reaction is controlled by the coolant anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nChlorine is used for waste water and cooling tower water treatment.  On site use of 1,3-butadiene, anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine are stored in quantities that are regulated.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcess Safety Management at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.
