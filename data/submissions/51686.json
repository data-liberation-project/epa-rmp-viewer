If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Kern County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also train employees to handle small emergencies.\n\nA discription or our facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail propane outlets and end users.  The facility consists of one 30,000-gal., one 24,000gal., one 12,300gal., and one rail car connected to the process at a time with a water capacity of up to 34,500gal.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  Our worst case scenario is failure of one 34,500-gallon tank car when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA`s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history ;  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Kern County Fire Departme"
