The results showed that none of the processes has the potential for off-site impacts. Also, none of these processes has been involved in any accidental releases during the past five years that resulted in emergency situations or damage to the environment. Furthermore, DSCR is coordinating its emergency response program with local responders. These results show that all the processes belong to Program Level 1."

      "SummaryText": "nd Emergency Services Branch, under DLA Installation Management Richmond.  The ER Program follows written procedures, as outlined in the ER Plan, for emergency response notification and coordination of activities related to fire, emergency medical assistance, rescue, and hazardous materials release. There is a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between DLA Aviation and the County of Chesterfield, VA; which establishes Mutual Aid agreements for assistance (fire protection, spill response, specialized rescue and medical assistance) with the Chesterfield County Fire and Emergency Medical Services. Members of the DLA Richmond Security and Emergency Services Division coordinate regularly with the Chesterfield County Local Emergency Planning Committee\n\n6. Processes Subject to the RMP Rule\n\nThere are 2 substances stored at DSCR that are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's RMP rule. These substances are (1) Methyl ether (non-rechargeable batteries) and (2) Sulfur Dioxide (non-rechargeable batteries). Due to the fluctuating nature of operations (warehousing) at DSCR, the possibility of storing these chemicals above or below the RMP threshold cannot be ruled out. All the reported substances directly involve the warehouse storage operations at DSCR. A list of the processes subject to the RMP Rule, along with their storage locations and quantities (predictive) of each regulated substance is given below.\n\nChemical:  Methyl Ether              \nLocation: Warehouse 8 - Bay B,  Warehouse 9 - Bay B & D\nQuantity Stored (lb.):  25,600 (predictive)      \nThreshold Quantity (lb.): 10,000\n                         \nChemical: Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous)\nLocation: Warehouse 9 - Bay D             \nQuantity Stored (lb.):  321,068 (predictive)            \nThreshold Quantity (lb.): 5,000\n\nA worst case scenario analysis was conducted on all processes that are subject to the rules.

      "SummaryText": "by the Bureau of Explosives.  This process is known as the refurbishment of the ODS cylinders.\n\nFor this RMP update, the storage of materials, the reclamation and refurbishing of ODS and several other activities which occur at the installation were investigated from the standpoint of the RMP rule. For example, Building 80 houses the Equipment Maintenance Branch, consisting of Material Handling & Equipment and the Automotive and Heavy Equipment shop. While there are many activities here that involve the use of chemicals (naphtha-based degreasing solvents, new and spent engine oils, batteries, tires, and other materials generally associated with vehicle maintenance), such chemicals are not covered by the RMP rule.\n Similarly, vehicle maintenance and painting operations  at the Virginia Army National Guard Facility located on DSCR do not handle chemicals that are covered by the RMP rule.\n\n\n3. Distribution and Warehousing of Materials\n\nOnce a substance arrives at DSCR, the substance is inventoried; a stock number is assigned, and in turn distributed to the appropriate warehouse or storage location. Ozone-depleting substances are sent to Building 3, where the substances are reclaimed and the cylinders are refurbished. DSCR also receives substances which are designated for redistribution to other supply centers within the DLA. \n\n4. Data Management and Availability of Storage Records\n\nDue to the large number of items and materials that pass through DSCR, the volumes of these items and materials are logged in a computerized database named Distribution Standard System (DSS). This system allows data to be sorted by materials, stock number, storage location, hazard code, available balance, and other data fields. This database is invaluable in identifying RMP-regulated chemicals present at the Depot, their location, and the quantities in which they are being stored.\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "1. Installation Description\nThe Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is located just south of Richmond, Virginia and is an inventory control point within the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  DLA is charged with procuring and distributing supplies to the armed forces.  DSCR is DLA's aviation supply and demand chain manager and is the primary source of supply for more than 1.1 million repair parts and operating supply items supporting 1,800 major weapon systems.\n  \nDSCR consists of 611 acres of property situated between Falling Creek to the north and Kingsland Creek on its southern boundary in Chesterfield County, Virginia.  Land use principally consists of office buildings, warehouses, parking areas and open spaces.\n\n2. Types of Chemicals and Processes Present at DSCR\n\nOzone-depleting substances (ODS) form a substantial proportion of chemicals stored at DSCR. However, ODS are not on the List of Regulated Toxic Substances (40 CFR 68.130) within the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. Among the chemicals on this list, the following chemicals are stored on DSCR at levels that exceed the RMP reportable threshold; Methyl ether, sulfur dioxide, and propane. These substances are regulated by the RMP rule as either a toxic or flammable substance.  However, clause \u00a768.126 states that flammable substances that are listed as regulated in Tables 3 and 4 of \u00a768.130, are nevertheless excluded from all provisions of Part 68 when the substance is used as a fuel or held for sale as a fuel at a retail facility. Since propane is used as fuel for internal consumption at DSCR, it is excluded from this report.\n\nOther than storage of ODS, the Defense Distribution Depot performs an important function: the reclamation and refurbishing of ODS and inert gases (such as oxygen, argon, and nitrogen).  While the ODS are recovered, inert gases are bled to the atmosphere.  After the ODS have been reclaimed, the empty cylinders are cleaned, tested, and re-certified (or rejected) by persons qualified"
