To achieve these goals, Petro-Hunt strives to integrate safety features in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its facilities. Petro-Hunt policy is to implement practical controls and management systems to prevent foreseeable potential releases of hazardous substances. However, if a release does occur, the Little Knife Gas Plant has a well-defined emergency action plan and trained personnel to control and contain the release. The Little Knife Gas Plant process operations are covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA\u0092s) risk management plan (RMP) rule. The following sections describe the prevention program and engineered safeguards implemented by Petro-Hunt to help prevent releases of hazardous substances, the source and regulated substances, the results of offsite consequence analysis results for each regulated substance, a five-year accidental release history, and provide an overview of the emergency response plan implemented at the site.\n\n6.1\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBecause the Little Knife Gas Plant process is subject to Program Level 1 of the EPA's RMP rule, a formal accidental release prevention program is not required. In addition, the gas plant process is covered by the OSHA's PSM standard. The accidental release prevention program described in this section covers some of the important management systems at the Little Knife Gas Plant and additional safeguards specifically provided to reduce the likelihood of any release of regulated substances and/or mitigate the severity of consequences if such releases were to occur.\n\n6.1.1\tEmployee Involvement and Training\n\nThe Little Knife Gas Plant conducts its business using a teamwork approach.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plan has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. Depending on the severity of the incident, employees have the ability and training to respond to the insipient stages of a fire but cannot use offensive firefighting techniques. In case of LOPC, employees can only isolate the spill or leak from outside hot zone. Outside agencies will respond to more severe incidents.
