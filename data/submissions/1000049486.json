The MiVida Gas Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nThe facility and system of pipelines is jurisdictional to the Environmental Protection Agency, Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, Texas Railroad Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the United States Department of Transportation.  This facility is covered by OSHA PSM standard.  These agencies conduct periodic facility inspections and report findings to Energy Transfer management.\r\n\r\nThe facility receives gas from surrounding oil and gas fields and other sites.  Gas is received in the MiVida facility with CO2 and water, which is removed in the sweetening process.  The natural gas liquids as well as the compressed natural gas are then transported from the facility through pipelines to third party customers.  The two compounds in the facility that contain substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) in the amounts greater than threshold quantity are natural gas liquids (NGL) and propane.  These are both reported as flammable liquids.  The NGL is made up of RMP regulated substances of ethane, propane, butane/methane, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are public receptors within the distance of the endpoint of the worst case scenario. There have been no releases of regulated substances that have created emergency response activities with the surrounding public agencies.

The purpose of the RMP is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe MiVida Gas Plant is located 6 miles north Barstow, Texas in Ward County on FM 516.\r\n\r\nAs specified by the USEPA RMP Regulations, our worst case release would be the loss of all of the unstabilized condensate in our largest vessel (inlet slug catcher, V-1000) causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPA RMP equations, the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.73 mile.  An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  Potential releases have been discussed with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Ward County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public. \r\n\r\nThe MiVida Gas Plant operates under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety has helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\nInstallation of a continuous lit natural gas flare;\r\nEmergency shutdown valves for removing the product from the system during emergency situations; and \r\nAutomatic pump shutdown.\r\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped the plant to operate safely.

Daily emphasis on prevention and safety programs should ensure this record continues.\r\n\r\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) specific to the facility is in place and has been coordinated with the Barstow Volunteer Fire Department and the Ward County Sheriff .  The Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  The ERP in place deals with evacuation procedures, training, etc.  The ERP provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the MiVida Gas Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\r\nThe Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\r\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\r\nAn ongoing dialogue with the Ward County Emergency Management Director or their designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.
