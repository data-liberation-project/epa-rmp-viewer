While these items and parts have an extremely wide range of applications, our core mission is to supply products with a direct application to aviation.  These items include a mix of military-unique items supporting over 1,300 major weapons systems and other items readily available in the commercial market.  \n\nWith over 600 acres and approximately 120 warehousing, utility and administrative buildings totaling over 6.7 million square feet, however, Defense Supply Center Richmond is host for a number of other Department of Defense, federal and state organizations. The largest of these tenants are the 350-acre Defense Distribution Depot Richmond Virginia; the Defense Distribution Mapping Activity; the Virginia Army National Guard vehicle maintenance activity, and the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office. The center and its tenant activities employ nearly 3,000 civilians, service members and contractor personnel, whose mission is to provide critical material support across the Department of Defense and other federal agencies, including NASA.\n\n2. Types of Chemicals and Processes Present at DSCR\n\nAlthough ozone-depleting substances form a substantial proportion of chemicals stored at DSCR, many other chemicals are present in significant quantities.  (Note that ozone-depleting substances are typically not regulated by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.)  Among these chemicals are hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, chlorine, acetylene, hydrogen, propane, formaldehyde, hydr"

However, storage quantity of chemicals like chlorine, nitric acid, propane, formaldehyde and ethylene oxide remain below the respective RMP thrshold.\n\nOther than storage of ozone-depleting substances, the Defense Distribution Depot performs an important function the reclamation and refurbishing of ODS and inert gases (such as oxygen, argon, and nitrogen).  While the ODS are recovered, inert gases are bled to the atmosphere.  After the ODS have been reclaimed, the empty cylinders are cleaned, tested, and re-certified (or rejected) by persons qualified by the Bureau of Explosives.  This process is known as the refurbishment of the ODS cylinders.\n\nFor the RMP update, not only was the storage of materials and the refurbishment of containers investigated but, several other activities which occur at the installation were investigated from the standpoint of the RMP rule.  Building 80 houses the Equipment Maintenance Branch, consisting of Material Handling & Equipment and the Automotive and Heavy Equipment shop.  While there are many activities here that involve the use of chemicals, such chemicals are typically not covered by the RMP rule.  Examples of the chemicals handled are paints and solvents (in the automotive paint booth), degreasing solvents (mainly containing naphtha), new and spent engine oils, batteries, tires, and other materials generally associated with vehicle maintenance.  Similar operations are being conducted over at the Virginia Army National Guard Facility.  The results of the investigation determined that there are no chemicals present in Building 80, or over at the Virginia Army National Guard facility which the RMP Program would apply.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "DSCR, and because of the large volumes of these items and materials, computerized databases were essential to reviewing the installation's inventories.  The Depot has a database known as the Distribution Standard System (DSS).  This system allows data to be sorted by materials, stock number, storage location, hazard code, available balance, and other data fields.  This database was invaluable in identifying RMP-regulated chemicals present at the Depot, their location, and the quantities in which they are being stored.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program is currently being implemented at DSCR.  The Fire Prevention and Protection Division (the Fire Department) at DSCR follows written procedures for emergency response notification and coordinates activities related to fire, rescue, and hazardous material response.  A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between DSCR and the County of Chesterfield, VA has been signed.  Mutual Aid agreements for assistance (fire protections, spill response, and medical assistance) are established with the Chesterfield County Fire Department.  Members of the LEPC attend and conduct training exercises and DSCR personnel participate in the training sessions.\n\n6. Processes Subject to the RMP Rule\n\nAs of May 18th, 2009 there were 5 substances stored at DSCR that are subject to EPA's RMP rules.  These 5 substances are \u00c2\u00bf (1) Acetylene, (2) Hydrochloric Acid, (3) Hydrogen, (4) Hydrofluoric Acid and (5) Engine Starting Fluid (Ethyl Ether). At the time of verification only acetylene was stored in a quantity that exceeded the RMP threshold. The other four substances either were stored in a quantity that is below the RMP threshold (Hydrogen, Engine Starting fluid and Hydrofluoric Acid) or the concentration of the chemical (Hydrochloric Acid) stored at the time is less than the required concentration to allow these chemicals to be categorized as an RMP chemical. However, due to the nature of operations (warehousing operation)"
