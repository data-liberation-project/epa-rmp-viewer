This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable control to prevent foreseeable release ot regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\nMcEntire Produce is a fresh produce processor, repacker and wholesaler.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMcEntire Produce encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the McEntire Produce accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming te"

The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance and plant management. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nMcEntire Produce keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventory, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate an necessary process safety information\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing or chemicals. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. - temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. - automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nMcEntire Produce primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if checklist analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\nMcEntire Produce maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) initial startup of a new process.

Written procedures help ensure that work is\nperformed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help\nensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g.-\nadequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency\nbefore placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the\nuse of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. McEntire produce incorporates\nquality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is\nsuitable for its intended use and those proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nMcEntire Produce has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.\nExamples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out\nprocedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance (3) a procedure for\nsafe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and\nprocedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that\nadequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\nIn addition, McEntire Produce maintains Operating Procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, McEntire Produce has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training for their job tasks. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. - through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nContractors\nMcEntire Produce uses contractors to supplement its work force during period of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, McEntire Produce evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractorsare fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\nMcEntire Produce conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure those safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment is appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready.
