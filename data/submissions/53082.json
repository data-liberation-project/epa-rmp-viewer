The scenario indicates a 1-psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance does not impact public receptors. \n\nCompliance Audits: Compliance audits are conducted at three year intervals. The last was completed October 2011.\n\nThe plant is functionally divided into three sections: Gas Plant, Compression Storage, and Refrigeration Skid.  The main function of the facility is to extract liquid hydrocarbons and prepare produced gas for sales.  The natural gasoline liquids are stored in multiple pressure vessels, the largest being 80,000 gallons.  \n\nThis is a remote facility.\n\nAll visitors entering the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  \n\nSeismic parameters were addressed by conducting a walkthrough of the facility and reviewing the mechanical integrity records.  There were no significant indications of deterioration. \n\n\n\nThe seismic walkthrough was conducted as a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, 19 CCR 2735.  During the preliminary visits, it was believed that this facility would fall under a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 due to the process safety management regulatory oversight.  However, after consideration of the remote location and discussions with the Certified Unified Program Agency, (Dale Hineman and Dan Starky, April 19, 1999), the South Coles Levee Unit qualified as a Program Level 1.  External events analyses are not required for Program Level 1 filing.  \n\n\n\nThe seismic walkthrough consisted of a visual inspection the process area piping and vessels above grade.
