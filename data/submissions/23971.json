We are an agricultural based business that primarily buys and sells grain as well as other inputs necessary for crop production.\n\nOur NH3 plant consist of two storage tanks,  one-18,000 and one-12,000 gallon, with associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The total capacity of the plant is 132,000 pounds when filled to 85% capacity. \n\n The worst case scenario for our Anhydrous Ammonia would be failure of the 18,000-gallon tank,  resulting in a gas release over a 10 minute period.  According to our DEGADIS guide, the distance to endpoint is 1.89 miles with an approximate population of approximately 2  area residents.  Public receptors include only one residence.  The alternative release scenario would be a transfer hose rupture with a total of 11,908 pounds released to the air.  The distance to endpoint would be .83 miles.  There is no public receptor within that distance to endpoint.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes, are regulations.   The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed,and maintained in accordance with Kansas State Ag Department, which inspects our plant annually and we respond to all their request for improvement.\n\n We are pleased to report we have had no accidents in the past five years at this facility, and hope to maintain this good safety record, by constantly upgrading and reviewing our safety procedures and practices.  Our employees are trained annually in the safe use of the product, the hazards of NH3, proper plant maintenance practices as well as the recommended operatimg procedures.  The employees always wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) during nurse tank filling operations.  Clean safety water is always on hand during these operations. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving "
