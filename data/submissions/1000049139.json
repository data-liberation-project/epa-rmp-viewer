This facility has mechanisms in-place as identified in the Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification/Procedures and Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems to address releases of ammonia.  Designated facility personnel have received required OSHA training to respond to an ammonia release.  If an emergency release were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThis facility is a poultry processing facility used to slaughter, cut-up, package, refrigerate and ship fresh poultry.  The facility receives live chickens which are slaughtered, processed and refrigerated for shipping to destinations in the region.  We use ammonia as a refrigerant in five (5) separate systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including coolers, spiral freezers, evaporator units, water chillers and ice makers.  The systems are identified as systems 1 through 5 and have a maximum intended inventories of 16,439, 2,567, 9,319, 9,184 and 21,519 pounds, respectively.  Thus, the total plant capacity is 59,028 pounds of ammonia.\r\n\r\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  \r\n\r\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a pipe or vessel in ammonia refrigeration system No. 1 when it is operating with its maximum intended inventory of 16,439 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 200 ppm ammonia toxic endpoint is 1.64 miles and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scena"
