Coordination may include:\n\n1. Periodic meetings between operators, Bastrop Sheriff Department personnel, and fire department emergency responders to discuss emergency response measures.\n\n2. Periodic Inspections of the facility by sheriff department and fire department emergency responders to ensure their familiarity with routes to the facility, ingress and egress routes at the facility, and layout of the chlorine process areas.\n\n3. Periodic practice drills utilizing both Aqua and fire department personnel.\n\nEmployees responsible for working with chlorine will receive periodic training, as detailed in the Procedures Manual of the Risk Management Program.\n\nImproving Safety\nAqua Water Supply Corporation will continue to improve its Risk Management Program for the L Pump Station by responding to the recommended changes outlined in the Hazard Review, by ongoing training of personnel, and by continued coordination with emergency response officials.  As the L Pump Station grows to meet the growing demands of Aqua's service area, future plant expansions will consider further improvements in the chlorinating process to manage risks associated with this regulated substance."

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe L Pump Station is located near Smithville, Texas.  The facility is owned and operated by Aqua Water Supply Corporation.  This facility produces ground water for distribution to residential and commercial customers.  Chlorine is used at the facility to disinfect the ground water prior to storage and distribution.  Currently, a maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine is maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR 68, are stored or utilized at the facility.  Chlorine is stored under pressure in one-ton containers.\n\nSafety Policies\nAqua Water Supply Corporation is fully committed to safety at the L Pump Station.  As a result of the risk management rules, Aqua is working to coordinate with the Bastrop Sheriff's Department 911 to establish a viable emergency response procedure.  However, Smithville Fire Department is capable of responding to accidental releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia, should a release occur.  Aqua Water Supply Corporation is committed to a process of continual improvement in its risk management program at the L Pump Station.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe Commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine is demonstrated by the excellent track record at the L Pump Station with respect to chlorine handling.  The L Pump Station has not experienced an accident related to chlorine within the past five years.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nAs required by the risk management regulations, the offsite consequence analysis required development of worst-case release and alternative-release scenarios for chlorine.  Realistic potential alternatives were modeled, with consideration toward actual condition at the site.  The resulting radii of impact are therefore useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emerency situations.\n\nPrevention Program Description\nThe prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidential releases of regulat"

This component will be used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program will also become a useful tool in ongoing training of plant personnel.\n\nThe Program 3 Prevention Program includes twelve primary components:\n1. Process Safety Information: Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment.  Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\n\n2. Process Hazard Analysis: Regulated processes at the facility have been reviewed to identify potential hazards.  The results have been documented in a hazard review report.  Problems identified by the hazard analysis are being resolved in a timely manner.\n\n3. Operating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safety conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures will also be updated should a major change in the handling or storage of regulated substances occur.\n\n4.Training: Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in the processes.  Periodic refresher training is required.\n\n5. Mechanical Integrity: Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the process equipment is maintained.  Ongoing training of personnel responsible for maintenance is also required.  Inspection and testing of regulated process equipment is a requirement as well.\n\n6. Management of Change: Procedures have been implemented to manage changes to the chlorine process in order to ensure that employees are aware of the changes and have been trained in the modified system.\n\n7.Pre-Startup Review: Procedures have been implemented to perform an audit of modified chlorine processes to ensure that appropriate modifications to the Risk Management Program have"

The results of the audit will be documented, and deficiencies corrected.\n\n9. Incident Investigation: Should an incident involving a release, or near release, of a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety of the process.\n\n10.Employee Participation: The prevention program has been designed to incorporate the knowledge and experience of the employees by providing for their participation in Risk Management Program reviews, investigations of incidents, audits of the program, training, and other important aspects of the Risk Management Program.\n\n11.Hot Work Permit: The Maintenance procedures include provisions for hot-work permits to reduce hazards that could be caused by performing work near chlorine processes.\n\n12.Contractors: Procedures have been implemented that clearly identify the risk management responsibilities of contractors who perform chlorine-related work on the facility site.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAqua Water Supply Corporation has determined that the L Pump Station will assume a non-responder status with respect to accidental releases of chlorine.  The Bastrop Sheriff's Department 911 will instead be the appropriate local emergency response agency and Smithville Fire Department has the necessary training to respond to chlorine leaks.  Aqua Water Supply Corporation has coordinated with the Smithville Fire Department to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan regarding response to a potential release.\n\nEven though the L Pump Station will be a non-responding facility, its employees still have a significant role in the event of a release of chlorine.
