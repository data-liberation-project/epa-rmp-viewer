This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Russellville Pollution Control Works implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of the Russellville Pollution Control Works and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Russellville Pollution Control Works is located within the city limits of Russellville, Arkansas.  The facility has the capacility to treat up to 20 million gallons of wastewater per day.  The Russellville Pollution Control Works handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for the disinfection of water treated prior to release to the receiving stream.\n\n \n\n \n\n 3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires The Russellville Pollution Control Works to perform a Hazard Assessment of the chlorine stored and used in the chlorination process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n \n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe results of this Hazard Assessment have been communicated to the appropriate local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\n4.0"

Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Russellville Pollution Control Works, including the chlorine in the covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe Russellville Pollution Control Works performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the Russellville Pollution Control Works operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Russellville Pollution Control Works develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n4.4    Training\n\n\n\nThe Russellville Pollution Control Works trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks.
