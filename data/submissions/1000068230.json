The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\n\r\nDurango Midstream, LLC has a commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained facility personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Kelton Gas Plant is located near Wheeler, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\r\n\r\n1.\tStabilized Condensate\r\n2.\tRegulated Flammable Products:\r\na.\tMethane\r\nb.\tEthane\r\nc.\tPropane\r\nd.\tButane\r\ne.\tIsobutane\r\nf.\tPentane\r\ng.\tIsopentane\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nA.
