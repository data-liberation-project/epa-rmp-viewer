      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary for Crimson Exploration Operating, Inc  Swilley Facility\n\n\n1.\tCrimson is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tOur facility's primary activities encompass Oil and Natural Gas production.  We have eight regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Isobutane, Butane, Neopentane, Isopentane, and Pentane.  These substances compose the natural gas liquids that will be separated from the produced gas before the gas is pipelined from the lease.\n \n\n3.\tThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 1 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a Storage Tank.  In this scenario 159,420 lbs. of a Flammable Mixture containing the substances identified above, is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.40 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. \n\nThere is no alternative release scenario. \n\n\n4.\tOur facility has taken all the necessary steps required of a Program Level 1 facility to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    This includes the preparation of an Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated with the appropriate local responders.\n\n\n5.\tThis facility has no history of any prior accidental releases.\n\n\n6.\tKerr-McGee carries a written emergency response plan to deal with"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our plans are periodically reviewed and promptly updated as required to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.  Any changes regarding emergency contact information will be provided to the EPA within one month of the change. \n\nThe Liberty County Office of Emergency Management is where our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n7.\tKerr-McGee will continuously monitor the operations and improve and/or update items related to making this facility a safer operation"
