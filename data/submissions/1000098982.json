To save lives.\n\n?    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n?    To protect the environment.\n\n?    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmericold maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes,\n\nammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\n\n\nThis Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Americold, Empire facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in pressures are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (appro"

Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    ANSI/IIAR Standard 1-2017 American National Standard for Definitions and Terminology Used in IIAR Standards\n\n?

      "SummaryText": "ng the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures. In addition, it was recommended\n\nthat the facility contacts the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDuring the Review of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the Americold, Americold, Empire facility located at 3485 Empire Blvd. Atlanta, GA 30354. These action items were entered into APSM which generates a tracking document that provides reminder communications via e-mails if the recommendation(s) are open pass its due date.\n\n\n\nOn an annual basis the technicians at the site complete annual visual inspections of each major piece of equipment. All gaps are documented in APSM which generates a tracking document that provides reminder communications via e-mails if the recommendation(s) are open pass its due date.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the annual visual inspections the site utilizes a third party to perform the 5-year comprehensive Mechanical Integrity Inspection and a Non Destructive test to determine the condition of the insulation and the quantity of wall loss for selected pipe locations and vessels. The recommendations from this major Inspection are loaded to APSM which generates a tracking document that provides reminder communications via e-mails if the recommendation(s) are open pass its due date.\n\n"
