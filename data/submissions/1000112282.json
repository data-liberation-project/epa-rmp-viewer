Sinclair Refining Company purchased the refinery in 1934 and operated it until 1972, including a period of operations as a subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield Company.  In 1972, PASCO purchased the refinery, then in 1976 it was acquired by Sinclair Oil Corporation and operated as Sinclair Wyoming Refining Company.  In March 2022, Holly Frontier Corporation acquired all of Sinclair Oil\u0092s assets.  The corporation became HF Sinclair Corporation, and the refinery in Sinclair, Wyoming was renamed Parco.  \n\nDescription of Refinery Processes:\nParco includes modern process units typically used for production of petroleum fuels, atmospheric and vacuum distillation, hydrotreating, reforming, fluidized catalytic cracking, delayed coking, alkylation and associated supporting operations such as crude oil unloading, sulfur recovery, blending and crude oil/product storage and transport.  The NAICS code for Parco is 32411. \n\nParco manufactures the following:\n\nAsphalt\nJet Fuel\nPropane\nDiesel\nFuel Oil\nSulfur\nGasoline\nPetroleum Coke\nLiquefied Petroleum Gases\nRenewable Diesel\n\nRMP Program - Definition of Process and Regulated Substance: \nThe RMP rule defines a process as \u0093Any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.

Projects are underway to replace this with urea or aqueous ammonia. \n\nBecause the quantities of these toxic substances are less than their respective RMP threshold values, none of the toxic substances are RMP reportable.  Nevertheless, our prevention and safety programs include these toxic substances.   \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Process-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nParco\u0092s accidental release prevention program includes the provisions of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program and OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program summarized below.

This is accomplished by actively assuring wide employee participation in a thorough PSM program and appropriate safety training.  \n\nThe PSM program is managed by at the site with a local team, with accountability to the Refinery Manager, with technical input from corporate resources.   \n\nOur management recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both the refinery and the local community.  Policies ensure that our efforts of prevention through planning, training, process controls, timely maintenance and communication with our neighbors will help prevent unforeseeable releases of regulated substances.  Should a release nevertheless occur, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond, mitigate and contain the release. \n\nPSM & RMP Program:\nFor the RMP-covered processes, we use OSHA's PSM standard and EPA\u0092s RMP rule as the basis for our accident prevention program. \n\nEmployee Participation:\nWe encourage employees to participate in every aspect of process safety management and accid"

We use teams of knowledgeable, trained personnel from safety, maintenance, operations, environmental, engineering and plant management.  The team evaluates potential process hazards and identifies accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes recommendations about systems, procedures or practices to put in place to ensure that risks are mitigated to tolerable levels. \n\nThe PHA team findings are shared with management for review and resolution.  Implementation of systems, procedures and practices is based on a determination of risk associated with the findings.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  These procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the MOC process.  \n\nTraining:\nWe compliment the written operating procedures with a comprehensive training program.  New employees receive initial training in refinery operations and safety practices.
