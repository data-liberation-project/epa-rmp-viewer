This Risk Management Plan summarizes\nthe management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together  to\nminimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n     Introduction;\n    Atofina Chemical's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n     Hazard Assessment;\n     Prevention Program;\n     Five-Year Accident History;\n     Emergency Response Plan;\n     Planned changes to improve safety; and,\n     Clean Air Act Amendments Title V Permit Status.\n\nAtofina Chemical's Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at Atofina Chemical for many years; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Atofina Chemical is committed to conducting itsoperations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO. Senior management routinely dedicates time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the management team and the Safety Champions Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Atofina Chemical's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nAtofina Chemical's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials\ndesigned to fulfill Atofina Chemical's commitment to health, environment, and safety.

We are dedicated to\ncontinuous reduction of waste, and have a comprehensive program called AWARE (Atochem Waste And Release Elimination) designed to promote recycling and waste minimization.  We have substantially reduced waste and emissions in recent years.  Our Plant goals also support reductions of waste and emissions.\n\nAtofina Chemical also participates in the Chemical Manufacturers Association Responsible Care \ninitiative.

The facility manufactures industrial chemicals, primarily amines and acids.  Our products are used to produce a wide variety of products including photographic products, pharmaceuticals, electronics, cosmetics, paints, cleaners, tires, water treatment products, and agricultural chemicals.  \n\nCertain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the\nEPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.

Ethylamine is produced as a product and is also used as a process feedstock.  Propane is used as a back-up fuel for the plant steam boilers.\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe EPA regulations specify that facilities include in their RMP an analysis of a worst case accident (one where all safety systems fail at the same time) for listed toxic chemicals and for listed flammables.  The regulations also specify that alternative accidents (ones that are more realistic) be included.\n\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe toxic worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a chlorine railroad tank car containing 180,000 pounds.  This quantity was assumed to be released over 10 minutes in the worst-case scenario.  Hazard assessment modeling shows that, under worst-case weather conditions, the worst-case toxic release could produce a chlorine plume that could travel more than 25 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nThe flammable worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a propane tank\ncontaining 130,000 pounds.  This quantity was assumed to be released instantly in the worst case\nscenario resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.   Hazard assessment modeling shows that the worst-case flammable release could produce a vapor cloud explosion that could impact an area at distances up to 0.41 miles, at a force up to 1.0 pound per square inch.\n\nIt shou"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our\noperations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reducing and\nmitigating accidents.\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nMeasures that would prevent the worst-case scenarios, a chlorine railroad tank car failure and a\npropane storage tank failure, include:\n\n     These tanks are pressure vessels which are designed and constructed in accordance with\n     industry pressure vessel standards using industry-standard materials of construction;\n\n     As part of the Mechanical Integrity program, and per DOT requirements (chlorine railroad\n     tank cars) pressure vessels are periodically inspected and tested;\n\n     Over-pressure is prevented by a system of pressure relief valves;\n\n     Tanks are located in areas with no overhead construction or equipment that could fall and\n     impact a tank;\n\n     Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel,\n     thereby minimizing the risk to the tanks of vehicular damage or sabotage;\n\n      Fire hazards are controlled through procedures, training, and the hot work permit system\n     (propane); and\n\n     Tanks are frequently visually inspected to ensure they are in good condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative scenarios selected for anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, dimethylamine, furan, methyl mercaptan, and propylene oxide were a railroad tank car or tank truck unloading line (or flexible hose) connection leaks.  Prevention measures for these scenarios include:\n\n     Rail car and tan"

These EPA criteria are focused on serious accidents with either on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. Atofina Chemical realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and in internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the Atofina Chemi"
