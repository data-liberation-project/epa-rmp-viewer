This facility has been designed in a manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases. Southcross is committed to operating the facility in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public and the environment. Southcross strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors and others who may be affected by the activities at the facility. The ultimate goal of this plan is to limit the adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. Southcross has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program that helps manage the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA's) rule 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. One of the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at the Bonnie View Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP executive summary requirement of the Risk Management Program rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the Bonnie View Plant subject to Program 1 requirements. \r\n\r\na. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSouthcross is committed to minimizing potential risks to the general public, to the facility employees and to the environment. A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The Bonnie View Plant utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well trained operations personnel to contain, mitigate, monitor and s"

The facility plans to participate in training with the local emergency response teams for firefighting and emergency rescue to prepare all parties for an accidental release.\r\n\r\nSouthcross Safety Specialist, Mr. Lance Jones, is responsible for all aspects of the Risk Management Program elements including development, implementation and integration, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) elements, for the facility. The Plant Superintendent, Mr. Wayland Barmore, is the primary contact for all emergency situations pertaining to accidental releases at the Bonnie View Plant. The Plant Superintendent is also primarily responsible for the implementation and integration of the Risk Management Program onsite with assistance from the Director of Plant Operations, Mr. Greg Evans. Environmental Specialist, Mr. Keith Lorenz, has assisted the Safety Specialist with the development of the Risk Management Program outlined in this RMP. Furthermore, it is the facility's policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job; therefore, many other site personnel will also be involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nb. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Bonnie View Plant is a 15,000 barrel per day (BPD) plant designed to fractionate natural gas liquids (NGLs) into ethane, propane, butane (normal butane and isobutane), pentanes and hexanes plus. The initial operations of this plant will involve storage of NGLs in three 60,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks. The NGL product in these tanks will be loaded into trucks for sale. \r\n\r\nAdministrative controls have been implemented that limit the liquid capacity of the tanks to no more than 95% of the design volume. The storage tanks will hold a combination of ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane and pentane, which are regulated flammable substances listed in the Risk Management Program rule and will be above the EPA's established threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds or at quantities"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Bonnie View Plant, as a process covered under Program 1, is not required to have a Prevention Program under the Risk Management Program rule. However, a similar Prevention Program to that outlined by the EPA's Risk Management Program has been established for this site because the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard. This RMP will not discuss that Prevention Program required by the OSHA PSM standard as it is not required for processes covered under Program 1.\r\n\r\nd. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Bonnie View Plant is a new site and does not have any accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in death, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage within the previous five years. \r\n\r\ne. Emergency Response Program Information\r\n\r\nA local emergency response plan has been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies to ensure that public health and the environment are protected. The following were in attendance at the Bonnie View Plant for the coordination of the emergency response plan:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tRefugio Volunteer Fire Department - Chief Don Pullen\r\n\u00bf\tWoodsboro Volunteer Fire Department - Chief Lee Riemenschneider\r\n\u00bf\tBayside Volunteer Fire Department - Chief Bob Cramer\r\n\u00bf\tRefugio County Memorial Hospital - CEO Louis Willeke\r\n\u00bf\tRefugio County Sheriff - Robert Bolcik\r\n\r\nThe initial coordination consisted of a meeting for the responders and plant operations personnel to introduce themselves. During this meeting the responders were able to familiarize themselves with the processes that take place at this location. To allow local emergency response departments to safely respond to an accidental release at the Bonnie View Plant, Southcross will be donating four-gas meters to the local fire departments. In addition, Southcross is coord"
