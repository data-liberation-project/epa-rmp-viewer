This Executive Summary is intended to satisfy those requirements.\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSimplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC is located in Pasco, Washington off Highway 12 in Franklin County.  This facility processes, freezes and stores vegetables and uses anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration process.  The facility employs approximately 375 full time staff and an additional 50 seasonal employees. The facility has residential subdivisions to the South with other surrounding areas used for industrial or agricultural purposes. \r\n\r\nThe Simplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC refrigeration process requires the use of one substance currently listed in the RMP rule.  This substance is anhydrous ammonia.  Simplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC uses anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the rule applicability threshold limits, therefore requiring the facility to develop a Risk Management Program and submit an associated plan.  Because the regulated substance is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and not eligible for Program 1, the refrigeration process is a Program 3 process under the RMP rule.   \r\n\t\t\r\nUnder the OSHA PSM Regulation, the facility is required to develop a process safety management program, which is near equivalent to the prevention program required by the Risk Management Program rule. Simplot Frozen Vegetables, LLC developed and implements both programs concurrently in accordance with both the EPA Risk Management and OSHA PSM requirements and OSHA interpretations.  The program for the covered refrigeration process establishes a multi-element program and management policies and procedures which facilitates the prevention of accidental releases and minimizes any potential release.
