If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify City of Preston Fire Department and Jackson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a retail fertilizer plant.  We sell fertilizer and pesticides to area farmers.  Anhydrous is used as a form of nitrogen for crop use.  Our storage system consists of 2 - 8,000 gallon tanks with plumbing.\n\nOur worst case scenerio is a gas release of one 8,000 gallon storage tank.  According to EPA's RMP Comp the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles. Included in this area is the city of Preston, population approximately 1100.\n\nThe Alternative release scenario is the break of a transfer hose which would have the potential of releasing 26,638 lbs. of anhydrous in 2 minutes. Emergency shutdown systems, including excess flow valve and breakaway couplers, will mitigate release. The distance to the endpoint is 2.2 miles affecting a population of 1000. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This anhydrous system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the Iowa Department of Ag & Land Stewardship.\n\nWe have never had and accident involving anhydrous that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the City of Preston Fire Department and Jackson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and fire department members have inspected our anhydrous system.\n\nSafety is an ongoing effort with the administration and employees working hand and hand to promote safety through training and a continued effo"
