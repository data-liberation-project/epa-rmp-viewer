Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility handles chlorine which is considered a hazardous material. The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is a nursery that produces a wide variety of perennials, conifers, woody ornamentals, shrubs, trees, citrus, camellias, rhododendrons, vines, ferns, grasses, and topiaries.  Chlorine gas systems are installed at five (5) pump stations, and is being installed at a sixth pump station at a new section, to eliminate pathogens from the water used at the facility on the products grown there.  Chlorine one-ton containers are in use and/or located at the following locations:\n\n1. At Reservoir #1 near the south-west side of the facility\n2. At Reservoir #2 near the south-east side of the facility\n3. At the river pump on the north-western side of the facility\n4. At the Recycling Station #1 at the Packwood Canal on the western-south side of the facility\n5. At the Recycling Station #2 on the south-western side of the facility\n6. At the new section on the south-east side of the new section located north-west of the main portion of the facility\n7. At the Storage Yard for full and empty one-ton containers on the west side of the Plant Protection Building near the west central side of the facility\n\nThere is a daily maximum of 40,000 lb of chlorine at the facility.\n\n3a. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the d"

This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine system and the training provided to the chlorine system operators.\n\n3b. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety meetings and safety training. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere were no accidental releases of chlorine during the last five-year period.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Woodlake Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated. The Tulare County - Environmental Health can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the State of California's Risk Management Plan (RMP) that are being implemented at this time. Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to"
