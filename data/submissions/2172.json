      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Orlando owns and operates the Water Conserv I Water Reclamation Facility, located at 11401 Boggy Creek Road in Orlando, Florida.  The Water Conserv I (WCI) facility has a design capacity of 7.5 million gallons per day and is classified as a Class A, Level I treatment plant.\n\nThe WCI facility was built to protect the Central Florida environment, especially in Orange County, with its zero discharge method of effluent reuse and recharge.  The highly treated effluent is utilized throughout the Orlando International Airport area as reuse water, and also recharges the surficial aquifer by means of rapid infiltration basins.\n\nLike the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the United States, gaseous chlorine is used at the WCI plant as a disinfectant to destroy pathogenic organisms in the treated water prior to reuse or aquifer recharge.  The popularity of chlorine as a water disinfectant is mainly due to its effectiveness and relatively low cost.\n\nThe same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine as a safeguard to our workers, our community, and the environment.  Chlorine is notably irritating to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  More serious human health effects could result from much higher chlorine exposure, such as intense coughing, chest pains, and in extreme cases, death.\n\nThe City of Orlando's commitment at the WCI is to store, handle and use chlorine in a manner that achieves the needed benefits of disinfection while minimizing both onsite and offsite risks.  This is accomplished by designing a safe process, maintaining the process in optimum working condition, operating safely through documented procedures and extensive training, and providing an emergency response capability to minimize the consequences of a chlorine release, should a process accident ever occur.  Our commitment to employee and community protection is de"

      "SummaryText": "monstrated in the fact that over WCI's entire operating history, there have been no chlorine accidents that resulted in death, serious employee injury or offsite consequences.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the City's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State of Florida and local rules and regulations.  This specifically includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules for chlorine accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe primary measures for accidental chlorine release prevention are contained in the document Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program for WCI.  This process safety management (PSM) document was prepared in conformance with the OSHA and EPA risk management rules, as well as industry-specific guidelines and best management practices relevant to release prevention.  WCI's Plant Manager has the responsibility for ensuring that this program is implemented in the workplace as written.\n\nThe WCI emergency response plan relies on a team of onsite trained personnel and, as necessary, offsite mutual-aid groups such as fire and rescue services.  The emergency response plans at WCI are based on the Incident Command system, where onsite responders work in coordination with local hazardous materials response teams to implement the WCI and regional response plans.  WCI's personnel receive annual chlorine emergency response training, which includes the donning of protective equipment and hands-on application of the chlorine cylinder repair kits kept at the plant.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine is received by the facility by truck and is stored in one-ton chlorine cylinders fabricated to Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications.  Upon arrival at the site, all chlorine cylinders are thoroughly inspected and if there is any doubt about the integrity of the cylinder, it is promptl"

      "SummaryText": "y refused.  Once accepted, the cylinders are stored inside an enclosed building equipped with a chlorine detector that immediately notifies the operators of a release should a leak occur.  Eight cylinders are connected to the disinfection process: four are in-use, and four are as standby.  The standby cylinders will automatically switchover when the in-use cylinders become empty, ensuring continuous disinfection.  The maximum intended chlorine inventory at WCI is 8 cylinders, or 16,000 pounds of chlorine used in the process.\n\nThe Worst-Case and Alternative Chlorine Release Scenarios\n\nAs part of WCI's emergency prevention and response efforts, a hazard assessment was conducted in compliance with EPA requirements contained in 40 CFR 68, Subpart B.  The hazard assessment included the development of worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nEPA defines a worst-case release as a scenario involving the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe.  In WCI's case, this involves the release of the entire contents of a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  The release is assumed to occur over a 10-minute period, and only the passive mitigating effects of the building enclosure are considered.  Applying the worst-case parameters to the WCI situation results in a distance to chlorine endpoint (defined as 0.0087 milligrams per liter) of 0.9 mile.  In other words, any human or environmental receptors within 0.9 mile of the chlorine storage building are within the worst-case distance.\n\nEPA defines an alternative release as a scenario more likely than the worst-case, but that nevertheless results in an impact offsite (unless no such release is possible).  Passive and active mitigation measures (chlorine detection, operator response, etc.) are considered in this scenario.  Without an accident history on which to base a more likely scenario, a scenario was selected based on information provided in the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 74, Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release.

      "SummaryText": " The scenario involved the release of chlorine liquid through a broken 0.25-inch diameter whip inside the building.  Response time is conservatively assumed to occur in 60 minutes.  This scenario results in a distance to chlorine endpoint of 0.1 mile.  There are no public or environmental receptors affected by this release.\n\nThe distance to endpoint calculations were performed using EPA's RMP*Comp model.  The RMP*Comp model was developed specifically for compliance with the accidental release prevention requirement for predicting the travel distance of an accidental release.        \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWCI's PSM document contains 13 essential release prevention elements.  Some of the key accidental release prevention elements of the PSM program are as follows:  \n\n* Process hazard analysis: This analysis was performed for each step in the chlorine process, to identify potential process failure scenarios and the appropriate prevention or response measures.  The process hazard analysis will be updated every 5 years.\n\n* Operating procedures review: The review was conducted to ensure that operators are given clear, written instructions for safely operating the chlorine process.\n\n* Training programs: Training is given to each employee assigned to the process with continuing operator training thereafter, with an emphasis on safe chlorine handling and emergency response.  The City has been on the forefront among utilities in chlorine safety training.\n\n* Contractors: The City ensures through its contract provisions that contractors supplying or working with chlorine are held to a standard of safety performance that complies with the City's safety goals and objectives, and also meets relevant agency requirements.  City personnel make visits to the supplier's site to ensure that rules and guidelines concerning chlorine and cylinder integrity are being followed.\n\n* Mechanical integrity: The integrity and reliability of t"

In addition to the 13 PSM elements, WCI has established related OSHA safety programs such as hot work and confined space.  These OSHA safety programs apply to both the City and contractor employees. \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at the WCI plant in the past five years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWCI plant operators are provided with annual chlorine safety training that includes hands-on practice of assessing and repairing a chlorine leak. Plant personnel also review the emergency response flow diagram and emergency plan on an annual basis.  The emergency response plan covers all aspects of emergency response including escape procedures and routes, procedures for employee accounting, notification procedures, medical duties, and response procedures for spills or leaks.  If a major chlorine leak were to occur, the emergency plan requires immediate notification of the regional hazardous materials response teams for assistance, including orderly evacuation or sheltering-in-place of the surrounding community.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe City is committed to continuously improving the safety of its operations for the benefit of its personnel, the citizens of Orlando and the environment.
