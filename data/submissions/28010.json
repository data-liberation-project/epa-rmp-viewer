      "SummaryText": "ORION REFINING CORPORATION\n\nORION REFINERY; NORCO, LA\nLA ID No. 26003\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\nThe Orion Refinery is owned and operated by Orion Refining Corporation, formerly operating as the TransAmerican Refining Corporation.  Orion Refinery is currently operating its Crude Unit, Vacuum Unit, Delayed Coking Unit, Milli-Second Catalytic Cracker (MSCC), Alkylation Unit, three Hydrodesulfurization Units, two Sulfur Units and associated utilities facilities.  The Continuous Catalytic Regeneration Reformer (CCR Reformer) was constructed and brought on line in December of 2002.  This facility represented the first new refining capability constructed in the United States over the last 19 years.  The new CCR Reformer will make this refinery one of the highest complexities, lowest-cost-feedstock refineries on the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe expanded process, catalytic reforming, is an important process used to convert low-octane naphtha\u00bfs into high-octane gasoline blending components called reformates.  Reforming represents the total effect of numerous reactions such as cracking, polymerization, dehydrogenation, and isomerization taking place simultaneously.  Depending on the properties of the naphtha feedstock (as measured by the paraffin, olefin, naphthene, and aromatic content) and catalysts used; high octane reformate can be produced with toluene, xylene, and other aromatics useful in gasoline blending and petrochemical processing.  Hydrogen, a significant by-product, is separated from the reformate for recycling and use in desulfurization processes.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about regulated substances and release scenarios at the facility, policies and programs to prevent accidental releases, emergency response planning, accident history and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  Each of these aspects are summarized below and fully detailed in the RMP.  This submittal is being presented as an upd"

      "SummaryText": "ate to the current RMP, which was submitted in October 1999.  This updated RMP is being submitted as a result of the commissioning of the CCR Reformer in December of 2002.  This submittal includes current facility information as well as population and sensitive receptor data from the 2000 Census Data (LandView V).\n\nRegulated Substances and Release Scenarios.  The Orion Refinery has six flammable substances in amounts estimated to exceed the Thresholds for covered substances.  They are Propane, Propylene/Propane mix, Butane, Isobutane, Butylene/Butane mix, and LPG.  There has been no change in the quantities of these regulated flammable substances in the facility from the previous RMP submittal.\n\nUsing the worst-case scenario specified for flammables by the EPA, a vapor cloud explosion of the largest vessel containing a regulated flammable substance, the Butylene/Butane sphere, would have the greatest impact.  Using the EPA model known as RMPComp (version 1.07), the distance impacted by such an explosion was calculated to be 1.4 miles.  Although numerous in-place controls prevent such an event from occurring, none of those controls are considered in modeling the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the worst of what is considered potential release scenarios.  Based on a review of existing Process Hazard Analysis documentation, a flange leak at the Propylene/Propane vessel was calculated to have the greatest off site impact by affecting up to 0.3 miles from the vessel.  No residential areas are located in the area of impact; however, a neighboring chemical facility would be affected if this scenario occurred.  A strategically placed isolation valve, an in-place water curtain safety feature, on site presence of a fire brigade, operator intervention, and other Emergency Response Team actions would be expected to reduce the distance of impact.\n\nPrevention Policies and Programs.  The Orion Refinery operates under the strict guidelines of the Occupatio"

      "SummaryText": "nal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Facility personnel strive for excellence in PSM by thoroughly integrating PSM into the organization\u00bfs culture.  The PSM program is designed to:\n\nReduce the potential for serious accidents\nIncrease plant reliability, efficiency and product quality\nMinimize the time and resources expended in achieving compliance\nPromote improved worker morale\nDiminish the potential for releases with environmental impact\nEnhance the company image in the community.\n\nEmergency Response Planning.  Orion Refinery has its own Emergency Response Team (ERT) to respond to all on site emergencies.  This team would coordinate with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) personnel during any incident with potential for off site impacts.  Copies of the Emergency Response Plan as well as ERT planning activities and exercises are coordinated with the DEP Director on an ongoing basis.\n\nAccident History.  Two reportable accidents related to RMP substances have occurred at the facility in the past five years.  The first incident occurred on June 7, 2001 as a result of a lightning strike on an oil storage tank.  The lightning strike resulted in an on-site fire, with a release of 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  Property damage was estimated to be over one million dollars while the off-site impacts included the sheltering in place of Parish Water Works personnel.\n\nThe second accident resulted in an on-site fire in the Coker Unit.  This accident occurred on January 29, 2003.  Coking is a severe method of thermal cracking used to upgrade heavy residuals into lighter products or distillates.  Coking produces straight-run gasoline (coker naphtha), diesel (light coker distillate), and a heavy distillate fraction used as catalytic cracking feedstock.  The fire in the coker unit was due to a pipeline failure resulting in release of hot heavy oil, with auto ignition of the product.  Damage on-site was"

      "SummaryText": "estimated to be over one million dollars.  Off-site impacts included temporarily closing two adjacent roads.  Environmental monitoring during this event indicated no hazardous air pollutants present offsite.  To limit the recurrence of coker unit fires, Orion Refinery has made improvements and upgrades to the affected equipment and revised the maintenance and inspection procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  Continuing compliance with PSM/RMP guidelines and regulations forms the basis of the refinery\u00bfs commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees as well as a safe community.  The facility benefits from the use of the latest technology in its processes as well as the assurance of the finest training of its employees.  Specific actions planned to improve safety include:\n\nEvaluation of process changes using Management of Change procedures to ensure safety and health\nContinual improvement in safety standards through application of the PHA process\nUse of process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, flares, shutoffs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypasses, emergency air and power supplies, backup pumps, grounding equipment, quench and purge systems and rupture disks to prevent or minimize releases\nUse of mitigation systems such as sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains and neutralization to reduce the impacts of any accidental releases\nUse of process area detectors to quickly identify and respond to emergencies.\n\nAdditional initiatives taken by Orion to enhance the refineries safety and environmental performance:\n\nOrion is a Pioneer member of NPRA's Responsible Care(r) program.  Responsible Care(r) is a program initiated in 1988 by the American Chemistry Council (ACC) formerly the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA). NPRA joined the ACC's Responsible Care(r) Partnership initiative in December 1998.  Through Responsible Care(r), member companies are committed to continuously improve the industry's health,"
