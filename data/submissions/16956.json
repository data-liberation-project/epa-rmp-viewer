THE FACILITY IS MANNED 7 DAY A WEEK 24 HOURS A DAY.WATER TREATMENT OPERATOR ARE RESPONABLE FOR CHECKING SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND FOLLOWING ALL SAFETY PROCEDURES.\n\nTHE OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF TWO ONE TON CHLORINE RELEASE SCENARIO,INDENTIFIED AS\" WORST CASE RELEASE\" AND \"ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\".THE WORST CASE BEING DEFINED AS THE LARGEST VESSEL... IS RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES\",DUE TO UNSPECIFIED FAILURE.THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS DEFINED AS THE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR THAN THE WORST CASE.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AT THE DICKSON WATER DEPT. INVOLVES A FAILURE OF THE TWO-TON-CONTAINERS WHICH COULD BE CONNECTED CONCURRENTLY (A TOTALF 4000 LB OF CHLORINE).  THE OFFSITE CONSEQENCE ANALYSIS FOR THIS SCENARIO WAS PERFORMED FOR TWO SETS OF CONDITIONS.  THE FIRST SET FOLLOWED CONDITIONS PRE-DEFINED BY EPA, NAMELY ERPG-2 AS THE TOXIC ENDPOINT, AND CONSIDERATION OF THE POPULATION RESIDING WITHIN A FULL CIRCLE RADIUS CORRESPONDING TO THE TOXIC ENDPOINT DISTANCE.  WHEN ATMOSPHERIC DISPERSION MODELING FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WAS PERFORMED USING THE EPA ASSUMPTIONS, A DISTANCE TO TOXIC ENDPOINT OF 1.3 MILES AND AN ESTIMATE OF RESIDENTIAL POPULATION POTENTIALLY AFFECTED OF 13000 WAS OBTAINED.  WHEN THE SAME MODELING WAS  PERFORMED WITH THE SECOND SET OF CONDITIONS, A DISTANCE TO TOXIC ENDPOINT OF .2 MILES AN ESTIMATE OF POPULATION POTENTIALLY AFFECTED OF 1000 RESULTED.                                                                                                                                                         \n\nTHE GENERAL DWP ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGR"
