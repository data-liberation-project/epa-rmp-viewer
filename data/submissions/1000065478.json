      "SummaryText": "Colonial Terminals, Inc. owns and operates a bulk storage and warehousing facility in Savannah, Georgia. Colonial Terminals, Inc. is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees.  The plant injects butane into gasoline to alter the octane rating. The butane is unloaded from 180,000 lb. railcars and blended into the atmospheric gasoline storage tanks. The butane unloading process is subject to EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nThe plant has developed and implemented a Process Safety/Risk Management Program for the butane unloading process that consists of the following elements: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Incident Investigation, Hot Work Permitting, Contractor Safety and Compliance Audits. A management team consisting of qualified management personnel located onsite is responsible for enforcement and oversight of the above elements of the Process Safety/Risk Management Program. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response to any potential incident at the plant is accomplished in accordance with the site's Integrated Contingency Plan. The Integrated Contingency Plan identifies response capabilities and complies with requirements of OSHA, EPA, USCG, and Georgia EPD. The plan is tested annually for effectiveness. There have been no RMP reportable accidental releases from the facility in the past 5 years. The most recent PHA included several recommendations that will result in equipment and procedure improvements in the near future to mitigate identified risks.\n\n"
