The Commission operates three reservoirs, with a total capacity of 14 billion gallons, to ensure a reliable water supply for all seasons and conditions.\n\n\tSix wastewater treatment plants operated by WSSC provide sewage treatment. Every day an average of 181 million gallons of wastewater from Prince George\u0012s and Montgomery Counties move to facilities through 4,900 miles of sewers maintained by WSSC.  The six WSSC wastewater treatment plants have a combined capacity of over 73 million gallons per day (mgd). Under the Inter-municipal Agreement, WSSC is allocated 169 mgd of Blue Plains\u0012 370 mgd capacity.

The Division is responsible for the operational readiness of treatment plants currently not in service so that they are capable of being placed back in service when needed.  The Division also provides support for other organizations within the Commission, such as the Systems Maintenance Division, and the Industrial Discharge Control Section, by assisting in developing research projects and testing.  Support is also given to organizations outside the Commission, such as the US Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, Maryland Environmental Services, and the Maryland Department of the Environment.\n\n\tThe Division operates six wastewater treatment plants, with an average daily flow of 73 mgd.  In addition to the seven plants there are thirty-nine (39) wastewater-pumping stations operated by the Division.  Five (5) of the wastewater treatment plants are covered by the CAAA 112 (r) requirements; two of the plants do not use the EPA threshold chemicals. \n\nWESTERN BRANCH WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT  \n\nWestern Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant is an advanced wastewater treatment facility that serves an area of about 113 square miles  in Prince George's County, Maryland.  This drainage basin includes parts of Bowie, Glenn Dale, and Largo in its northern sector and stretches down to Upper Marlboro in its southern sector.  The drainage basin has a population of approximately 150,000 people.  The plant processes over 6 billion gallons of wastewater a year, an average of over 16 million gallons a day.\n\n\tThe Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission built the Western Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant in the late 1960's.  It began treating wastewater in January 1970 as a 5 million gallon per day (mgd) plant.  However, within a couple of years, it became evident that expansion and upgrading of the plant would be necessary due to rapidly increasing flows to the plant.  In 1973, the project that is today known as Phase I be"

It increased the capacity of the plant to treat 15 mgd of wastewater.  Phase I used biological treatment systems, clarifiers, polishing filters, and chlorine contact basins to treat the wastewater.  The solids taken out of the water were dewatered and then incinerated.  However, the population in the drainage basin continued to increase.  Further expansion was deemed necessary, so Phase II was built,  an exact duplicate of Phase I.  It was built next to Phase I and increased the capacity of the plant to 30 mgd.  Phase II went into operation in April 1980.\n\n\tUnder the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), the State of Maryland issues discharge permits to all state wastewater plants. The regulations vary according to type, location, and size of the plant. Over the last several years the Chesapeake Bay has been undergoing a major clean-up effort.  Part of the clean-up involved the issuing of very stringent discharge permits to plants discharging into the Bay or into its tributaries.  The Western Branch discharge permit is one of the most limiting in the State of Maryland.  The treated water from this plant flows into the Western Branch, which flows into the Patuxent River.  The Patuxent River is the largest tributary flowing into the Chesapeake Bay that is wholly contained within the State of Maryland.\n\n \tWestern Branch is an advanced wastewater treatment plant because of its ability to remove large amounts of pollutants from the wastewater. Some of the substances regulated at the Western Branch WWTP are Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Suspended Solids (SS), Phosphorous (P), Ammonia (NH3) and Total Nitrogen (N).  Western Branch WWTP has been highly efficient in removing these substances.  The plant regularly achieves 99% removal for BOD, SS, and NH3.  Also over 80% of Phosphorous is removed.  In addition, over 90% of Total Nitrogen is removed"

Phosphorous and Nitrogen are substances that tend to promote excessive plant life.  The more plants grow, die off and sink, the more oxygen they take away from the water.  Subsequently, fishes and other aquatic animals will slowly disappear due to a low dissolved oxygen in the water.  Another problem with overabundance of nutrients is production of surface algae, which in turn interferes with sunlight reaching submerged aquatic vegetation.  The construction of the Nutrient Removal Processes at Western Branch was the first of its kind in this area.  The cost was approximately $38 million.  To assist with operating these processes, a computer monitoring and control system was provided.\n\n\tThe operators staff the plant around the clock, 7 days/week.  All operators must pass two written exams administered by the State of Maryland to be a licensed Wastewater Plant Operator.  The minimum plant staffing at any time is 3 operators. The average years of experience for Western Branch operators are over 15 years. Because of this well trained, experienced staff, very few emergencies are encountered due to preventive measures.  When an emergency or unusual situations develops, plant management is on-call to the plant.  In addition, an Emergency Duty Engineer is available for assistance.

The RMP requirement is essentially an expansion of the OSHA Process Safety requirement and the Employee and Community Right to Know programs that have been in existence for a number of years.   \n\nHazardous material has always been recognized as a unique hazard for our employees and the public; therefore, we have made every possible effort to ensure the proper and safe use of all hazardous materials.  WSSC\u0012s chemical safety prevention program includes: the availability of personal protective equipment; obtaining and use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS); designing facilities for safety and accident prevention; training and educating employees on chemical systems and processes;  planning and practicing for emergency situations; requiring consultants and contractors to abide by established safety practices; sharing of information with employees, contractors and consultants; conducting periodic inspection and audit reviews of chemical process systems; and formulating  policies and procedures for an effective chemical handling processes. \n\t\n\tWestern Branch places great emphasis on safety.  Everyone is taught safety first, and that no job can be completed without following proper safety procedures.  Extensive safety training is required of all employees.\n\n\tEach year, operators must attend the following courses:\n\n\t\t\t0\tSelf Contained Breathing Apparatus\n\t\t\t0\tChlorine Repair Kit\n\t\t\t0\tChlorine Leak Drill \n\t\t\t0\tCPR\n\t\t\t0\tSlips and Falls Prevention\n\t\t\t0\tRight-to-Know\n\t\t\t0\tLockout/Tagout\n\t\t\t0\tConfined Space\n\n\tThese courses were developed by Wastewater Division personnel, and are taught by the"

We determined that better instructor development coupled with more hands-on training will improve comprehension.  The Safety Coordinator position is rotated among qualified, Fully Certified Operators.  Before becoming a Safety Coordinator, an operator must complete a 3-day training class.\n\n\tIn addition to conducting training classes, Safety Coordinators perform inspections, investigate accidents, conduct weekly safety meetings, coordinate vehicle repairs, and correct plant safety problems.  The yearly rotation of an operator into Safety Coordinator position gets more operators directly involved in safety, promotes the concept of safety being everyone's job, and provides a fresh approach to Safety.\n \t\t\n\tThe plant safety program is a part of the overall WSSC program.  WSSC safety professionals provide assistance on many safety matters.  They assist with developing training courses, investigating accidents, correcting unsafe conditions, providing physicals and random drug and alcohol tests for CDL drivers, and ensuring chemicals are handled properly.  Each year a safety specialist (in conjunction with the plant Safety Coordinator) performs a detailed inspection of the plant to ensure we meet all safety requirements. \n\tAll of the needed safety equipment is supplied by the WSSC.  This includes coveralls, rain suits, chemical-handling suits, hard hats, breathing apparatus, various types of gloves, eye protection equipment, manhole retrieval equipment, atmosphere testing meters, and well maintained vehicles.  Our position is that all needed safety equipment and training is provided to each employee.  Therefore, we accept no excuses for failure to work safely. \n\n\tThe Safety program is clearly a success.  Accidents and injuries are at very low levels.

      "SummaryText": "dents.  A plant record of 1,412 consecutive days without a lost-time accident was set recently.  The rare lost-time accident was minor, did not involve serious injury, and did not involve chemical handling.  Western Branch shines in another category.  The plant has worked over 5 years since the last preventable vehicle accident.  This is an on-going plant record.  In 1992, the Chesapeake Water Environment Association awarded Western Branch it's George W. Burke Safety Award for an excellent safety record.  Once again, training and an experienced staff are the keys to this success.\n\n\tManagement decided years ago that formal recognition of safe working employees was a good idea.  For each injury-free quarter, the plant receives an award.  For each injury-free year, the plant receives a plaque.  Individuals are also recognized. Every two consecutive injury-free years are rewarded with a safety jacket.  It is felt that recognition demonstrates the management commitment to Safety.  The small amount of money spent on these recognition\u0012s is a cost savings to our overall prevention of accidents and injuries.\n\n\tThe employees of Western Branch are very proud of the plant's award winning performance. Every year but two since 1986, Western Branch has received the Gold Award from the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies.  This Award signifies a perfect compliance record with the plant NPDES discharge permit. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation designated Western Branch as Maryland\u0012s best wastewater treatment plant in 1987.  In 1989, 1991, and 1996, Western Branch received Operations & Maintenance Excellence Awards from EPA Region III.  EPA selected Western Branch for a National Award in 1997 for being the best large, advanced wastewater treatment plant in the country.  The plant also received a Governor's Award of Excellence for Biological Nutrient Removal efforts.  Because of the plant's excellent operating record, Western Branch has become a well-known wastewater treatment p"
