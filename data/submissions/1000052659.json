The primary activity at the Centennial Gas Plant (Facility) is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold to offsite facilities.  The purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to strive for the prevention of NGL accidental releases from the Facility and to reduce the severity of any releases which may occur.\n\n\n\nThe flammable regulated chemical mixture at the CGP Facility is Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include N-Pentane, Isopentane, N-Butane, Isobutane, Propane and Ethane.  These regulated chemicals have a RMP regulated threshold quantity limit (TQL) of 10,000 pounds.  The chemical abstract service (CAS) number for NGL is not applicable.  However the CAS number for the individual constituents are as follows:  Pentane 109-66-0, Isopentane 78-8-4, Butane 106-97-8, Isobutane 75-28-5, Propane 74-98-6, Ethane 74-84-0 and Methane 74-82-8.\n\n\n\nThe Centennial Facility stores up to 192,000 gallons of NGL in 8 above ground storage tanks.  The tanks contain a maximum of 789,120 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals.  This facility also stores the following in above ground storage tanks.\n\n- 4 Condensate Tanks, 30,000 Gal\n\n- 1 Slug Catcher, 30,000 Gak\n\n- 1 Light Oil, 30,000 Gal\n\n- 2 Produced Water, 400 BBL\n\n- 1 De-mineralized Water, 400 BBL\n\n- 1 Second Drain, 100 BBL\n\n- 4 Unused Tanks, 2000 Gal\n\n\n\nThe RMP*COMPTM program developed by the CAMEO team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness "

The worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the total quantity of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank formed a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which detonates. For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (PSI) for vapor cloud explosions.  The release parameters are:  wind speed 1/5 meters per second (m/s) and atmospheric stability F.\n\n\n\nUsing the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure and the data contained in the RMP*COMPTM program, the WCRS distance was calculated at 0.4 miles from the Facility.  Based on a site visit of the adjacent properties within a 0.4 mile radius of the facility, the population within the WCRS area is zero (0).  Public receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.4 miles of the Facility, were not observed based on review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps.  The Facility was commissioned in 2014 and has not had an NGL release.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Program which includes an Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment.  The Emergency Response Plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing and maintenance.  In the even of an NGL accident, first aid procedures for exposure, as well as procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the appropriate local authorities.  A site map, SDSs and"
