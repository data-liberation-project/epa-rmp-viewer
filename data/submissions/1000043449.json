The ERP includes the names and phone numbers not only of company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractor, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance. Liaison with these agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nWilliams Ohio Valley Midstream LLC, believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon.  Williams continues to look for, develop, and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Williams also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is high priority."

Williams Ohio Valley Midstream LLC is committed to the safety and health of its employees, contractors and visitors.  This commitment is demonstrated in the design, installation, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Moundsville Fractionator is located approximately 3 miles Southwest of Moundsville, West Virginia; Marshall County.  It is a natural gas liquid (NGL) fractionation plant that is designed to separate liquid petroleum products (ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from a natural gas liquid mixture.  The plant contains an above threshold quantity of regulated flammable substances, including ethane, propane, butane, pentane (liquid petroleum products), and ethyl mercaptan. There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances present at the Moundsville Fractionator.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Moundsville Fractionator has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program that consists of a detailed facility mechanical integrity program and employee training program.  The mechanical integrity program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written recommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history.  Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding of facility operation and ma"
