This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nUS Energy Partners\u00bf policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain and control the release, as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe US Energy Partners Ethanol Plant is located in the City of Russell, Russell County, Kansas.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The only substance regulated under the RMP Program is denaturant, which contains regulated flammable chemicals such as propane, isopentane, and butane.  US Energy Partners has evaluated denaturants from several suppliers with the RMP Comp program and determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release remains the same.  This is due primarily to the fact that available denaturants are fairly similar in composition.  As such, this RMP is submitted to cover any denaturant stored at the facility, regardless of the supplier.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of denaturant stored in a 39,000 gallon aboveground storage tank followed by ignition of the resulting vapor cloud. The worst-case scenario is based on the release of a full tank (39,000 gallons). The worst-case vapor cloud explosion generates a 1 psig over-pressure endpoint approximately 0.4 miles from the center of the plant. There are no public receptors, environmental rece"

As such, there have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA\u00bfs General Guidance on Risk Management Programs during US Energy Partners\u00bf ownership.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe US Energy Partners Ethanol Plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health & Safety Plan.  The facility is currently complying with standards under 40 CFR 112.  A Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC) will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.  \n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  US Energy Partners\u00bf corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nA safety inspection and a review of the facility\u00bfs emergency response plan is pending facility start-up."
