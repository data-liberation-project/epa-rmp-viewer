      "SummaryText": "FMC CORPORATION\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS GROUP\nBALTIMORE, MARYLAND\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nIn an effort to proactively inform the community of changes occurring at the facility, the FMC Corporation, Agricultural Products Group (APG) Baltimore Plant has prepared this revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) for resubmission to the EPA.  This is the Baltimore Plant's third revision since the original submission date in June 1999.  The changes incorporated in this revision reflect the removal of a previously reported process and its associated chemical inventory.  The Baltimore Plant no longer manufactures sulfentrazone and as a result, the inventory of nitric acid, oleum, and acetaldehyde stored onsite has been eliminated.  The chlorine inventory remains unchanged. There is no change to the plant's worst-case toxic and flammable release scenario reported previously.  \n\nThe FMC APG Baltimore Plant manufacturing facility is committed to protecting the safety and health of employees, contractors, customers, the surrounding community and the environment.  Furthermore, it is committed to conducting business in a manner that is compatible with the balanced environmental needs of the community in which it operates. This commitment requires compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, facilities that are designed and operated to high standards, and systematic identification and management of safety, health, and environmental risks. \n\nIn keeping with this commitment, the FMC APG Baltimore Plant has established a comprehensive Safety Management System that strives to identify and eliminate potential exposures that include, but are not limited to, personal injury/illness, property damage, fires, process incidents, and breaches of security. \n\nThe Safety Management System embodies and employs the spirit and intent of the concepts found in the American Chemistry Council's (ACC's) Responsible Care Management System Initiative, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, the EPA's Risk"

No job is so important that we cannot take time to perform our work safely.\" \n \nThe Safety Management System also includes the following Process Safety Vision statement:\n\n\"The employees at FMC Baltimore are dedicated to developing, implementing and operating sound process safety programs, maintaining compliance with both internal FMC and external requirements, improving process safety program performance using a risk-benefit approach, and addressing process safety and risk management issues and concerns in a timely manner.\n\nFMC Baltimore is fully committed to the Responsible Care initiatives: Process Safety, Employee Safety and Health, Distribution, Pollution Prevention, Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER), and Product Stewardship.\n\nFMC Baltimore achieves compliance with Responsible Care codes through workplace health and safety programs as well as release and waste generation reduction programs.  These programs ensure that FMC Baltimore is operated in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of personnel and the public.\"\n\nThe management of the FMC APG Baltimore Plant has authorized specific risk management-related programs and activities in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program ruling (40 CFR Part 68).

The plant's end products are shipped offsite for formulation and distribution to external users.  The processes covered by the EPA's Risk Management Program requirements at this facility include the MAC (methallyl chloride) Process, and the Clomazone Process.\n\nThe MAC Process includes the regulated chemicals chlorine (CAS Number 007782-50-5) and isobutylene (CAS Number 000115-11-7).  The Clomazone Process includes the regulated chemical anhydrous hydrogen chloride (CAS Number 007647-01-0). \n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of chemicals, FMC Baltimore has implemented several precautionary measures.  These measures include process and equipment controls, operating procedures, preventive maintenance programs, safe work practices, employee training, and audit programs.  In addition, all process equipment and systems are designed and constructed in accordance with recognized chemical industry codes and standards.\n\nThe Baltimore Plant has developed and implemented a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) program covering the storage, use and handling of the plant's chemicals.  As part of this program, the plant's processes are periodically evaluated to analyze all of the potential hazards associated with each process, including the potential to release chemicals. \n\nThe Baltimore Plant has also developed Standard Operating Procedures governing all employees and contractors that work in the facility.  These procedures incorporate safety measures to prevent employee injury, equipment damage, and accidental releases.  Additional Safe Work Procedures have also been developed to address the hazards associated with specific work activities performed in the plant.

This program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that process equipment, and their associated systems, are maintained in a safe operating condition.  Routine inspections are performed and equipment checklists are used to provide advanced notice of potential maintenance and repair needs.\n\nTo ensure that the control measures at the Baltimore Plant are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled compliance audits are performed.  In accordance with the PSM program and FMC's corporate requirements, comprehensive Process Safety and Risk Management Program audits are conducted by an outside team of experts every three years.  In addition, the facilities and records of the Baltimore Plant are periodically inspected and audited by the following agencies and organizations:\n\nThe Maryland State Occupational Safety and Health Program (MOSH)\nThe Maryland State Department of the Environment (MDE)\nThe Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD)\nThe United States Coast Guard (USCG)\nFactory Mutual\n\nIn addition, loss prevention and risk management audits are conducted by outside organizations for plant insurance purposes.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nDuring the five years immediately prior to the date of this report, no accidental releases meeting the reporting requirements for this RMP were experienced at the Baltimore Plant.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nThe FMC Baltimore Plant has a multi-faceted Emergency Management Program for response to the various types and magnitudes of emergencies that could potentially occur at the facility.

Some of these changes are currently underway and several others including equipment upgrades, additional preventive maintenance procedures and additional safety systems are planned for implementation over the course of the next year. \n\nThe Clomazone PHA Revalidation was in progress and near completion at the time this report was prepared."
