Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Falcon Safety Products, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl].  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used as an aerosol propellant.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used as an aerosol propellant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] at our facility is 75000.00 lb. while Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 50500.00 lb..\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from A-31.  In this scenario 41500 lb. of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is released. It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calcu"

The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 36276.26 lb. of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.14 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from 152a.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 66000 lb. of Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.11 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Warehouse.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 0.5 lb. of Flammable Mixture: Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] in  minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as sprinkler system(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include sprinkler system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.00 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nFalcon Safety Products, Inc. mainta"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/06/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Falcon Safety Products, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nFalcon Safety Products, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nFalcon Safety Products, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  "
