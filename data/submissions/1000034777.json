Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\n     Struktol Company of America is strongly committed to the prevention of accidental releases of ethylenediamine and the safety  of our employees.  We have a comprehensive release prevention program that covers release prevention and emergency response.  We have an active working relationship with the Cuyahoga Falls Fire Department who provide us with the necessary expertise in both release cleanup and emergency response.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Source of  the Regulated Substance\r\n\r\n     The ethylenediamine is stored in a 10,000 gallon stainless steel storage tank located outside and behind Building 2.  The tank is fully diked to prevent the release of material to the ground.  The tank is vented through a Trigg vapor recovery system.  The maximum amount of ethylenediamine in the tank at any one time is 44,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.  Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\n     See RMP Plan\r\n\r\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\n     Our facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release requirements as set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Struktol Company of America has conducted Process Hazard Analysis to identify and control any and all hazards of ethylenediamine.  We have written procedures for the unloading of the material.  All affected employees are trained in SOP for ethylenediamine.  Struktol Company of America will inspect the ethylenediamine tank, piping system and vent system on a five year basis.  Maintenance checks"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\n     We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing training to ensure that they are current with all of the proper and safe procedures for the handling and transfer of ethylenediamine and provide regular inspection and maintenance of all equipment.  Only authorized personnel will make any chnages necessary if a non-compliance is identified."
