It also reaffirms the corporate commitment of DHL Supply Chain, from site facility personnel through regional support specialists and corporate health, safety and environmental managers.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\no\tDHL Supply Chain has internal procedures that encompass the safe and proper handling, storage and transportation of the products that are warehoused on site. These procedures minimize both the frequency and severity of any accidental releases. On the rare possibility of a release, DHL Supply Chain follows the protocol that protecting lives is more important than protecting property. Employees are trained to alert fellow workers and then the fire department. Should a release exceed the capabilities of in-house personnel, response contractors and the fire department are provided the information they need to safely remedy the situation.\n\nDHL Supply Chain 3M Ontario and Regulated Substances Present\no\tDHL Supply Chain 3M Ontario warehouses and distributes a variety of products, primarily packaged in small containers intended for consumer use. These containers are not opened on-site for any process. There are four substances that are present in quantities subject to the EPA's Risk Management Program: Isobutane (CAS # 75-28-5), Methyl Ether (CAS # 115-10-6), Propane (CAS # 74-98-6), and Difluoroethane (CAS #75-37-6). All four of these materials are flammable gases used for propellants in aerosol cans.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \no\tIn addition to a strong accident prevention program that underpins compliance with Federal, state and local regulatory requirements, flammable materials are inspected to verify container integrity upon arrival. Those products not destined for immediate outbound shipment are sequestered in a separate, sprinklered storage area. Mo"

      "SummaryText": "torized and pedestrian areas as well as storage/staging areas are clearly delineated.\n\nFive Year Accident History\no\tIn the five years preceding submittal of this plan, including the time frame under previous management, there were no accidental releases with on-site or off-site consequences that meet EPA criteria for inclusion with this plan.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\no\tThe emergency response plan for this facility include elements that address the responsibilities of our employees to releases or threatened releases of potentially hazardous materials, including notification of co-workers, regulatory bodies, public agencies and the corporate NEAR network. The NEAR network is staffed by highly trained, experienced individuals who can advise facility personnel on the proper mitigation steps for a release. Planning and training are also key elements of the emergency response plan, allowing the opportunity to verify and/or modify current practices and procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\no\tAnalysis of facility data such as Injury and Illness Records, Internal Audits, Safety Inspections combined with data from other DHL Supply Chain operations, including corporate safety staff and outside consultants is utilized to identify opportunities for improvement. Best Management Practices from related operations are evaluated against current practices to facilitate continual improvement and minimize risks to both the employees and the general public.\n\nConclusion\no\tThe Ontario facility, through the efforts of on-site personnel supported by dedicated technical specialists, has produced and maintained a low risk climate that safely stores and subsequently distributes a wide variety of products to a myriad of end users."
