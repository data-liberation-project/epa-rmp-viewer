The facility includes two covered processes, a propane rail offloading and truck distribution process with intermediate storage and a butane rail offloading system that directly feeds an adjacent facility.  The Risk Management Plan covers the above processes including storage of up to 12 propane railcars and 18 butane railcars, six 60,000 gallon propane vessels, one 30,000 butane vaporizer, four 1,000 gallon utility propane vessels, and associates transfer equipment, piping, and instruments.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Energy Services, LLC - Macungie Terminal 2BE covered processes were constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association Code #58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage and it is the Facility's policy to follow the most current future editions to the extent feasible and adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local codes/laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Lower Macungie Fire Department and the Lehigh County Emergency Management Agency, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Macungie Ambulance Corps and Lehigh Valley Hospital.  The primary hospital response is provided through the Lehigh Valley Hospital (a Level 1 Trauma Center).  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe covered processes at Buckeye Energy Services, LLC - Macungie Terminal 2BE comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D- Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all "

Additionally, the local Emergency Response Action Plan was updated to reflect the addition of butane and propane.\n\n\n\nThis Facility has never had an accident or incident involving the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the covered processes at Macungie Terminal 2BE, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Lower Macungie Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the Lower Macungie Fire Department and the Lehigh County Emergency Management Agency.  The fire department is aware of the Facility's butane and propane operations, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.\n\n\n\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety.  Also, Buckeye is implementing a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles and is developing \"global\" operating procedures.\n\n"
