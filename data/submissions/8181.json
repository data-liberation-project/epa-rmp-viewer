This program continues the Town's commitment to the\nprotection of its employees and the control of the potential for such a release.  To date, no such\nrelease has ever occurred at the plant.\n\nThe Cary/Apex Water Treatment Facility is located on Wimberly Road in Apex.  The primary\npurpose of the facility is to treat and disinfect raw water pumped from Jordan Lake and distribute\nthe treated water for use in the Cary, Apex, and Morrisville areas.  Currently, chlorine is used at\nthe Cary/Apex WTF as a disinfection agent to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.\n\nAs part of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, any facility storing more than the Threshold\nQuantity of 2,500 lbs. of chlorine must submit a Risk Management Plan to the Environmental\nProtection Agency.  As part of the disinfection process the Cary/Apex WTF stores, on site, up to\n16,000 lbs. of chlorine.\n\nProgram Summary\n\nThe RMP program supplements the procedures described in other Town of Cary documents such\nas general administrative guidelines and safety and health manuals.  The RMP program addresses\nemployee training, operating procedures, safe work practices, contractor safety, emergency\nresponse procedures, and a hazard review.\n\nThe Town has implemented a training program with guidelines for conducting regular, structured\nprocess training for Town employees.  Training record forms document the required training. \nThe training records for all personnel associated with the covered processes appear in the training\nfiles and logbooks kept at the Cary/Apex WTF.\n\nThe Town has adopted standard operating procedures (SOPs) that provide system descriptions,\nspecifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine systems.  The procedures address\nstartup, shutdown, inspections, tem"

Additionally, an Emergency Response\nProcedure documents the measures the Town will take to control process upsets and chlorine\nreleases.\n\nA hazard review was conducted for each regulated process.  The hazard review team consisted of\nthe plant management, process operation and maintenance experts, outside process design\nengineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the hazard review process itself. The hazard review\nteam used a \"what-if\" technique to evaluate the current procedures in place at the WTF and to\ngenerate ideas on where the procedures could be improved.\n\n\nTo help keep the program updated and observed, detailed program management procedures have\nbeen developed.  These procedures call for employee participation in control and analysis of\nchlorine hazards and the development of precautions to prevent chlorine releases. Before\nmodifications can be made to the chlorine system, the RMP program calls for a management of\nchange analysis to be performed to determine what, if any, impacts the change will have on the\nsafety of the chlorine system.  Any major modifications will require a pre-startup safety review\nwhere all employees are informed of the changes to the system as well as the revised operating\nprocedures.  Finally, in the event of a release, the program requires a complete investigation and\nreport to be completed.\n\nAccidental Release/Emergency Response\n\nTo help reduce the possibility of an accidental release, the staff at the Cary/Apex WTF follows a\nstrict preventative maintenance schedule, which has been documented as part of the RMP\nprogram.  This maintenance schedule is aimed at keeping all of the equipment and materials of\nthe chlorine system functioning properly, and identifying possible sources of system failure.

      "SummaryText": "e schedule, the hazard review team identified several areas where the\nstandard operating procedures could be modified to reduce the possibility of a chlorine release. \nThese modifications have since been integrated into the existing procedures.\n\nShould a release occur, there are chlorine sensors located in the sensitive areas of the plant,\nwhich will alert the staff of the release.  Every employee of the Town and its contractors must\nremain aware of the potential for chlorine releases and disturbance of the chlorine system.  When\nemployees observe a release of chlorine or a condition that is likely to lead to a release (such as a\nbroken chlorine solution pipe), they shall take the following actions, in a way that does not place\nthem at increased risk.\n\n- Secure the area, if possible.  This might include closing doors, closing valves, and/or \nwarning nearby employees, \n-  Immediately notify the inside operator or supervisory staff of the incident by any means         possible, unless doing so would expose the employee to a serious hazard,\n- Make sure the inside operator or supervisory staff notifies emergency response agencies           by dialing 911, and\n-  Evacuate the area.  \n\nResponse by the Cary/Apex WTF to an actual or imminent chlorine release will occur under the\ndirection of the local emergency response agencies.  \n\nPlanned Improvements\n\nIt is anticipated that construction on a 16-mgd expansion to the Cary/Apex WTF will begin by\nthe summer of 2000.  As part of this upgrade, the Cary/Apex WTF will be switching from\nchlorine to ozone as a primary means of water disinfection.  A sodium hypochlorite system will\nalso be constructed for use as a supplemental means of disinfection and for providing a\ndisinfectant residual in the water distribution system.  The construction of the new hypochlorite\nsystem will most likely be one of the first activities undertaken as part of the upgrade.
