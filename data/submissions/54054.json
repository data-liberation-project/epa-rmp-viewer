      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Meeker Gas Plant is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors and the surrounding community and the environment.  This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility.  This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local agencies are trained to respond, minimize and eliminate any exposure that would occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Meeker Gas Plant is located near Meeker, Colorado and is a facility which receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site. The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane and a pentane natural gasoline mixture that are delivered to market via transportation vehicles.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.  \n\nHazard Assessment \u00bf Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is a release of a flammable mixture that would result as a failure of a natural gas liquids storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere having an offsite impact.  EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp\u00bf was used to calculate this release scenario.  This type of scenario is unlikely to occur.  In addition, qualifi"

The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\nHazard Assessment \u00bf Alternative Release Scenario\nAn Alternative Release Scenario was not explored for this facility as it falls under a Level  1 Risk Management Plan.\n\nTraining\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines.  In addition to training required of all employees, personnel having specific responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are aptly trained in those procedures.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nThe Meeker Gas Plant  has had no releases of listed Hazardous Substances which have resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Meeker Gas Plant has a written emergency response procedure to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment.  These procedures address all aspects of emergency response including response to a regulated substance release including the possibility of a fire or explosion in the event that a flammable substance is accidently released.  Procedures also address evacuation, accounting for personnel and company and agency notification.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or facility. The overall emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders including local law enforcement and"

This is done through training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date information available.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."
