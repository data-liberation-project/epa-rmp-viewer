Management systems in compliance with the applicable regulations have been developed to prevent the release of regulated substances, especially in locations which may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nThe Fort James LLC Camas Mill has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement process controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nES.2   DESCRIPTION OF CAMAS MILL, REGULATED SUBSTANCES AND REGULATED PROCESSES\n\nMill Description\n\nThe Fort James LLC Camas Mill is located on 185 acres adjacent to the Columbia River in Clark County, Washington.  It has occupied this site since 1883 when it was constructed to supply newsprint for the Portland area. \n\nThe Mill currently produces over 600,000 tons per year of cut size, tissue, toweling and communication papers.  Raw materials in the form of wood chips, sawdust, waste paper and pulp arrive from all over the Northwest by truck, barge and rail car.\n\nThe Camas Mill uses both the kraft and magnesium bisulfite (MgO) processes to convert wood chips and sawdust into brown pulp.  The pulp is then bleached i"

Most of the paper grades produced contain a blend of this pulp and as well as purchased pulp and secondary fiber recycled from waste paper.\n\nPaper is made on twelve different machines, half of them producing towel and tissue grades and the other half communication paper grades.  The oldest machine dates from 1910 and the newest from 1984.  Daily production ranges from 30 tons per day on the smallest to over 600 tons per day on the newest and largest.  Rolls of paper from the machines are sold directly to printers and converters or further processed into finished goods.  The mill also operates a pulp dryer to produce baled pulp for internal use or sale to outside customers.\n\nWaste water is treated and discharged to the main channel of the Columbia River.  The clarifier, aeration ponds and waste fiber landfill are located on Lady Island, a 476 acre site separated from the mill by the Camas Slough.\n\nThe Camas Mill employs about 1470 people from the local area.  Most processes operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 52 weeks a year.   Production equipment can be shut down for maintenance or to control output.  The entire facility is shut down periodically for maintenance and cleaning.\n\nRegulated Substances and Processes\n\nThe Camas mill stores two chemicals above the threshold limits of 40 CFR 68.130.  Chlorine is stored at the bleach plant in 90-ton rail cars and a 450 gallon level tank, and at the water filter plant in 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine dioxide, manufactured in the Lurgi and R-8 systems, is stored in tanks located in the bleach plant.\n\nES.3    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS AT THE CAMAS MILL\n\nEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68) requires industries to demonstrate that they have implemented an Accident Prevention Program.  This section briefly describes the elements of the Fort James LLC Camas Mill program.\n\nA program has been developed to comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Ma"

The Camas mill employs the Incident Command System (ICS) which parallels the National Interagency ICS.  This is an all risk system utilized for on-scene management of any emergency event.  The ICS is functionally oriented around five major areas:  (1) command, (2) operations, (3) planning, (4) logistics, and (5) finance (administration).  In a major incident the response command could consist of a unified command group containing mill personnel and local, state, and federal agency representatives.  The ICS includes eight crucial components:  common terminology, modular organization, integrated communications unified command structure, consolidated action plans, manageable span of control (3-7 people), predesignated incident facilities, and comprehensive resource management.  These components work together to provide the direction and control for effective response proportional to the severity of the incident.  Measures for incident termination, post-incident cleanup and documentation requirements are also included.\n\nThe Camas mill emergency preparedness program addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment, and training and instructions that address use of this equipment.
