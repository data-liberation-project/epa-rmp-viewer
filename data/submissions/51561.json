      "SummaryText": "The International Paper Georgetown Mill is committed to operating in a manner that provides safety of its employees and neighbors and for the protection of the environment.  A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals.  Controls have been implemented to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to stop, control, contain and clean up the releases.\n\nThe International Paper Georgetown Mill is a modern, technologically advanced pulp and paper production facility.  The mill, originally built in 1937, manufactured the first paper in South Carolina.  In January 1982, International Paper\u00bfs board of directors voted to spend more than half a billion dollars to completely modernize the Georgetown Mill.  This conversion to the production of uncoated white papers and market pulp, while maintaining the production of bleached bristols, provided a mill capacity exceeding 700,000 tons per year.  \n\nThe Georgetown Mill is located on 900 acres of land just off Highway 17, in Georgetown County, South Carolina.  Approximately 730 workers team up to keep the Georgetown Mill safely operating at peak efficiency 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year.  Chlorine dioxide is utilized at the site to bleach pulp.  This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and by OSHA 1910.119 \u00bf Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThe Georgetown Mill\u00bfs key goals are to operate in 100% compliance with existing environmental regulations which include accurate and timely reporting, and striving for steady reduction of environmental impact.  The Georgetown Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public and the environment.  Our commitment is illustrated in or environmental policy.  Our policy states that \u00bfthe company will avoid causing any significant adverse effects on public health or th"

      "SummaryText": "e environment in which it operates.\u00bf\n\nAs part of this commitment, the Georgetown Mill has established a system that includes a classroom and on-the-job training, written operating procedures, process hazard analysis, incident investigations, computer safety interlocks and maintenance guidelines to help ensure the safe use of chlorine dioxide.  The facility maintains the components of this system by conducting visual inspections on a routine basis and performing nondestructive testing of tanks and piping to ensure that any potential failures are detected before they occur.  Highly skilled operators and mechanics, level controls, safety interlocks, emergency shutdown procedures, preventative maintenance requirements and restricted access procedures make a worst case release highly unlikely. \n\nThe Georgetown Mill has had no accidents (incidents) in the last five years that resulted in injuries or property damage.  If there is an incident with chlorine dioxide, a highly trained and skilled emergency response team is on standby 24 hours a day.  The Georgetown County Fire Department provides backup resources if needed.  Each year on-site drills are performed coordinating the city and county fire departments as well as members of the LEPC to familiarize all teams with the facility.  In addition, the LEPC, International Paper and other local industries have installed a Community Alert Network (CAN).  The CAN is designed to quickly notify residents and businesses of any emergencies such as chemical releases or natural disasters."
