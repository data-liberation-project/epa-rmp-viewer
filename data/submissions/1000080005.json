Street Wastewater Treatment Plant (HRSWWTP).  The HRSWWTP is located at 4100 Delta Drive in El Paso, Texas.  The location is depicted on the Site Location Map in Appendix C.  The plant is bordered to the south by the international boundary with Mexico, to the north by the El Paso County Coliseum, to the west by residential property and to the east by a park and city property. \n\n\n\n1.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nEPWU-PSB has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorination process at HRSWWTP, in compliance with 40CFR68, found in the EPA's General Risk Management Program Guidance (GRM- PG), the registration for this process is presented in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nThe RMP objectives are:\n\n?    Hazard Assessment-communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors\n\n?    Prevention Program-develop strategies to prevent an accidental release\n\n?    Emergency Response Program-formulate contingency planning in the case of an accidental release\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA&reg;) software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles.  The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards. The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 62,100 people; Mexico's potential affected population was unable to be determined however, a comparable population in Mexico resides within the vulnerable zone. The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint zone for both worst case and alternative scenarios. The following environmental receptors were"

The Rio Grande River is a natural and international border between Mexico and United States and provides habitat for aquatic wildlife. The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), is the responsible agency to monitor the ecosystem of the Rio Grande.\n\n\n\n2.    The Chamizal National Park -The Chamizal National Park is a fifty-nine acre urban park.  It is owned by the United States Government, is part of the National Park Service and serves primarily as a cultural center and contains art galleries, a theater and an amphitheater.\n\n\n\n3.    Ascarate Park-Ascarate Park is the largest public-use recreational park located in El Paso County and is dedicated to sports, picnicking, fishing and other recreational activities.  A lake is situated with the boundary of the park and is used for fishing and provides habitat for aquatic life. The park is owned and operated by El Paso County.\n\n\n\nThese three environmental receptors qualify as vulnerable zones in the worst case release scenario. There were no vulnerable zones found in the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-PSB's \"Emergency Response Action Plan\" and the Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 1 Chlorine Basics.  The Emergency Response Program incorporates an emergency response plan, equipment procedures and training in relevant procedures for employees involved in the chlorination process.  \n\n\n\nMexico and The United States created the Jointed Contingency Plan (JCP), designed for r"

The JCP provides a mechanism for cooperation between the El Paso, Texas, United States of America and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. The JCP is designed to protect the health, human safety and the environment by providing international guidance and coordinated responses between the two countries (Mexico-US).\n\n\n\n1.3 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the chlorination process operating procedures in order to make certain that the operators understand the human factors that may lead to accidental releases.  The emergency response plan is also reviewed and updated to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.  \n\n\n\n2 HAZARD ASSESSMENT (40CFR68 SUBPART B)\n\n\n\n2.1 APPLICIBILITY (? 68.20)\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act requires covered facilities to develop Risk Management Programs in an effort to \"prevent accidental releases and minimize the consequences of releases.\" Chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5), a regulated substance under section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act, has a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds as listed in Table 1 of ?68.130.  The HRSWWTP is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorination process at the facility utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity.  Currently, the HRSWWTP has the potential to store up to sixteen (16) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage area, a potential of 32,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\n\n\nUnder the RMP guidelines, the chlorination process at the HRSWWTP qualifies as a Program 2 process. The process is not listed as Program 3 because the facility is not covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements and the process is not part of the SIC codes listed in ?68.10(d)(1).  The chlorination process does not qualify for Program 1 status because a worst case release would reach a pu"

The toxic endpoint corresponds to a concentration of 3.0 parts per million (ppm).\n\n\n\n2.1.2 WIND SPEED AND ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY CLASS\n\nPer the RMP rule, a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and an F stability class, utilized in the worst case release analysis. Weak winds, nighttime cooling and little turbulent mixing characterize the F atmospheric stability class.  The atmosphere is considered stable under the F stability classification.  These wind and atmospheric conditions allow for maximum plume transport and are therefore appropriate for a worst case release analysis.\n\n\n\nThe atmospheric data used for the RMP's update was obtained from the National Weather Service (NWS) Office for the El Paso, Texas region. The NWS station is located at the Dona Ana County Airport at Santa Teresa, New Mexico, approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown El Paso.\n\n\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, the regulations allow the use of typical meteorological conditions for the geographic area. According to the NWS Office, the average wind speed for El Paso is 8.5 miles per hour (3.8 m/s). The atmospheric conditions would be best described by the C stability classification.  The C classification is representative of a neutral atmosphere with moderate turbulence. These wind and atmospheric conditions are more probable to occur and are therefore used in the alternative \"more likely\" release scenario.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY\n\nFor the worst case analysis, the RMP rule requires the use of the highest daily maximum temperature in the previous three years and the average humidity. The three-year (January 2016 through January 2019) maximum temperature for El Paso is 111?F and the daily average relative humidity is 37%.\n\n\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, the r"

The average temperature for El Paso is 69.1?F and the daily average relative humidity is 37%.\n\n2.2.4 HEIGHT RELEASE\n\nAs indicated in the RMP rule, the worst case scenario analysis assumes a ground level release (0 feet). For the alternative release analysis, the regulation indicates that the release height be determined by the release scenario.  Since the process area is near ground level, the release was assumed to occur at ground level.\n\n2.2.5 SURFACE ROUGHNESS\n\nThe software model used in the offsite consequence analysis considers the roughness length (Zo) of the terrain as a parameter in the transport analysis.  For example, Grass (artificial, 7.5 cm high), Grass (thin to 50 cm), Vegetation (1 m to 2 m high) and a Large City (Tokyo) have a roughness length of 1 cm, 5 cm, 20 cm and 165 cm, respectively.  Since the modeling software utilizes a heavy gas model, the software considers a roughness length of up to 10 cm.\n\n\n\nThe topography of the area near the chlorine process is urban with obstacles in the immediate area such as trees or small buildings. The topography of the area near the chlorine process is desert rangeland with residential housing developments and several industrial areas. A roughness length of 10 cm, the upper limit for the heavy gas model, was selected for both analyses\n\n2.2.6 DENSE OR NEUTRALLY BUOYANT GASES\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, the dispersion model utilized for the hazard assessment accounted for gas density.  Since chlorine gas is 2.4 times heavier than air, the heavy gas model in Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA&reg;) Version 5.4.7 was utilized for the dispersion analyses, instead of a buoyant gas model.\n\n2.2.7 TEMPERATURE OF RELEASEED SUBSTANCE\n\nFor the worst case analysis the RMP rule requires the use of the maximum of either the highest daily maximum temperature in the previous three years or the typical process temperature.

For modeling purposes, the chlorine was released at the average ambient temperature of 69.1?F.\n\n2.3 WORST CASE ANALYSIS (?68.25)\n\nThe worst case release scenario selected was the release of the entire contents of a one-ton chlorine container.  According to the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the worst case scenario \"need only consider the largest vessel, regardless of interconnections with pipes and other vessels.\"  The worst case analysis performed on the chlorine process indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles (Appendix B) as determined by the ALOHA&reg; modeling software.  The worst case analysis was conducted in compliance with the RMP rule, as presented below.\n\n2.3.1 NUMBER OF RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nFor the Program 2 process, the EPWU-PSB analyzed and reported \"one worst case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to [a toxic endpoint] resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes under worst case conditions\" (?68.25(2)(i)).\n\n2.3.2 DETERMINATION OF WORST CASE RELEASE QUANTITY\n\nThe RMP rule requires \"the worst case release quantity shall be the greater of the following: for substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity; or for substances in pipes, the greatest amount in pipe taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\" (?68.25(b)).  The one-ton (2,000-lb) worst case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by a single vessel.\n\n2.3.3 WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR TOXIC GASES\n\nAccording to the "

The mitigated release rate considered was 110 lb/min (Formula 1).\n\n2.3.4 PARAMETERS TO BE APPLIED\n\nThe parameters used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoints is discussed in Section 2.2. The RMP rule states \"the owner or operator may use the methodology in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance or any commercially or publicly available air dispersion modeling techniques, provided the techniques account for modeling conditions and are recognized by industry as applicable as part of current practices\" (?68.25(g)).  The air dispersion model used in the offsite consequence analyses was ALOHA&reg;.  The ALOHA&reg; transport and dispersion modeling software was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\n2.3.5 CONSIDERATION OF PASSIVE MITIGATION\n\nPassive mitigation systems are \"equipment, devices or technologies deployed to capture or control hazardous substances upon loss of containment, which function without human, mechanical or other energy input\" (?68.3).

New chlorine operators are given an initial training prior to the start of any work activities on the chlorine process.  In-house training on ERP procedures, PPE, and response equipment is conducted periodically with the chlorine operators and supervisory personnel.\n\n5.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN REVIEW \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan will be periodically reviewed.

The alternative release analysis performed on the chlorine process indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards (39 feet) (Appendix B). The ALOHA&reg; modeling software determined this radius after the appropriate parameter values were applied.

This software was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrative (NOAA).\n\n\n\nThe estimated population within the worst case release radius is approximately 62,100 persons and 23,100 housing units.  Mexico's potential affected population was unable to be determined however, a comparable population in Mexico resides within the vulnerable zone.  The estimated population that resides within the alternative release radius is approximately 0 persons.\n\n2.5.2 POPULATION TO BE DEFINED\n\nPer ?68.30(b), the RMP must note \"the presence of institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons), parks and recreational areas, and major commercial, office, and industrial, buildings.\"  The public receptors inside the worst case and alternative release scenario vulnerable zone are listed in Table 2-1 and Table 2- 2, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2-1: Public Receptors for Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nName    Approximate Distance from Process (mi.)

The contents of this section are summarized in the Safety Information Summary Sheet located in Appendix F.\n\n\n\n4.2.1 GENERAL SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials. Considering that the boiling point for chlorine is -29.4? F, contact with evaporating chlorine or equipment releasing flashing chlorine can cause frostbite burns.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will tend to travel along the ground and fill low spaces and pits displacing air.\n\n4.2.1.1 SAFETY DATA SHEETS\n\nA Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the chlorine process at the facility is included in Appendix G.  Per the RMP rule, the SDS meets the requirements of the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) 29 CFR 1910.1200(9).\n\n4.2.1.2 MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this facility is 32,000 pounds stored in sixteen (16) one-ton containers.\n\n\n\nTable 4-1: Maximum Intended Inventory\n\nChemical Name    Maximum Intended Inventory (pounds)\n\nChlorine    32,000\n\n4.2.1.3 SAFE OPERATING LEVELS\n\nStorage containers are designed for storage at the upper and lower extremes of ambient temperature in normal use and for the pressures that can develop at those temperatures (with additional safety factors).  One-ton containers of chlorine are designed to withstand pressures of at least 330 psig that can develop at a temperature of 165? F, the point at which the fusible plugs melt to relieve pressure in the event of a fire.  Temperatures may drop if chlorine gas is withdrawn to approaching the boiling point of-29.4? F, but are usually higher due to heat transfer from the surrounding"

In the event of a chlorine release, the possible health hazards may vary from skin and respiratory irritation to death.  According to the Chlorine lnstitute's Pamphlet 1, Chlorine Basics (8th ed.), \"As duration of exposure and/or concentration increases, the affected individual may develop rapid breathing, wheezing and hemoptysis.  In extreme cases difficulty in breathing can progress to the point of death through cardiovascular collapse from respiratory failure.\"  Permissible and recommended maximum exposure limits for chlorine gas are presented in Table 4-3.\n\n\n\nTable 4-3: Public Receptors for Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nExposure Limit    Chlorine Concentration (ppm)1    Source\n\nPEL-C2;ERPG-13    1.0    OSHA; AIHA\n\nERPG-24    3.0    AIHA\n\nIDLH5    10    OSHA\n\n\n\n1.

The JCP is designed to effectively respond to significant chemical hazardous contingencies, chlorine in this scenario.  It also aims to protect the health, human safety, and the environment by providing international guidance, joint, and coordinated responses between sister cities (Mexico-US).\n\n5.7.3 PLANNING AND PROCEDURES FOR AN EMERGENCY\n\nAfter EPWU-PSB have implemented its Emergency Evacuation Plan, Mexico/U.S. Co-chairs coordinating authorities must be notified of the major chlorine leak.\n\n5.7.4 VERBAL NOTIFICATION\n\nThe JCP requires that any chemical, in this scenario chlorine, that has a potential to affect the environment along Inland Border Area must be reported immediately to the following centers, telephone numbers are described in in Appendix S:\n\n1.    National Response Center (NRC)\n\n2.    U.S. EPA Regional Coordinator\n\n3.    U.S. JRT Co-chair\n\n4.    National Communications Center (CENACOM)\n\n5.    COATEA/PROFEPA\n\n6.    International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC)\n\n\n\nContact regulatory agencies by the ranking supervisor at the facility immediately after the incident has occurred.  Report immediately to the National Response Center (NRC) and later notify its counterpart, the National Communications Center (CENACOM), which operates 24 hours a day/7 days a week, providing the Notification Form requested by the JCP, provided in Appendix S.\n\n\n\nFollowing the JCP is the optimum rapid response for the sister cities in the event of an incident in international rivers and land.  Due to the nature of water treatment processes, other types of emergencies remain a possibility.  This plan represents the procedures during a worst case scenario realizing different actions may need to be taken for oth"
