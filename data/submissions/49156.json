The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency procedures and use of appropriate pretective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practriced in responding to ammonia emergencies. As a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Plan, Nash Finch Company, Cincinnati, Ohio (NFC) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of NFC's high degree of commitment to public safety and service. NFC is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-Site Consequence Analysis.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Nash Finch Company facility refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.

The worst-case and alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nA \"worst-case scenario off-site consequence analysis\" and an \"alternative scenario off-site consequence analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and much of the piping are inside the Nash Finch Company facility's building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps.\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention Program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStandard Operating Procedures\nSafework Practices\nEmployee and Operator Training Programs\nMechanical Integrity Program\nManagement of Change Procedures\nPSM Compliance Audit Procedures\nIncident Investigation Procedures\nEmployee Participation Program\nHot Work Permit Procedures\nContractor Safety Program\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\nAdministrative Controls\nOperator Training\nComputerized Controls\n\nThe Preventive Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process. Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n5.

Nash Finch Company is implmenting a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6. The emergency response program.\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. Nash Finch Company has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. NFC conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken is response to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\nNash Finch Company is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Off-Site consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows NFC to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of NFC employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
