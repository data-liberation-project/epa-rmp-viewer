This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Arch has designed and implemented and includes:\r\n \r\nA brief description of the facility and use of substances regulated by the EPA Risk Management regulation.\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of the worst case release and alternate case release scenarios required by the rule.\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of the site's accidental release prevention programs.\r\n\u00bf\tThe five year accident history for the facility.\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of the plant emergency response program.\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to minimize the number and severity of release incidents.\r\n\u00bf\tCertification of the executive summary and risk management plan.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Arch Rochester facility produces biocides, personal care intermediates, and specialty chemical products. The biocide products are ingredients in anti-dandruff shampoos, marine and anti-fouling paints, coatings, etc. They are also used to prevent formation of mold and mildew in wall board.\r\nPersonal care intermediate products are utilized in various lotions and creams. Specialty chemical products are used in pharmaceutical, paint, coatings, and other products. The Arch Rochester facility has been in operation since 1950, and it operates 24 hours per day seven days per week 365 days per year. The facility is ISO 9000 and SOCMA certified.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe EPA Risk Management regulation requires that each facility subject to the rule provide a worst case release scenario for toxic and flammable chemicals and an alternate release scena"

Chlorine is used as a raw material and is received in 90 ton railcars. The maximum inventory of chlorine on site would be approximately 1,260,000 pounds.\r\nArch does not handle any of the EPA listed flammable chemicals.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the worst case and alternate release scenarios for chlorine at the Arch Rochester facility and were developed using the Five-year Accident History and a review of the Process Hazard Analysis.  Human and environmental receptors that could be potentially impacted by the worst case and alternate release scenarios were identified using United States Census data, New York State Geographical Information Services Maps, and US Geologic Services Maps.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE\r\n\r\nAs required by the EPA Risk Management regulation, the worst case is presumed to be a release from the largest vessel or container. For this site, the largest vessel is the railcar that the chlorine is received in. Thus, using the assumptions required by the rule, the worst case release would be\r\n180,000 pounds of chlorine released to air in a 10 minute period with a wind speed of 1.5m/sec.\r\n\r\nALTERNATE RELEASE\r\n\r\nThe alternate release of chlorine assumes a leak and subsequent vaporization of chlorine from the\r\n2-chloropyridine manufacturing process. Therefore, the alternate release would be the entire contents of the chlorine process piping system released due to a piping or gasket failure. This incident would result in a release of approximately 667 pounds of chlorine (calculated from using the assumption of 83.4 lb/minute) and using the assumption that it would take eight minutes for the operator to be alerted by the chlorine monitor system and to shut off the emergency shut off valve on the chlorine railcar which is a reasonable estimate of human response time.  \r\n\r\nArch has implemented many safety layers to ensure that such a"

The facility conducts Chlorine Institute Emergency Kit C For Chlorine Tank Cars & Tank Trucks training in the event the other layers of protection have failed.  Additionally, the facility has an active Community Advisory Panel (CAP) that meets on a monthly basis to review the health & safety incidents and to which we communicate the status health & safety objectives for the site.\r\n\r\nAll of these elements work together to prevent accidents when handling chemicals. Arch is committed to provide a safe work place for its employees and a safe environment for its neighbors.\r\nArch has committed to a management system that minimizes the possibilities of a chemical release.\r\nThere is also a Vision of Zero initiative with the goal of achieving zero incidents of any kind--- zero injuries, zero accidental releases of chemicals, zero impact on its neighbors.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn December 12, 2018, an employee was hospitalized as a result of exposure to Chlorine (Cl2) gas.\r\nThe calculated amount of Cl2 gas released was 1.36 lbs. with no off-site impact or significant property damage.\r\n\r\nBelow is a timeline of events:\r\n\u00bf\tThe EAST Cl2 railcar went empty in the morning.\r\n\u00bf\tPreparations began for a railcar swap.\r\n\u00bf\tThe operator completed the venting and purge at ~12:30PM.\r\n\u00bf\tThe EAST Cl2 car was locked out.\r\n\u00bf\tMaintenance came to the control room with a permit to disconnect the Cl2 car.\r\n\u00bf\tThe site's safe work permit was filled out.\r\n\u00bf\tMaintenance proceeded to the WEST Cl2 railcar and initiated the disconnection of the Cl2 line (loosened a flange).\r\n\u00bf\tMaterial was observed leaking from the flange.\r\n\u00bf\tThe first Cl2 alarm came in at 13:18 on the 027A and 027D sensors.\r\n\u00bf\tBoth of these sensors are at the west end (ground level) of th"

The site's plan provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting the employees, the public, and the environment on an ongoing basis and during emergencies. \r\n\r\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe Arch Rochester facility is committed to the continual improvement of its safety and environmental programs and to the achievement of the Vision of Zero.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEnhanced incident investigation and root cause analysis/drill down and specific corrective actions to prevent recurrence of any safety or environmental incident.\r\n\u00bf\tReporting, tracking near miss incidents and investigation/corrective actions for serious events.\r\n\u00bf\tIncreased physical observation/behavioral based safety observations to eliminate at risk employee and contractor behaviors.\r\n\u00bf\tEnhanced contractor safety qualification/performance evaluation.\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATION\r\n\r\nThe undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information provided in this Risk Management Plan is t"
